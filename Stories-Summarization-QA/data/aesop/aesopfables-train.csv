The Frogs & the Ox,"An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud.The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him.""A great big monster,"" said one of them, ""stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!""""Big, was he!"" said the old Frog, puffing herself up. ""Was he as big as this?""""Oh, much bigger!"" they cried.The Frog puffed up still more.""He could not have been bigger than this,"" she said. But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at once, she burst.Do not attempt the impossible.",Do not attempt the impossible.
The Town Mouse & the Country Mouse,"A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite.After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the House Dog.The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella.""You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not,"" she said as she hurried away, ""but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it.""Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.",Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.
The Gnat & the Bull,"A Gnat flew over the meadow with much buzzing for so small a creature and settled on the tip of one of the horns of a Bull. After he had rested a short time, he made ready to fly away. But before he left he begged the Bull's pardon for having used his horn for a resting place.""You must be very glad to have me go now,"" he said.""It's all the same to me,"" replied the Bull. ""I did not even know you were there.""We are often of greater importance in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbor. The smaller the mind the greater the conceit.",We are often of greater importance in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbor. The smaller the mind the greater the conceit.
The Plane Tree,"Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.""How useless is the Plane!"" said one of them. ""It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves.""""Ungrateful creatures!"" said a voice from the Plane Tree. ""You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!""Our best blessings are often the least appreciated.",Our best blessings are often the least appreciated.
The Wolf & the Crane,"A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf.So away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out.""I will reward you very handsomely,"" said the Wolf, ""if you pull that bone out for me.""The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away.""But what about my reward!"" called the Crane anxiously.""What!"" snarled the Wolf, whirling around. ""Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?""Expect no reward for serving the wicked.",Expect no reward for serving the wicked.
Belling the Cat,"The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day.Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said:""I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming.""All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:""I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?""It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.","It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it."
The Fox & the Grapes,"A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.""What a fool I am,"" he said. ""Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.""And off he walked very, very scornfully.There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.",There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.
The Lion & the Mouse,"A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.""Spare me!"" begged the poor Mouse. ""Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you.""The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.""You laughed when I said I would repay you,"" said the Mouse. ""Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion.""A kindness is never wasted.",A kindness is never wasted.
The Owl & the Grasshopper,"The Owl always takes her sleep during the day. Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird ""hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo"" echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat.Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window.""Get away from here, sir,"" she said to the Grasshopper. ""Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!""But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune.The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him.""Well sir,"" she said, ""if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself.""The foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words. Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up.Flattery is not a proof of true admiration. Do not let flattery throw you off your guard against an enemy.",Flattery is not a proof of true admiration. Do not let flattery throw you off your guard against an enemy.
The Oak & the Reeds,"A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds. When the wind blew, the great Oak stood proudly upright with its hundred arms uplifted to the sky. But the Reeds bowed low in the wind and sang a sad and mournful song.""You have reason to complain,"" said the Oak. ""The slightest breeze that ruffles the surface of the water makes you bow your heads, while I, the mighty Oak, stand upright and firm before the howling tempest.""""Do not worry about us,"" replied the Reeds. ""The winds do not harm us. We bow before them and so we do not break. You, in all your pride and strength, have so far resisted their blows. But the end is coming.""As the Reeds spoke a great hurricane rushed out of the north. The Oak stood proudly and fought against the storm, while the yielding Reeds bowed low. The wind redoubled in fury, and all at once the great tree fell, torn up by the roots, and lay among the pitying Reeds.Better to yield when it is folly to resist, than to resist stubbornly and be destroyed.","Better to yield when it is folly to resist, than to resist stubbornly and be destroyed."
The Crow & the Pitcher,"In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tried, the Crow could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst.Then an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink.In a pinch a good use of our wits may help us out.",In a pinch a good use of our wits may help us out.
The Two Goats,"Two Goats, frisking gayly on the rocky steeps of a mountain valley, chanced to meet, one on each side of a deep chasm through which poured a mighty mountain torrent. The trunk of a fallen tree formed the only means of crossing the chasm, and on this not even two squirrels could have passed each other in safety. The narrow path would have made the bravest tremble. Not so our Goats. Their pride would not permit either to stand aside for the other.One set her foot on the log. The other did likewise. In the middle they met horn to horn. Neither would give way, and so they both fell, to be swept away by the roaring torrent below.It is better to yield than to come to misfortune through stubbornness.",It is better to yield than to come to misfortune through stubbornness.
The Wild Boar & the Fox,"A Wild Boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree, when a Fox happened by. Now the Fox was always looking for a chance to make fun of his neighbors. So he made a great show of looking anxiously about, as if in fear of some hidden enemy. But the Boar kept right on with his work.""Why are you doing that?"" asked the Fox at last with a grin. ""There isn't any danger that I can see.""""True enough,"" replied the Boar, ""but when danger does come there will not be time for such work as this. My weapons will have to be ready for use then, or I shall suffer for it.""Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.",Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.
The Fox & the Stork,"The Fox one day thought of a plan to amuse himself at the expense of the Stork, at whose odd appearance he was always laughing.""You must come and dine with me today,"" he said to the Stork, smiling to himself at the trick he was going to play. The Stork gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite.For dinner the Fox served soup. But it was set out in a very shallow dish, and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his bill. Not a drop of soup could he get. But the Fox lapped it up easily, and, to increase the disappointment of the Stork, made a great show of enjoyment.The hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick, but he was a calm, even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage. Instead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and the Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The Stork could easily get at the food with his long bill, but all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor. And when the Fox lost his temper, the Stork said calmly:Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.",Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.
The Cock & the Fox,"One bright evening as the sun was sinking on a glorious world a wise old Cock flew into a tree to roost. Before he composed himself to rest, he flapped his wings three times and crowed loudly. But just as he was about to put his head under his wing, his beady eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of a long pointed nose, and there just below him stood Master Fox.""Have you heard the wonderful news?"" cried the Fox in a very joyful and excited manner.""What news?"" asked the Cock very calmly. But he had a queer, fluttery feeling inside him, for, you know, he was very much afraid of the Fox.""Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forget their differences and live in peace and friendship from now on forever. Just think of it! I simply cannot wait to embrace you! Do come down, dear friend, and let us celebrate the joyful event.""""How grand!"" said the Cock. ""I certainly am delighted at the news."" But he spoke in an absent way, and stretching up on tiptoes, seemed to be looking at something afar off.""What is it you see?"" asked the Fox a little anxiously.""Why, it looks to me like a couple of Dogs coming this way. They must have heard the good news and""But the Fox did not wait to hear more. Off he started on a run.""Wait,"" cried the Cock. ""Why do you run? The Dogs are friends of yours now!""""Yes,"" answered the Fox. ""But they might not have heard the news. Besides, I have a very important errand that I had almost forgotten about.""The Cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went to sleep, for he had succeeded in outwitting a very crafty enemy.The trickster is easily tricked.",The trickster is easily tricked.
The Heron,"A Heron was walking sedately along the bank of a stream, his eyes on the clear water, and his long neck and pointed bill ready to snap up a likely morsel for his breakfast. The clear water swarmed with fish, but Master Heron was hard to please that morning.""No small fry for me,"" he said. ""Such scanty fare is not fit for a Heron.""Now a fine young Perch swam near.""No indeed,"" said the Heron. ""I wouldn't even trouble to open my beak for anything like that!""As the sun rose, the fish left the shallow water near the shore and swam below into the cool depths toward the middle. The Heron saw no more fish, and very glad was he at last to breakfast on a tiny Snail.Do not be too hard to suit or you may have to be content with the worst or with nothing at all.",Do not be too hard to suit or you may have to be content with the worst or with nothing at all.
The Stag & His Reflection,"A Stag, drinking from a crystal spring, saw himself mirrored in the clear water. He greatly admired the graceful arch of his antlers, but he was very much ashamed of his spindling legs.""How can it be,"" he sighed, ""that I should be cursed with such legs when I have so magnificent a crown.""At that moment he scented a panther and in an instant was bounding away through the forest. But as he ran his wide-spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and soon the Panther overtook him. Then the Stag perceived that the legs of which he was so ashamed would have saved him had it not been for the useless ornaments on his head.We often make much of the ornamental and despise the useful.",We often make much of the ornamental and despise the useful.
The Fox & the Goat,"A Fox fell into a well, and though it was not very deep, he found that he could not get out again. After he had been in the well a long time, a thirsty Goat came by. The Goat thought the Fox had gone down to drink, and so he asked if the water was good.""The finest in the whole country,"" said the crafty Fox, ""jump in and try it. There is more than enough for both of us.""The thirsty Goat immediately jumped in and began to drink. The Fox just as quickly jumped on the Goat's back and leaped from the tip of the Goat's horns out of the wellThe foolish Goat now saw what a plight he had got into, and begged the Fox to help him out. But the Fox was already on his way to the woods""If you had as much sense as you have beard, old fellow,"" he said as he ran, ""you would have been more cautious about finding a way to get out again before you jumped in.""Look before you leap.",Look before you leap.
The Fox & the Leopard,"A Fox and a Leopard, resting lazily after a generous dinner, amused themselves by disputing about their good looks. The Leopard was very proud of his glossy, spotted coat and made disdainful remarks about the Fox, whose appearance he declared was quite ordinary.The Fox prided himself on his fine bushy tail with its tip of white, but he was wise enough to see that he could not rival the Leopard in looks. Still he kept up a flow of sarcastic talk, just to exercise his wits and to have the fun of disputing. The Leopard was about to lose his temper when the Fox got up, yawning lazily.""You may have a very smart coat,"" he said, ""but you would be a great deal better off if you had a little more smartness inside your head and less on your ribs, the way I am. That's what I call real beauty.""A fine coat is not always an indication of an attractive mind.",A fine coat is not always an indication of an attractive mind.
The Frog & the Mouse,"A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a Frog. When the Frog saw the Mouse, he swam to the bank and croaked:""Won't you pay me a visit? I can promise you a good time if you do.""The Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help.The Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him.The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner.Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit.",Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit.
The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,"A certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the Shepherds. But one night he found a sheep skin that had been cast aside and forgotten. The next day, dressed in the skin, the Wolf strolled into the pasture with the Sheep. Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quickly led away to slaughter.That evening the Wolf entered the fold with the flock. But it happened that the Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth that very evening, and, picking up a knife, went to the fold. There the first he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf.The evil doer often comes to harm through his own deceit.",The evil doer often comes to harm through his own deceit.
The Eagle & the Beetle,"A Beetle once begged the Eagle to spare a Hare which had run to her for protection. But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at the disrespect shown her, the Beetle flew to the Eagle's nest and rolled out the eggs. Not one did she spare. The Eagle's grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know.Next year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain crag; but the Beetle found it and again destroyed the eggs. In despair the Eagle now implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap. There none would dare harm them. But the Beetle buzzed about Jupiter's head, and made him rise to drive her away; and the eggs rolled from his lap.Now the Beetle told the reason for her action, and Jupiter had to acknowledge the justice of her cause. And they say that ever after, while the Eagle's eggs lie in the nest in spring, the Beetle still sleeps in the ground. For so Jupiter commanded.Even the weakest may find means to avenge a wrong.",Even the weakest may find means to avenge a wrong.
The Mother & the Wolf,"Early one morning a hungry Wolf was prowling around a cottage at the edge of a village, when he heard a child crying in the house. Then he heard the Mother's voice say:""Hush, child, hush! Stop your crying, or I will give you to the Wolf!""Surprised but delighted at the prospect of so delicious a meal, the Wolf settled down under an open window, expecting every moment to have the child handed out to him. But though the little one continued to fret, the Wolf waited all day in vain. Then, toward nightfall, he heard the Mother's voice again as she sat down near the window to sing and rock her baby to sleep.""There, child, there! The Wolf shall not get you. No, no! Daddy is watching and Daddy will kill him if he should come near!""Just then the Father came within sight of the home, and the Wolf was barely able to save himself from the Dogs by a clever bit of running.Do not believe everything you hear.",Do not believe everything you hear.
The Hare & the Tortoise,"A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.""Do you ever get anywhere?"" he asked with a mocking laugh.""Yes,"" replied the Tortoise, ""and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it.""The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.The race is not always to the swift.",The race is not always to the swift.
The Ant & the Dove,"A Dove saw an Ant fall into a brook. The Ant struggled in vain to reach the bank, and in pity, the Dove dropped a blade of straw close beside it. Clinging to the straw like a shipwrecked sailor to a broken spar, the Ant floated safely to shore.Soon after, the Ant saw a man getting ready to kill the Dove with a stone. But just as he cast the stone, the Ant stung him in the heel, so that the pain made him miss his aim, and the startled Dove flew to safety in a distant wood.A kindness is never wasted.",A kindness is never wasted.
The Man & the Satyr,"A long time ago a Man met a Satyr in the forest and succeeded in making friends with him. The two soon became the best of comrades, living together in the Man's hut. But one cold winter evening, as they were walking homeward, the Satyr saw the Man blow on his fingers.""Why do you do that?"" asked the Satyr.""To warm my hands,"" the Man replied.When they reached home the Man prepared two bowls of porridge. These he placed steaming hot on the table, and the comrades sat down very cheerfully to enjoy the meal. But much to the Satyr's surprise, the Man began to blow into his bowl of porridge.""Why do you do that?"" he asked.""To cool my porridge,"" replied the Man.The Satyr sprang hurriedly to his feet and made for the door.""Goodby,"" he said, ""I've seen enough. A fellow that blows hot and cold in the same breath cannot be friends with me!""The man who talks for both sides is not to be trusted by either.",The man who talks for both sides is not to be trusted by either.
The Fox & the Crow,"One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen. What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak.""No need to search any farther,"" thought sly Master Fox. ""Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast.""Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, ""Good-morning, beautiful creature!""The Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting.""What a charming creature she is!"" said the Fox. ""How her feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could she sing just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds.""Listening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and also her breakfast. She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds.So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth.""Thank you,"" said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off.

But where are your wits?""The flatterer lives at the expense of those who will listen to him.",The flatterer lives at the expense of those who will listen to him.
The Dog & His Reflection,"A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.If he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead of thinking, he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the river, only to find himself swimming for dear life to reach the shore. At last he managed to scramble out, and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost, he realized what a stupid Dog he had been.It is very foolish to be greedy.",It is very foolish to be greedy.
The Fisherman & the Little Fish,"A poor Fisherman, who lived on the fish he caught, had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fry. The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said:""Please spare me, Mr. Fisherman! I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal.""But the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket.""How foolish I should be,"" he said, ""to throw you back. However small you may be, you are better than nothing at all.""A small gain is worth more than a large promise.",A small gain is worth more than a large promise.
The Hare & His Ears,"The Lion had been badly hurt by the horns of a Goat, which he was eating. He was very angry to think that any animal that he chose for a meal, should be so brazen as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch him while he ate. So he commanded that all animals with horns should leave his domains within twenty-four hours.The command struck terror among the beasts. All those who were so unfortunate as to have horns, began to pack up and move out. Even the Hare, who, as you know, has no horns and so had nothing to fear, passed a very restless night, dreaming awful dreams about the fearful Lion.And when he came out of the warren in the early morning sunshine, and there saw the shadow cast by his long and pointed ears, a terrible fright seized him.""Goodby, neighbor Cricket,"" he called. ""I'm off. He will certainly make out that my ears are horns, no matter what I say.""Do not give your enemies the slightest reason to attack your reputation.

""You should always walk straight forward with your toes turned out.""""Show me how to walk, mother dear,"" answered the little Crab obediently, ""I want to learn.""So the old Crab tried and tried to walk straight forward. But she could walk sideways only, like her son. And when she wanted to turn her toes out she tripped and fell on her nose.Do not tell others how to act unless you can set a good example.",Do not tell others how to act unless you can set a good example.
"The Dog, the Cock, & the Fox","A Dog and a Cock, who were the best of friends, wished very much to see something of the world. So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of.At nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he thought would do very nicely for a night's lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably.With the first glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip-toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a Fox not far off in the wood. The Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting, he said very politely:""A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here. I am quite sure we shall become the closest of friends.""""I feel highly flattered, kind sir,"" replied the Cock slyly. ""If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree, my porter will let you in.""The hungry but unsuspecting Fox, went around the tree as he was told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized him.Those who try to deceive may expect to be paid in their own coin.",Those who try to deceive may expect to be paid in their own coin.
The Eagle & the Jackdaw,"An Eagle, swooping down on powerful wings, seized a lamb in her talons and made off with it to her nest. A Jackdaw saw the deed, and his silly head was filled with the idea that he was big and strong enough to do as the Eagle had done. So with much rustling of feathers and a fierce air, he came down swiftly on the back of a large Ram. But when he tried to rise again he found that he could not get away, for his claws were tangled in the wool. And so far was he from carrying away the Ram, that the Ram hardly noticed he was there.The Shepherd saw the fluttering Jackdaw and at once guessed what had happened. Running up, he caught the bird and clipped its wings. That evening he gave the Jackdaw to his children.""What a funny bird this is!"" they said laughing, ""what do you call it, father?""""That is a Jackdaw, my children.

The Tortoise & the Ducks,"The Tortoise, you know, carries his house on his back. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot leave home. They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he would not go to Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited.After many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds flew about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to see the world too, and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly drag him along.One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble.""We can help you to see the world,"" said the Ducks. ""Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry.""The Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds.Just then a Crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried:""This must surely be the King of Tortoises!""""Why certainly"" began the Tortoise.But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his hold on the stick, and down he fell to the ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock.Foolish curiosity and vanity often lead to misfortune.",Foolish curiosity and vanity often lead to misfortune.
The Kid & the Wolf,"""A frisky young Kid had been left by the herdsman on the thatched roof of a sheep shelter to keep him out of harm's way. The Kid was browsing near the edge of the roof, when he spied a Wolf and began to jeer at him, making faces and abusing him to his heart's content.""I hear you,"" said the Wolf, ""and I haven't the least grudge against you for what you say or do.

The Wolf & the Kid,"There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone.He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf!The Kid knew there was little hope for him.""Please, Mr. Wolf,"" he said trembling, ""I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.""The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily.Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.Do not let anything turn you from your purpose

Hercules & the Wagoner,"A Farmer was driving his wagon along a miry country road after a heavy rain. The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank to the hub in a rut.The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon looking at it but without making the least effort to get it out of the rut. All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to his aid. Then, it is said, Hercules really did appear, saying:""Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses. Do you think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it and whining about it? Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself.""And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses, the wagon moved very readily, and soon the Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned.Self help is the best help.

The Bundle of Sticks,"A certain Father had a family of Sons, who were forever quarreling among themselves.

Then handing the bundle to each of his Sons in turn he told them to try to break it. But although each one tried his best, none was able to do so.The Father then untied the bundle and gave the sticks to his Sons to break one by one. This they did very easily.""My Sons,"" said the Father, ""do you not see how certain it is that if you agree with each other and help each other, it will be impossible for your enemies to injure you?

They had to use all their strength to pull the wagon, but they did not complain.The Wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Though the task they had to do was very light compared with that of the Oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor Oxen, pulling with all their might to draw the wagon through the deep mud, had their ears filled with the loud complaining of the Wheels.

But in spite of its squeals and struggles to escape, the Shepherd tucked his prize under his arm and started off to the butcher's in the market place.The Sheep in the pasture were much astonished and amused at the Pig's behavior, and followed the Shepherd and his charge to the pasture gate.""What makes you squeal like that?"" asked one of the Sheep. ""The Shepherd often catches and carries off one of us. But we should feel very much ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do.""""That is all very well,"" replied the Pig, with a squeal and a frantic kick.

All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe.One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself.His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, ""Wolf! Wolf!""As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them.A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, ""Wolf! Wolf!"" Again the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again.Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep.In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting ""Wolf! Wolf!"" But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before.

The Frogs Who Wished for a King,"The Frogs were tired of governing themselves. They had so much freedom that it had spoiled them, and they did nothing but sit around croaking in a bored manner and wishing for a government that could entertain them with the pomp and display of royalty, and rule them in a way to make them know they were being ruled. No milk and water government for them, they declared. So they sent a petition to Jupiter asking for a king.Jupiter saw what simple and foolish creatures they were, but to keep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw down a huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. The Frogs hid themselves among the reeds and grasses, thinking the new king to be some fearful giant. But they soon discovered how tame and peaceable King Log was. In a short time the younger Frogs were using him for a diving platform, while the older Frogs made him a meeting place, where they complained loudly to Jupiter about the government.To teach the Frogs a lesson the ruler of the gods now sent a Crane to be king of Frogland. The Crane proved to be a very different sort of king from old King Log. He gobbled up the poor Frogs right and left and they soon saw what fools they had been. In mournful croaks they begged Jupiter to take away the cruel tyrant before they should all be destroyed.""How now!"" cried Jupiter ""Are you not yet content?

What in the world were you doing all last summer?""""I didn't have time to store up any food,"" whined the Grasshopper; ""I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone.""The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust.""Making music, were you?"" they cried.

A Raven & a Swan,"A Raven, which you know is black as coal, was envious of the Swan, because her feathers were as white as the purest snow. The foolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the Swan, swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and plants that grow in the water, his feathers would turn white like the Swan's.So he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes. But though he washed and washed all day long, almost drowning himself at it, his feathers remained as black as ever.

Delighted to find how much lighter his burden had become, the Ass finished the journey very gayly.Next day the Merchant went for another load of salt. On the way home the Ass, remembering what had happened at the ford, purposely let himself fall into the water, and again got rid of most of his burden.The angry Merchant immediately turned about and drove the Ass back to the seashore, where he loaded him with two great baskets of sponges.

But in the midst of his song, his driver guessed what the Ass had got into his head, and began to beat him unmercifully with a stick.""Go along with you, you stupid Ass,"" he cried.

He was very sure that he could dance quite as well as the Monkey, if not better, so he pushed his way into the crowd that was gathered around the Monkey, and rising on his hind legs, began to dance. But the big hulking Camel made himself very ridiculous as he kicked out his knotty legs and twisted his long clumsy neck. Besides, the animals found it hard to keep their toes from under his heavy hoofs.At last, when one of his huge feet came within an inch of King Lion's nose, the animals were so disgusted that they set upon the Camel in a rage and drove him out into the desert.Shortly afterward, refreshments, consisting mostly of Camel's hump and ribs, were served to the company.Do not try to ape your betters.",Do not try to ape your betters.

""You deserve to be punished severely for your rashness!""""But, your highness,"" replied the trembling Lamb, ""do not be angry! I cannot possibly muddy the water you are drinking up there.

"The Birds, the Beasts, & the Bat","The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other. No compromise was possible, and so they went at it tooth and claw.

Chickens and Geese fell by the scoreand the victor always stopped for a feast.Now the Bat family had not openly joined either side. They were a very politic race.

The Peacock,"The Peacock, they say, did not at first have the beautiful feathers in which he now takes so much pride.

Even the most beautiful pheasant could see that his beauty was surpassed.Presently the Peacock saw an Eagle soaring high up in the blue sky and felt a desire to fly, as he had been accustomed to do. Lifting his wings he tried to rise from the ground. But the weight of his magnificent train held him down.

So a large number of generals and commanders were appointed from among the most eminent Mice.To distinguish themselves from the soldiers in the ranks, the new leaders proudly bound on their heads lofty crests and ornaments of feathers or straw. Then after long preparation of the Mouse army in all the arts of war, they sent a challenge to the Weasels.The Weasels accepted the challenge with eagerness, for they were always ready for a fight when a meal was in sight. They immediately attacked the Mouse army in large numbers. Soon the Mouse line gave way before the attack and the whole army fled for cover. The privates easily slipped into their holes, but the Mouse leaders could not squeeze through the narrow openings because of their head-dresses. Not one escaped the teeth of the hungry Weasels.Greatness has its penalties.",Greatness has its penalties.
The Wolf & the Lean Dog,"A Wolf prowling near a village one evening met a Dog. It happened to be a very lean and bony Dog, and Master Wolf would have turned up his nose at such meager fare had he not been more hungry than usual. So he began to edge toward the Dog, while the Dog backed away.""Let me remind your lordship,"" said the Dog, his words interrupted now and then as he dodged a snap of the Wolf's teeth, ""how unpleasant it would be to eat me now. Look at my ribs. I am nothing but skin and bone. But let me tell you something in private. In a few days my master will give a wedding feast for his only daughter. You can guess how fine and fat I will grow on the scraps from the table. Then is the time to eat me.""The Wolf could not help thinking how nice it would be to have a fine fat Dog to eat instead of the scrawny object before him. So he went away pulling in his belt and promising to return.Some days later the Wolf came back for the promised feast. He found the Dog in his master's yard, and asked him to come out and be eaten.""Sir,"" said the Dog, with a grin, ""I shall be delighted to have you eat me. I'll be out as soon as the porter opens the door.""But the ""porter"" was a huge Dog whom the Wolf knew by painful experience to be very unkind toward wolves.

The Dog & His Master's Dinner,"A Dog had learned to carry his master's dinner to him every day. He was very faithful to his duty, though the smell of the good things in the basket tempted him.The Dogs in the neighborhood noticed him carrying the basket and soon discovered what was in it. They made several attempts to steal it from him. But he always guarded it faithfully.Then one day all the Dogs in the neighborhood got together and met him on his way with the basket. The Dog tried to run away from them. But at last he stopped to argue.That was his mistake.

The Vain Jackdaw & his Borrowed Feathers,"A Jackdaw chanced to fly over the garden of the King's palace. There he saw with much wonder and envy a flock of royal Peacocks in all the glory of their splendid plumage.Now the black Jackdaw was not a very handsome bird, nor very refined in manner. Yet he imagined that all he needed to make himself fit for the society of the Peacocks was a dress like theirs. So he picked up some castoff feathers of the Peacocks and stuck them among his own black plumes.Dressed in his borrowed finery he strutted loftily among the birds of his own kind. Then he flew down into the garden among the Peacocks. But they soon saw who he was. Angry at the cheat, they flew at him, plucking away the borrowed feathers and also some of his own.The poor Jackdaw returned sadly to his former companions.

The Monkey & the Dolphin,"It happened once upon a time that a certain Greek ship bound for Athens was wrecked off the coast close to Piraeus, the port of Athens. Had it not been for the Dolphins, who at that time were very friendly toward mankind and especially toward Athenians, all would have perished. But the Dolphins took the shipwrecked people on their backs and swam with them to shore.Now it was the custom among the Greeks to take their pet monkeys and dogs with them whenever they went on a voyage. So when one of the Dolphins saw a Monkey struggling in the water, he thought it was a man, and made the Monkey climb up on his back. Then off he swam with him toward the shore.The Monkey sat up, grave and dignified, on the Dolphin's back.""You are a citizen of illustrious Athens, are you not?"" asked the Dolphin politely.""Yes,"" answered the Monkey, proudly. ""My family is one of the noblest in the city.""""Indeed,"" said the Dolphin. ""Then of course you often visit Piraeus.""""Yes, yes,"" replied the Monkey. ""Indeed, I do. I am with him constantly. Piraeus is my very best friend.""This answer took the Dolphin by surprise, and, turning his head, he now saw what it was he was carrying.

The Monkey & the Cat,"Once upon a time a Cat and a Monkey lived as pets in the same house. They were great friends and were constantly in all sorts of mischief together. What they seemed to think of more than anything else was to get something to eat, and it did not matter much to them how they got it.One day they were sitting by the fire, watching some chestnuts roasting on the hearth. How to get them was the question.""I would gladly get them,"" said the cunning Monkey, ""but you are much more skillful at such things than I am. Pull them out and I'll divide them between us.""Pussy stretched out her paw very carefully, pushed aside some of the cinders, and drew back her paw very quickly. Then she tried it again, this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire. A third time and she drew out the chestnut. This performance she went through several times, each time singeing her paw severely. As fast as she pulled the chestnuts out of the fire, the Monkey ate them up.Now the master came in, and away scampered the rascals, Mistress Cat with a burnt paw and no chestnuts. From that time on, they say, she contented herself with mice and rats and had little to do with Sir Monkey.The flatterer seeks some benefit at your expense.",The flatterer seeks some benefit at your expense.
The Dogs & and the Hides,"Some hungry Dogs saw a number of hides at the bottom of a stream where the Tanner had put them to soak. A fine hide makes an excellent meal for a hungry Dog, but the water was deep and the Dogs could not reach the hides from the bank. So they held a council and decided that the very best thing to do was to drink up the river.All fell to lapping up the water as fast as they could. But though they drank and drank until, one after another, all of them had burst with drinking, still, for all their effort, the water in the river remained as high as ever.Do not try to do impossible things.",Do not try to do impossible things.

He easily guessed what the Wolf had in mind, and thought of a plan to save himself. So he pretended he was lame, and began to hobble painfully.When the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass what had made him lame, and the Ass replied that he had stepped on a sharp thorn.""Please pull it out,"" he pleaded, groaning as if in pain. ""If you do not, it might stick in your throat when you eat me.""The Wolf saw the wisdom of the advice, for he wanted to enjoy his meal without any danger of choking. So the Ass lifted up his foot and the Wolf began to search very closely and carefully for the thorn.Just then the Ass kicked out with all his might, tumbling the Wolf a dozen paces away. And while the Wolf was getting very slowly and painfully to his feet, the Ass galloped away in safety.""Serves me right,"" growled the Wolf as he crept into the bushes. ""I'm a butcher by trade, not a doctor.""Stick to your trade.",Stick to your trade.
The Dogs & the Fox,"Some Dogs found the skin of a Lion and furiously began to tear it with their teeth.

Guessing what the Bear was after, the Bee flew at him, stung him sharply and then disappeared into the hollow log.The Bear lost his temper in an instant, and sprang upon the log tooth and claw, to destroy the nest. But this only brought out the whole swarm. The poor Bear had to take to his heels, and he was able to save himself only by diving into a pool of water.It is wiser to bear a single injury in silence than to provoke a thousand by flying into a rage.",It is wiser to bear a single injury in silence than to provoke a thousand by flying into a rage.
The Dog in the Manger,"A Dog asleep in a manger filled with hay, was awakened by the Cattle, which came in tired and hungry from working in the field. But the Dog would not let them get near the manger, and snarled and snapped as if it were filled with the best of meat and bones, all for himself.The Cattle looked at the Dog in disgust.

But when he came back and saw how many of the flock had been killed and carried off, he knew how foolish to trust a Wolf.Once a wolf, always a wolf.","Once a wolf, always a wolf."
The Ass & the Grasshoppers,"One day as an Ass was walking in the pasture, he found some Grasshoppers chirping merrily in a grassy corner of the field.He listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of the Grasshoppers. It was such a joyful song that his pleasure-loving heart was filled with a wish to sing as they did.""What is it?"" he asked very respectfully, ""that has given you such beautiful voices? Is there any special food you eat, or is it some divine nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully?""""Yes,"" said the Grasshoppers, who were very fond of a joke; ""it is the dew we drink!

And this is the story he told his mother about his adventures.""I was strolling along very peaceably when, just as I turned the corner into the next yard, I saw two strange creatures. One of them had a very kind and gracious look, but the other was the most fearful monster you can imagine. You should have seen him.""On top of his head and in front of his neck hung pieces of raw red meat. He walked about restlessly, tearing up the ground with his toes, and beating his arms savagely against his sides. The moment he caught sight of me he opened his pointed mouth as if to swallow me, and then he let out a piercing roar that frightened me almost to death.""Can you guess who it was that our young Mouse was trying to describe to his mother? It was nobody but the Barnyard Cock and the first one the little Mouse had ever seen.""If it had not been for that terrible monster,"" the Mouse went on, ""I should have made the acquaintance of the pretty creature, who looked so good and gentle. He had thick, velvety fur, a meek face, and a look that was very modest, though his eyes were bright and shining. As he looked at me he waved his fine long tail and smiled.""I am sure he was just about to speak to me when the monster I have told you about let out a screaming yell, and I ran for my life.""""My son,"" said the Mother Mouse, ""that gentle creature you saw was none other than the Cat. Under his kindly appearance, he bears a grudge against every one of us. The other was nothing but a bird who wouldn't harm you in the least. As for the Cat, he eats us.

I do not know the exact spot, but it is there, and you will surely find it.

He had had experience with such birds before. He soon returned to the field with a sling. But he did not bring any stones with him. He expected to scare the Cranes just by swinging the sling in the air, and shouting loudly at them.At first the Cranes flew away in great terror. But they soon began to see that none of them ever got hurt. They did not even hear the noise of stones whizzing through the air, and as for words, they would kill nobody. At last they paid no attention whatever to the Farmer.The Farmer saw that he would have to take other measures. He wanted to save at least some of his grain. So he loaded his sling with stones and killed several of the Cranes.

The Two Pots,"Two Pots, one of brass and the other of clay, stood together on the hearthstone. One day the Brass Pot proposed to the Earthen Pot that they go out into the world together.

The least shock is sure to shatter me!""""Don't let that keep you at home,"" urged the Brass Pot. ""I shall take very good care of you.

Indeed he he became about three times as big around the middle as he was when he went in.At last he felt satisfied and dragged himself to the opening to get out again.

Three Bullocks & a lion,"A Lion had been watching three Bullocks feeding in an open field. He had tried to attack them several times, but they had kept together, and helped each other to drive him off. The Lion had little hope of eating them, for he was no match for three strong Bullocks with their sharp horns and hoofs. But he could not keep away from that field, for it is hard to resist watching a good meal, even when there is little chance of getting it.Then one day the Bullocks had a quarrel, and when the hungry Lion came to look at them and lick his chops as he was accustomed to do, he found them in separate corners of the field, as far away from one another as they could get.It was now an easy matter for the Lion to attack them one at a time, and this he proceeded to do with the greatest satisfaction and relish.In unity is strength.",In unity is strength.

As they pulled him out of the mud, one of them said:""You pretend to read the future in the stars, and yet you fail to see what is at your feet!

Thus it happened that the axe slipped and flew out of his hands into the pool.The Woodman was in despair. The axe was all he possessed with which to make a living, and he had not money enough to buy a new one. As he stood wringing his hands and weeping, the god Mercury suddenly appeared and asked what the trouble was. The Woodman told what had happened, and straightway the kind Mercury dived into the pool. When he came up again he held a wonderful golden axe.""Is this your axe?"" Mercury asked the Woodman.""No,"" answered the honest Woodman, ""that is not my axe.""Mercury laid the golden axe on the bank and sprang back into the pool.

They hurried out into the woods, one here, one there, and hiding their axes in the bushes, pretended they had lost them. Then they wept and wailed and called on Mercury to help them.And indeed, Mercury did appear, first to this one, then to that. To each one he showed an axe of gold, and each one eagerly claimed it to be the one he had lost. But Mercury did not give them the golden axe. Oh no!

In pity for the noble Eagle he rushed up and soon had loosened the coiling Serpent and freed the Eagle.The Serpent was furious. He had no chance to bite the watchful Countryman. Instead he struck at the drinking horn, hanging at the Countryman's belt, and into it let fly the poison of his fangs.The Countryman now went on toward home. Becoming thirsty on the way, he filled his horn at a spring, and was about to drink. There was a sudden rush of great wings.
