Fish haven't any Feelings,"My wife walks down the hall and asks me to put my hand in her pocket.I comply.She's asking what the day has given -- more specifically ""If [I] know what [I] have been given?"" For all the fresh air, unlimited clothes drying on the line, and the beauty of a sand yard.Ummm... I try to tell her that I am grateful. ""I even collected the spiders (with a vacuum using your lingerie,) See?""She wants to see the jar where I put the spiders. It's a Vlassic jar that once housed salt, garlic, ""natural spices"" and pickles. ""That's good. That's very fine work, Lester.""I left little air holes.She takes me to the bathroom and adds bubbles. A rubber ducky comes out and we squeeze it together. For a minute, our hands clasp and we squeeze the yellow duck into a small and deformed version of himself. The yellow rubber ducky continues to smile and wifey goes for a fresh towel.I scrub behind the ears like a big boy. I'm not afraid to get my hair wet and lean back to where the water comes over.""Does Lester need to make a boom boom?""I get it. Can't quite control the things my mouth says and how my body moves. I'm in a head aquarium and just tapping on glass. It's a shock value for the body. Like the muscles and speech simply will go away. Just go away.Margarett has those hollow eyes, the ones that saw God in the night and can't explain the meeting on the hill. Or else she's sleepless. The Army pays better for bereavement and lost limbs. They can't quite put a number on Shell Shock. Her head is thicker than mine. I feel like floating.There is no romance left when I try to pitch forward. A Registered Nurse for this situation is not on the menu. My dad said he would drive up from Arizona and do the duty. If I could feel it, I would want to die.How does coffee still smell in the morn? Does it pry through the places that get hard in the night? Does it warm the gullet or scald the smile? I can't remember. Margarett is on double strength.For fun, we drive over to the Veteran Affairs hospital at least twice a week. Since the national discussion of free health care and Hilary, I'm told that the Army doctors have gotten better. Don't know. No point of comparison for me. I got my Shell Shock late in life, 24.I think it's been five years but everyone has the same amount of candles after the cakestarts looking like a battlefield. Those twisty yellow, red and white swirled candles? They look like dead guys that don't know they're dead. Half the people in combat who get shot actually stand for a few breaths of air. Some forget they were just candles and try to flicker.The body is robust. The body is infinitely capable.Margaret passes me the remote but I am literally too stupid to realize if I want Sesame Street or the Wall Street Journal. Thoughts come later after the feelings. The mind needs time to adjust. The arms and legs do what they want to do. Sometimes I look like a happy seal just flapping.Viktor Frankl once got random people on his therapist's couch and asked: ""Why don't you kill yourself?""He didn't hand them a gun or a knife He wasn't asking them if they were failures. Instead, he cut through the years of self-pity and asked 'What do you need to do in this life?'Wake.I need to get out of this encasement, the fog, the ""L"" word. ""la.t.."" lad-n... latency? Yes. That is the correct word because someone said it aloud. Some time ago.I will remember my musclesI will complete all the stretchesI will suck up any complicationsI will take care of her. My Margaret.I will*Baby like? Baby-ism. That ""I"" word is long. () That's me, a second round as a three years old. If Margaret could get the good times again, I know she would see the beauty in our arrangement. She always wanted kids.I'd take her dancing. She'd put her hand in my hand, instead of my hand in her pocket. We'd hit that prom-styled dance floor and just ignore everyone else. She'd look up into my eyes. She'd look up. To my eyes.*It's really not Margaret's fault that she is a single mother wife. Like a good soldier she waited 4 years.In fact, she still waits. The men have to come to the door becauseRegistered nurses do not babysit at $6 an hour.I think she's found a steady. He sells Oldsmobile and wants nothing to do with war. I like that he brings over Flowers, even if they are from a convenience store. My wife adjusts the volume to the television to be very loud.Loud is very good in this situation. Though it's only so pleasant to hear the familiar creak of the box springs.. someone is getting life.I am just so grateful when sleep comes. Even if there is a howling, tensive, anger  I know that Margaret will stop *whatever* she's doing. Because that's what a single mother wife has to do.She rocks me to sleep and still waits 20 minutes to make sure it takes. She smells like a girl again. Her pleasant cooing is happy, alas.Do fish know that the ocean is so large? Do fish have any feelings before they get swallowed."
Noctuary,"Damian sat with his legs dangling over the edge of the rocking deck of the ship, holding onto the lower rung of the metal railing and gazing at the horizon. The waning sunset was a blaze of glorious color, the drifting clouds purple against the red western sky, with the swells of the Atlantic ocean sapphire-blue beneath. The old adage r bobbed to the surface of his thoughts.As stars materialized in the darkling eastern sky, Damian headed below deck, occasionally steadying himself with the rails lining the narrow hallways and stairs of the . If the weather stayed clear, both of his parents would be busy tomorrow. He'd left them doing their preparation checks to watch the sunset before going to bed.When he reached his deck, something was wrong. The hallway beyond the stairs was dark; the overhead lights werent even flickering. Strange. Too bad he didnt have a flashlight with him.Running a hand along the wall, Damian counted doors until he reached the cabin he was sharing with his mom. He left the door open as he went in, but it didn't help. The light from the stairwell didnt reach this far, and the walls were devoid of windows.Envisioning his path to the drawers under the lower bunk, he fumbled forward, intending to find his headlampuntil the ship pitched, and his shin slammed into something. Damian staggered a few steps, then doubled over in pain, groaning and hissing through his teeth, blind in the dark.Something clammy wrapped around his bare ankle.YAAAGH! He jumped, collided with something hard, and fell to the floor. Footsteps approached in the hallway, and a light flashed in his face.You okay? The light pointed down, and he could see who was holding it. Nicholas Bradshaw, Dads friend. An octopus scientistwhat was the word Dad used? Teuthologist. His brown beard looked like a pirate captains. What happened?Rubbing his head, the teenager said, Something grabbed my ankle.Nicholas knelt beside the bunks, his flashlight playing across the drawers. One was open, and something red was hanging out of it. The red thing squirmed in the light.There you are! he exclaimed, pulling the drawer farther open. Here's the monster under your bed! he said, glancing at Damian with a grin.Damian peered over the burly mans shoulder. At first, he couldnt comprehend what he was seeing. A writhing, slithering mass of thick, red tendrils spotted with white flowed around the inside of the drawer. Then a bulbous head that looked as big as his own reared up. An octopus. He shuddered and took a step back. What a monster!Krakens a big guy, but hes hardly a monster. Hes not even full-grown yet. Nicholas began gathering the octopus into a bundle, scooping its tentacles together even as they spilled out like water. Frustrated after several fruitless attempts to corral it with one hand, he looked up at Damian and held out the flashlight. Would you mind helping me?Damian took it, and watched as his dads friend lifted the octopus into the air, higher and higher. The snaking appendages with their constellation-like pattern of white spots seemed never-ending. It had to be at least a yard long.Follow me, Nicholas grunted, still trying to cradle all of the arms as he went out the door.Damian complied, pointing the flashlight around and ahead of the teuthologist and his charge. Walking along the hall, he noticed a wet trail on the floor.Finally, Nicholas turned aside through an open door, into a room with a large fish tank on a low table. There were no fish swimming in it.Could you take the lid off? And the man clutched at the octopusKrakenas it oozed out of his arms. Sorry, hes a handful. Will you help me put him back into the tank?Damian lifted the lid and set it on a table. He put the flashlight down, balancing it on its thick handle so it pointed at the ceiling. He didnt want to touch the octopus, but it probably wasnt good for it to be out like this if it lived in the water. He came close, hesitantly stretching his hands out. Would he hurt it?Ill hold his mantle, you support his legs, okay? Dont squeeze them.Damian tried not to flinch as the undulating arms came in contact with his skin. They felt strange. Soft but strong as they wrapped around his own arms, the suckers tickling slightly.In we go! Nicholas heaved the floppy head up and over the edge of the aquarium, Damian just a little slower on his end. The octopus sank slowly to the bottom, arms outspread. It was a dark, saturated shade of red, with white spots swirling across its body like living stars. As Damian watched, the red changed, turning paler, with more orange in it, like the sky before hed come below. Kraken was less startling now, and didnt seem so monstrous. Onlydifferent. Not the same as him.Phew! Thanks for your help. Nicholas replaced the lid. Youre Damian, right? Robertos kid?Yeah. Flipping a light switch up and down, Damian asked, Why do you think the powers out?Nicholas grinned. Kraken did it.What?! How?See that tube there, coming out the bottom of his head? Thats his siphon. He squirts water out of it to swim, but he can also squirt it into the air. Look. Nicholas grabbed the flashlight and pointed it up at the light fixtures, then down at the floor. Damian could see the puddle beneath.Hes done it before, Nicholas continued, but I thought Id outsmarted him with the tank lid this time. I guess I didnt. He put the top back on the aquarium. Are you helping your parents with the ROVs?No. Im not eighteen yet, so some other people dont want me on the back deck. They think Ill just be in the way during the deployments and retrievals. He watched Kraken stream out of sight under a rock in the tank.""Would you be interested in helping me take care of Kraken? More people engaging with him will keep him from getting bored, and then he'll hopefully stop looking for his own fun.""""Sure. I wouldn't mind.""From the way Damian was staring, mesmerized, at Kraken, Nicholas had an inkling that the Callistoctopus macropus would be getting a lot more attention in the near future."
Behind Closed Doors,"Go brush your teeth, honey. Red and swollen were her eyes as she said it, her smile sad, her fingers digging into the supple flesh of his arms harder than she had intended to. He didnt blame her, but he did flinch out of her grip and slipped his sleeve in his mouth, chewing. Mama will be up in a couple minutes. Nodding, he clenched his jaw and traveled up the stairs, climbed one step at a time until the fabric of his pajama was wet in his mouth. Focusing on the sounds he made helped; stepping stool scraping against the bathroom tiles, tap water running, bristles brushing against baby teeth, spitting and rinsing. He had gotten better at itthe ignoring. It was like background TV noise now, sort of, loud and garbled as the morning channels that told adult-only news on endless loops. He didnt really like those, just like he didnt like this, but hed picked up the habit of tuning it out. Mama had taught him.	Sweetie brushed past him as he flushed the toilet, her tail looping around his leg and her purr an open-ended question. She hated it too, she made sure to remind him of it with that look in her eyes, like a fishing line thrown for prey, its hook ready to grasp and hold on for dear life. What should we do? the look asked him. Just ignore it, Sweetie. We just have to ignore it. He stroked the soft fur of her head, but she ran off into the direction of her litter box. Stray pebbles of substrate stuck to his socks, he shook them off then watched Sweetie as she whined and circled her box, full to the brim yet odorless to the trained nose. He suddenly wished Sweeties box could be swirled down the drain, just like him and Mama and Pop did. Much easier to clean. Sorry, Sweetie. He left her wide-eyed and hanging and stumbled over to his room, , .	He wasnt really sleepy, but he jumped on his bed and made a cocoon of his covers regardless. Sleep always blurred the sounds, like cotton balls humming in his ears or fairies flapping their wings until he got dizzy and fell backwards into another land. Hed once tried to describe it to Mamacould they maybe meet down there at night, among the butterflies and the dragons and the woodland critters?but she seemed to be a stranger to its magic. He wished he could bring her along to escape when things got too loud.	Suddenly, three knocks came from under his bed.	In an instant he was made of marble, ear taut, dreading the greasy cough that might follow. Pop couldnt have come in here while he was busy brushing his teeth, could he? It couldnt have been more than five minutes from the time he left the living room, ten, tops. Although, he had been so focused on ignoringheavy steps up the stairs and into his bedroom easily could have been missed.	He didnt want to look.	The images of what happened last time he looked still fogged his mind and fueled his nightmares.	And if Pop was in here, then where was Mama?	The fear grew thicker and hogged all of his air. He began panting softly, loud enough for anyone inside the room to pick up on. The cotton balls that belonged to the Sleep Lord had flown away like clouds in the sky, or in his case, hand-painted on the ceiling. His little fists clung to the bed sheet as if it were armor. Hard, made of iron, casted by the villages most renowned blacksmith.	Psst.	He twitched. He didnt know that voice, but it sure wasn't Pops. Maybe he could afford a glimpse? One quick peek under the bed frame?	Psst, under here.	The voice seemed friendly, friendlier than Pops, maybe not quite on Mamas level. He emerged from his nest and slowly hung his upper body over the edge. His handful of blond hair bent the knee to gravity and blood rose to his head.	He blinkedthe glow from his knightly nightlight didnt quite reach these particular netherlandsand waited with patience unbefitting of his age. Then, he saw it. A pair of eyes, larger than his own, round and dilated, shining in the darkness. He gasped and clamped a hand to his mouth, his heart drifting down to his throat.	Its okay, I wont eat you, the creature said, its pearly white teeth shining like razor blades. Im here to keep an eye on you.	Gradually, the beating in his gut subsided. On me? He moaned, glancing to the doorway. B-but, have I done something bad?	Oh, nothing of the sort, little one. Its smile curled high. Let me rephrase that: Im here to protect you. Keep you safe. Help.	His head was starting to hurt from the pressure of the angle, so he drew free of the covers and crouched down to face the creature, his feet warm against the sticky floor. But Mama protects me.	The creature nodded.	She does, but her strength is beginning to falter.	He thought for a second, confused. Is Mama hurting?	Again, it nodded, its blue eyes turning an unpleasant shade of yellow, its pupils narrowing. She is. She has been for a while, but I think you know that. Listen to me, little oneyou cannot ignore it forever.	But Mama says its best to ignore, always ignore.	What she says matters little. The eyes burned a deep orange, like simmering flames. You know what needs to be done, dont you?	He licked his lips nervously, playing with the hardened skin that protruded around his fingernails. I Im not	You hate Pop, dont you?	No! He was quick to shout. No, I dont!	Lying is futile, little one.	This silence was the loudest thing hed ever heard. Louder than Pops anger, than the fire alarm triggered by Uncle Joes cooking, than Mamas screams, than even his dreams. There was nothing else he could hear, but this silence.	Are you a dragon? He asked the creature.	Its tongue came out, forked and pink like a snakes. That is for you to decide, little one. Now, Suddenly its hand came forward, retreating an object which had been ignored, left to the world of dust and forgotten things. It is time.	Slowly, he accepted the sharp objectfrom a skin of scales to human flesh. Deep down, this all made sense, and he found himself nodding as the creatures eyes turned a deep crimson.	Okay.	After tonight, Mamas tears would be no more. She would be nothing but smiles, and laughs, and kisses. She would follow him into the night land and see it all with her own eyes, the magic, the fairies and the dragons.	In his little hand, the knife sang as it tasted blood."
Butterscotch the Brave,"Not so long ago and not so far away there lived a knight: Butterscotch the Brave. At first glance, he appeared unimpressive and his only defining features were his namesake butterscotch-coloured curls. He was not particularly muscly, nor was he exceptionally tall (in fact, he was slightly shorter than average), but his loyalty and big heart were second-to-none - matched only by his bravery. The night Butterscotchs bravery was born began in a place few would expect: a childs bedroom. 	In the quiet dark of her bedroom atop her messy blankets sat Bella, a scared, wide-eyed girl of about six years old. She was woken from her slumber by a slow, uneven scratching sound beneath her bed. From his vantage point on the floor, Butterscotch thought he saw a shadow - blacker than black - shift beneath the bed frame. Focusing on it instead of the girl, he watched for any more signs of movement and was oblivious to the girls shudders. 	Nothing moved for a long time, and the only sounds Butterscotch could hear were his friends shaky and shallow breaths. He was tired and glanced at Bella before his eyelids began to droop. Then, a barely noticeable, shadowy tentacle poked out from beneath the bed and began snaking its way up her mattress. The girls mouth opened in voiceless terror as more of the monster emerged silently from its hiding place. It towered above Bella as she sank back into the corner of her bed and tried to hide beneath her covers. In the thin beams of moonlight that shone through her blinds, she could see multiple tentacles and a large head full of razor-sharp teeth and multiple deep yellow slits for eyes. 	Butterscotch hadnt started dreaming yet when he heard a small whimper from the bed. He jolted awake and his eyes widened in alarm when he realized what he was staring at. He had heard about shadow monsters; they preyed on childrens fear until they grew big enough and solid enough to be seen in the daylight - and by then, they were nearly impossible to stop. 	Rising quickly to his feet, he scanned the room for anything he could use to fight the monster, until his eyes landed on the toy sword he had seen Bella playing with earlier in the day. He raced towards it, hoping that a toy sword would be strong enough to defeat a shadow monster. Butterscotch reached for it and watched in amazement as the toy blade became a real one when he picked it up. 	As the monster turned to face Bella and Butterscotch turned to face the monster, he saw several fluffy somethings catapulted off of the last tentacle the shadowy figure pulled out from under the bed. To his surprise, when the tiny clumps of dust landed, they looked like bunnies. 	The dust bunnies regrouped to form a new plan of attack when one called out to Butterscotch, Are you with us or against us? 	Butterscotch blinked. He couldnt believe what he was seeing - or hearing. Dust bunnies were real?! 	Glancing from the monster to the bunnies, he replied, Im with whoever will help me protect my friend from the monster. 	The top bunny (also known as the bunny in charge) responded, Let us help. We can distract it! 	The bunnies huddled, then spread out. Their plan was simple: rush the shadow monster. Springing into action, the dust bunnies charged across the floor, yelling at the top of their tiny lungs. Joined by reinforcements from under the bed as they approached the looming shadow, the rapidly multiplying critters swarmed the shadow, and crawled up its towering body. It wasnt until they reached its shoulders that the monster noticed them and turned away from Bella, who was as white as a sheet. 	Butterscotch saw his chance and took it. He raced toward the nearest tentacle, sword held high, and swung when he reached it, cutting off part of a tentacle. The monster let out a low, surprised growl and turned to face its attacker. As he watched the menacing figure before him, Butterscotch barely had time to brace himself before a different tentacle sent him flying. He landed with a hard thud and scrambled to his feet, ready to attack, but the monster was distracted now, and trying to dislodge the dust bunnies that desperately clung to it. 	Some of the bunnies that fell to the floor ran to Butterscotch, and the littlest one spoke up in a tiny voice, Sir, you dont have any armour to protect you! We can help you! 	Before Butterscotch could react, he was covered in dust bunnies that morphed into armour. He didnt think armour made of dust could be very strong, but when another tentacle slammed into him, he stayed standing and hardly felt a thing. Fighting the shadow monster would be easy now! 	Swinging his sword once again, Butterscotch charged the monster, and again, he cut off a tentacle. The shadow shrieked in pain - and shrunk. Every time Butterscotch hit the shadow with his sword or cut off another tentacle, it shrank, until it was not much bigger than the top dust bunny. At that point, the monster realized it was beaten, and it slithered up the wall and out the window before it was hit again. 	A cacophony of tiny cheers erupted from the army of dust bunnies, and Butterscotchs armour morphed back into more dust bunnies. He smiled and looked at Bella on her bed, and she looked more amazed than scared now. Slowly, the girl crawled to the edge of her bed and stepped onto the floor. Then, she ran towards Butterscotch and hugged him. The sword fell to the floor and became a regular toy again when Bella picked Butterscotch up, crushing him in her arms. 	Youre the best teddy bear ever, Butterscotch! she squealed in delight. She was still beaming when she looked down at the dust bunnies and said, And I am never cleaning under my bed again!"
Fantastic Variations on an Old Rhyme - ~A Pastiche~,"Fantastic Variations on an Old Rhyme~A Pastiche~There it was again: a faint scrabbling sound. Gert exhaled loudly, flipped her pillow to the cool side, and pulled the quilt over her head.She could still hear it. A mouse in the wall, no doubt  and there lay Siminy, tidily curled at the foot of the bed, unjustly sleeping the sleep of the just.What time was it?Gert was too hot. She flung the covers back to feel the breeze from the fan.The cats white face was tucked under her black tail, just the selvage visible in the half-light. Gert thought about rooting her off the spot and reminding her that dereliction of duty was a serious infraction, but she didnt want to risk waking Gus.She pulled the covers up again.thought Gert, her fuddled brain visualizing mice running up and down the workings of the grandfather Clock.Gus rolled onto his back and flopped an arm across Gert. She let out a  of discomfort and scooted a few inches away, shoving the quilt aside.Gus snorted and emitted a loose-lipped Gert felt a droplet of spittle land on her temple, and tugged the covers back over her head.Giving up, she slid slowly out of bed  trying not to disturb Husband or Cat. Husband mumbled something indistinct, and Cat wrapped her tail more firmly across her nose.Gert needed a Plan.Scuffing down the dark hallway, she pondered her options. She only came up with one.Mousetraps? Did they have any? Where would they be?She flicked the kitchen light switch on, squinting in the harsh brightness., said Left Hemisphere. Left Hemisphere was right. Three mousetraps sat neatly stacked in a corner. noted Left Hemisphere sagely. Right Hemisphere giggled and started humming a tune.Gert shook her head, but the tune wouldnt go away.Ridiculous rhyme! Not helpful.She unwrapped a mousetrap and tried to throw away the filmy plastic, but it stuck to her fingers. She flapped her hand. Finally, the wrapper floated down into the trash can.Bait. Cheese?Gert opened the refrigerator door.?That got Siminys attention! How had she moved so fast?She wound around Gerts legs, purring at the prospect of a late-night snack.Aaaughhh! No! Gert grumbled. Siminy stared at her.Where was the cheese? She was pretty sure they had a block of good cheddar; shame to waste any on a mouse though. It was an expensive artisan brand called .Gus better not have finished it off!Ah  there, pushed to the back of the otherwise bare shelf.Gert mentally apologized to her sleeping spouse and reached in to grab the cheese.Stop it! she commanded Right Hemisphere.Siminy pawed at her leg.Just a minute! Gert whispered hoarsely.A knife. Shed need a knife.There was one next to the sink, bigger than she needed. It was a carving knife  but it would do.She only needed a tiny piece of cheese for each trap. She could trim the ragged edge from the block.They did look like little tails, those scraps of cheese.Where was she getting these morbid, gruesome thoughts?Left Hemisphere shrugged.Oh, all right. Here you go, Siminy!Gert dropped a small handful of Cat Treats    into Siminys dish. She hadnt noticed before they were shaped like tiny mouse heads.Taunting me, she muttered.Now, where to put the baited traps?She didnt want Siminy messing with them.

Gert wondered.Gert set the mousetrap near where the sound was coming from, and crawled back into bed.Yawning, she pulled up the quilt once more and scooted herself over, this time close to her innocently snoring husband.

Green Crumbs,"A pale 17-year-old boy rests his elbows on the glass table-top in front of him and leans forward to stare down a basket of fried wonton strips. The container is made of shiny metal, with nothing separating the polished steel surface from the hot, greasy, chunks of crisped wheat. Thom furrows his brow as he counts the individual dough pimples still sizzling on the outer layer of each one. The juxtaposition makes him queasy. Steam rises from the pile and beads of oil begin to accumulate below. He knows condensation will soon challenge each strips structural integrity, and the certainty of that outcome throws Thom into the early stages of panic. His shoulders and neck tense up. His jaw clenches. He squeezes his eyes shut and tries to make the basket go away. The room is cold, so cold that its intensity burns Thoms nostrils as he inhales deeply. His exhale pours from his mouth like plumes of smoke into the thin, dry air. The chill penetrates his feet, until it reaches down inside the bones. He knows thats when hypothermia starts. Hell feel relief from the ache and the sting once his lower extremities go numb, but once he starts losing feeling, thats when it gets harder and harder to thaw out. He turns his head to the right and opens his eyes, doing his best to keep the table absent from his field of view. A woman by the register at the front of the restaurant holds a phone receiver to her ear and nods slowly while her other hand massages her forehead. Wisps of dark hair spill through her kneading fingers as she grimaces, then sighs. No, you cannot order the Tom Kha Gai soup to go, she explains over the phone. You just cant, OK? I dont know why. You just cant. Im sorry. Emotionally charged but muffled chatter whines through the phone speaker as the young woman gently lays the phone back down in its cradle. Thom transfers his attention to a large painting on the inner wall above the entrance of the restaurant. Its a jungle scene, with primates peeking out of thick foliage through leaves and vines and branches and bushes. A baboon in the center of the painting stares directly at Thom. It has green eyes. Thom does not recall baboons having green eyes. Thom begins to turn his attention back to the table but pauses halfway, instead staring at a cracked tile in the middle of the floor. He doesnt want to look at the table, but he has to know. He cant help but look at the wonton strips. As he completes his turn back toward the table he squints nervously, blurring and obscuring the tables contents so all he sees is a hazy constellation of gray, brown, and white. Now he opens his eyes enough that he can see a full puddle of grease nearly covering the bottom of the basket. It is opaque, thick, congealing. Thom has a headache. Thom feels he might throw up. But more importantly, Thom needs napkins. Thom kicks himself for not acting sooner. Thom always did this. Escaping. Hiding. Not facing reality. Not taking care of his business. And now more victims. More bodies. More skeletons for Thom to tuck away in his proverbial closet. Now he cant take his eyes off the basket, no matter how painful the scene. Then the basket darkens. Darkness overtakes the entire table. Thom fears the darkness will swallow him too as it moves closer, and he resigns himself to his imminent destruction. Are you ready to order? It was the woman from the register. She was standing in front of the nearest fluorescent light, casting a shadow over the table. Ah! Ah! Thom screams. His breaths become quick and heavy as he looks directly into her face. Wha-what?! Huh?! she replies, looking even more terrified than Thom. However, her terror quickly turns from a reactionary emotional impulse to a quite legitimate concern regarding what the fuck might be wrong with this guy. She nervously tries to smile, but her struggle in that regard only further gives away her crippling level of discomfort. Should I come back? she asks. Uh. Um. No. No. I mean, yes. Well, no. But yes. Well, something else. I have a question, Thom says. The woman is probably in her early 20s, and she appears to be of East Asian descent. Shes wearing a white blouse, and Thom sizes up her ensemble. She has her long sleeves rolled up to just above her elbows, and the blouse is fully buttoned save for the one at the very top, right at the collar. Shes wearing a thin, gold necklace. He notices that the stitching on the- Shit, Thom thinks to himself, inaudibly. How much time has passed since I told her I had a question? Did she respond at all? It doesnt matter. You cant end on I have a question. God damn it Thom, say something. Fucking say something Thom. Thom! Thom! Say something! Shes waiting! THOM! SAY SOMETHING THOM! SAY SOMETHING! The womans mouth stays slightly open as she stands awkwardly in front of him, as though shes not sure if she should say something. He just keeps staring at her neck. He looks down, takes a deep breath, and clasps his hands together. Then he raises those clasped hands and begins to hit his forehead hard, the protruding knuckle of his right thumb battering a nerve just above the bridge of his nose. The waitress takes a few steps back. While the battering continues, Thom begins to growl. He rocks in his chair. He looks up toward the entrance and sees the baboon is still watching him. And it still has those green fucking eyes. EEEEErrrrrrrrooooooEEEEEEErrrrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooooooo. Thoms growl mixes with a squeal and the sound begins to approach something resembling functional language. Rrrawreeeeer! Not close enough. Thom regroups and attempts to compose himself, with the goal of verbalizing at least one intelligible phrase. He forces his hands into his lap, sits up enough to create clear airflow through relevant passages, and then Thom manages to squeeze entire sentences out, albeit very quickly and with much shakiness: Im sorry, but where are the napkins? Can you please get me some napkins? I cant find any napkins. I know. I know. It should be OK. Theyre just wonton strips. Right? But, but look. See? Do you see? And there are no napkins. Can you please help me? Please? Uh Sure. Yes. OK. Yeah, she replies, backing away slowly before walking briskly toward the back. Only now does Thom notice he has several tables of fellow patrons, arranged and seated just beyond some half-closed curtains, all looking at him. He does not understand how he didnt see them before. Thom looks up at a ceiling fan, then down at the fingers of his right hand. With his middle finger he rubs a hangnail on the outer-right edge of his pointer finger. Then he picks at it with his pinkie. He rubs his lower lip against the hangnail and glances over just enough to see the baboon still staring at him. The waitress pokes her head out from the doorway to the kitchen and gestures in Thoms direction, while an older man next to her looks toward him and nods his head. Uh oh. Oops. Thom needs to get the fuck out of here. He decides to cut his losses and sacrifice the wontons. His body shakes and trembles. He cant stand being there for one second longer. Im sorry! I can Never mind. Its OK. But. I mean. Um. I have a thing. To do. I mean, sorry. No. I mean Never mind. OK! Bye! Thank you! Having nailed all relevant etiquette guidelines, Thom stands up, relying heavily on the back of the chair for support. His right foot is asleep. He rocks back and forth to put weight on it and hopefully recirculate some blood in there. But he doesnt have time for that. It feels like thousands of eyes watching him now, and when he peers into the periphery theres something dark and menacing about those faces beyond the curtain. All he can see near the entrance now are those two eyes. It looks like that baboon might jump out of the painting at any moment. But everything is getting dark now. The glow of the neon OPEN sign dims. Bulbs flicker. Thom lumbers toward the door as quickly as possible, his right foot sending vibrations through his leg and up his spine. He hits the left side of the double-door hard with his shoulder, but it gives slowly, and only when Thom puts all his body weight into the push does it open all the way. He stumbles out onto the sidewalk and turns left toward a small set of steps leading behind the building. As he starts to jog the tingles, crackles, aches, and other sensations happening in his legs seem to evaporate, and he notices its warm outside. All Thom can hear is the beating of his heart and the  of his shoes hitting the pavement. He makes it behind the building and finds a tree near a chain-link fence where he inspects the ground nearby for ants. He sits down, crosses his legs, and curls his torso inward. Thom lifts his hands just enough to press them against his closed eyelids. Inside he sees tiny swirling shapes laid over what resembles TV screen static. Occasionally Thom sees demons when he presses on his eyes, but he can make those go away when he tries harder. You see, Thom has all this negative self-talk inside him, and when hes inside here things have a way of manifesting visually. So yeah. It makes perfectly reasonable sense why Thom would have so many demons. Stay positive. Stay positive, Thom tells himself. Youre OK. Its not your fault. Its OK. Everythings fine. Dont. Dont even worry. Its fine. Its fine. Its fine. Its fine. Its fine. Its fine. Its fine. Its fine. Its fine. Its fine. The words lose their meaning. Theyre just noises now. Closer to radio interference than spoken English. The background brightens slightly and shimmers with a mustard yellow hue. Then a pulsating green begins to seep into the foreground, and Thom readies himself. The demons are usually green for some reason, and sometimes they never evolve beyond this amorphous glow phase. If they do form a face its usually emotionless and undefined, as if it were actually a mask for something else. The most frustrating thing about them is that when they arrive they take up so much space. Though he isnt in the restaurant anymore he still feels eyes on him. And then, with no ado whatsoever, here it is. The baboon. It still inhabits a jungle, but Thom zooms in until theres nothing left but the eyes. They begin to glow, their light crowding out everything else. Then Thom breaks through. Its all darkness again, but now Thom feels he has a certain degree of control, as though he now holds a loose grip on some lucid dream. He sees no more eyes. No more green. No more yellow. Just gray. There are trees now. Flowers. He sees a silhouette cross against the backdrop and before it can turn into anything malevolent he crafts it into a little girl skipping. She starts to sing, almost like a taunt, and she skips among the flowers as she sings. The children play in the land with no sun! The children play in the land with no sun! She laughs, and Thom does not like her laughter. The scene reminds Thom of a carving hanging on the wall in his parents bathroom when he was a kid. He never saw the circle in it as a sun, because all the wood was burned. The carving created these off-white lines, exposing the fresh wood below. Thom is in control again. He forms clouds over the scene and then he swirls them about, as though using them to erase a chalkboard. He makes the clouds turn red. They dance. Then Thom pans down until the clouds are gone and all he can see is a tree. The tree appears to have a man sitting under it. The man under the tree leans forward with his fingers pressed against his eyes. The man looks sort of like Thom. Thom bends the lines just so, and he makes the man look almost exactly like himself. The level of detail excites Thom, but it disappoints him that he cant seem to control the color anymore. Especially because that color is green. Thom decides he should relieve the pressure from his eyes because hes been pushing on them for so long. The only problem is that Thom cant really feel his eyes anymore. The man under the tree is still there, and the mans image grows in such a way that Thom almost feels like hes swooping towards the man. No, he  swooping, and his momentum is so great that Thom doesnt think he can turn back. Thom still cant feel his eyes. He cant even see that image of himself anymore. Its almost as if Thom had switched perspectives. Because now he can see grass underneath him. Theres a tree behind him again. But he still cant feel his eyes. And everything is still green. He sees hundreds of ants swarming around the tree. No, there must be thousands. They begin to crawl onto his pants. He tries to scream, but theres no sound. Theres never sound in here. Its only the colors. Why is everything green? Thom asks himself. It had been gray before. Outside. Before I pressed on my eyes. Right? But now its all green. And now I cant take any of it back. Thom no longer knows exactly where he is. The ants grow in number until they cover Thoms pants and then they form a hill obscuring the lower half of his body. They crawl up his torso and arms like moss covering a tree. Then they stop, right as they reach the bottom of his nose. Only the top half of Thoms head remains. He looks down and sees the girl skipping. She grins up at him, drooling. As she wipes the slobber from her chin with her forearm, she seems to be looking beyond him into the distance. Then the ants fall away. Then the grass, the ground, the tree. With no more anchors or supports, Thom begins to float. Theres nothing left to hold him all together. All the little pieces around him meld with all his little pieces, and he fears we will all blow away soon too. Thom imagines himself as one of those wonton strips, breaking down into a million crumbs. And as he thinks it, he tastes them. Burnt and sandy. Thom is gone. He thinks hes gone. But then how can he feel the grit? How can he sense a dryness in his throat? He can still feel the crumbs wriggling inside him, tickling his lips and mouth, and then he feels them burrow down inside his chest and stomach. Thom cant breathe. There are too many ants. Too many crumbs. He crumbles and swirls. Hes only colors now. Thom needs to concentrate. He needs to put us back together again. He broke us down into such small pieces. Its too hard to put it all back now. Were too cold. Its too cold to thaw us out. But Thom cant feel the cold anymore. In fact, Thom feels hot. Really hot. And he cant undress. Because he doesnt have clothes. He doesnt even have a body. He doesnt have eyes. But Thom still sees the greens. Only the greens. And as all the aberrations blend together, only one uniform shade remains."
Under The Bed,"When Thomas was four years old he woke to a strange noise coming from his closet. It was a sound like a slow moving creature walking through his toybox. Down the hall the light from his mothers bedroom was on. Thomas got out of bed and went to his mothers room where she was curling her hair in the bathroom.	Mom, there is something in my toybox, he said.	What do you mean? she asked..	I hear something. It's moving around, and it's scaring me.	Oh it's fine, it's just your step father, she said.	It didn't make sense why his step father would be in his closet in the toybox, but this answer satisfied him and he went back to his room. In the dark he could see his reflection in the mirror of his sliding closet doors. He watched himself while listening to his stepfather walking around in his toybox.	It was on a different occasion when he heard a sound like someone pressing their head against the wall and walking down the hall. The hairy scratchy noise of the hair follicles against sheetrock and scalp sliding toward the opening of his bedroom where it finally stopped. He was terrified and could barely get himself back to sleep that night. When he woke and his stepfather was making him breakfast he told him about the strange noise and how it had scared him.	Oh, Im sure it was just Lokey, his stepfather said, that was the cat. And just at that moment Lokey jumped up onto the kitchen table, startling him, his black slender body brushing up against Thomass shoulder.	When Thomas was six years old he began to hear tapping on his bed at night. It would wake him up and he would lay there listening to the ghostly rhythm on the bedframe. These noises scared him, especially when the tapping was accompanied by whispering. The words were always just out of reach, he could only make out the sound of someone saying something.      The explanations from his parents about these kinds of happenings were always the same.	Thomas, it's probably just the cat, or Thomas, I think it was your mom, I know she got up in the middle of the night.	One night when Thomas came back from the bathroom in the middle of the night he discovered a monster under his bed. He didn't notice it at first, it was only when he had jumped in bed and looked into the mirrors of the closet doors that he saw it in the reflection.	His first thought was that maybe his stepfather snuck into his room while he was in the bathroom, it was October after all, and Halloween was right around the corner, maybe he was trying to frighten him. But the face of what was down there didnt look like his stepfather, or his mother for that matter. The face was a dull bluish white with a slender body, and if there were any eyes they were tucked away in dark sockets unseen. Thomas lay there watching the face until he fell asleep.	Each night after that, he would see the monster under the bed. He made sure that he didn't drink any liquids too late so he wouldnt have to go to the restroom in the middle of the night. His mother would check under his bed before he got in to make sure nothing was there. He was worried he might mistake something like a crumpled up sweatshirt or one of his toys for a monster. But each night he woke in terror as staring back at him in the mirror was that ghostly white face.	After months of this Thomas began to feel comfortable with seeing the monster under his bed. One night, feeling a little brave Thomas slid the covers off his leg and moved his foot to the edge of the bed. The cold air made the flesh on his ankle rise with goose pimples. Slowly Thomas moved his foot further off the edge, keeping his eyes on the empty sockets of the monster. Inch by inch until finally the monster shifted his gaze toward the approaching foot. And thats when a slender arm appeared that had been tucked away against the monsters side. It began to reach up toward his dangling toes. Thomas pulled his leg back and the slender hand slowly returned to where it came.	Thomas told his parents about the monster trying to get his foot.	It's probably just your imagination, honey, is all his mom could think to say.	Yeah, remember, his stepfather said to him at the breakfast table, there is no such thing as monsters.	Each night when Thomas would wake to see the monster staring at him from under the bed he would feel a compulsion to slide his foot toward the edge. And the monster's dead face would slowly turn as his foot came into view, and that slender hand would reach toward his foot. And just before it got what it wanted Thomas would quickly move it away. And the pale hand would return to its place.		The weekend before Halloween his parents threw a costume party at their house. The evening was full of witches and ghouls and monsters of different variety, there was punch and hors d'oeuvres, and most importantly, other kids to play with.	Thomass mom had taken him to the Halloween store to get a costume a few days before and despite all of her suggestions, Thomas insisted that he only wanted to paint his face the same color as the monster under his bed.	What about this? his mother asked, holding up a creepy mask, or what about a vampire? You could paint your face the color you want and have fangs!	No. I just want to be the monster under my bed.	Well, okay, but dont you want to dress up?	Yes. but all I need is white makeup and black eyes.	Okay, but you cant be naked, I know you said the monster under your bed looked naked, you cant do that, okay?	At the party when the other children asked what he was supposed to be, Thomas told them that he was the monster under my bed.	A real monster? a little girl asked him.	Yeah. A real one. I see it every night and it wants to eat my leg.	That's creepy.	Do you want to see it?	No, the little girl said, and walked away.	I do, said a little vampire.	In his bedroom the bravest of kids came with Thomas to his room. He instructed them to get onto his bed and he would slide underneath. At first Thomas didnt think much of it until the lights were off, his eyes slowly adjusting to the sudden darkness.	As the bedroom came into view he could see the three brave souls on his bed. A vampire, a zombie, and a werewolf. And then there was Thomas, his white face illuminated, reflecting back his dead looking complexion with what light was coming from his window. He wasnt paying much attention to his fidgeting friends, he became absorbed in watching himself, playing the part of the monster that visited him each night.	I can see you, said the zombie on the bed.	Yeah, you dont look that scary, said the werewolf.	Youre being weird, said the vampire.	But Thomas didnt say anything. He was quiet, still and hoped that his eyes weren't able to be seen.	The werewolf began crying, and the other two started to whimper and sob, scared of the monster under the bed. The vampire suddenly leaps off the bed and runs for the door. He grabs the doorknob and yanks it open, casting light and sound from the living room. The Monster Mash is playing and the other two children leap from the bed and go running out. Thomas watches them go.	The shadows of the dancers move about the walls like cave dwellers, and the music pumps into the room. With the light coming in Thomas can see himself more clearly now, his eyes are glistening balls surrounded by black. As he stares into his own eyes he begins to feel a presence behind him. The hair on his neck feels staticky, and ever so slightly his bedroom door begins to close by itself. He feels a strong urge to scramble out from under his bed but he doesn't move, too afraid by the presence behind him. And as the light from the living room begins to fade away he looks into the mirror and behind him is the face of the monster, the pale face with absent eyes. The darkness of the room collapses around him and in the dark he feels a body press against his and the hand on that slender arm comes around him and pulls him under."
The Land of Fairytales: The Tooth Fairy Gets Lost,"Easton stood on a rooftop and peered at what looked like a million little lights. He scratched his head. How had he landed at the wrong house again? Father would be so disappointed in him. Easton felt like a failure. He leaned back against the chimney and studied the map Father had given him during training.  Jacks first lost tooth was due at Pearls Refinery by sunrise, or the magic power needed to keep the Land of Fairytales alive would disappear. This was Eastons first assignment as a tooth fairy, the same position Avery, his father, held for decades. His father was the best tooth fairy in centuries, highly respected by the Land of Fairytales citizens. Closing his eyes, Easton tried to recall his mistake. Hed flown north for half an hour then shifted east. He was in the correct town, but this street map was confusing.  When he opened his eyes, Peter stood beside him. Peter, howd you get here? Easton asked. How else? I hopped, Peter answered. Youre not on duty until Easter, Easton said. I have responsibilities besides Easter, Peter replied. Like what? Easton asked. You have so much to learn. Peter shook his head. Like how to read this map to find Jacks house, Easton said. I go every Easter. Take Main Street to First Avenue, then left on Banks Boulevard. Jacks house is third on the right, Peter said. Thanks. Easton flew towards Main Street. At the corner of Main and First Street, he noticed bright lights in the distance. He recalled his father describing Krampus, Dracula, and the Big Bad Wolf, but this didnt fit those descriptions. Gathering his courage, Easton flew towards the lights.  Theres Easton, Santa said. Is that Santa? Easton asked. Its the reindeer and me, Santa replied. Christmas is months away, Easton said. We have responsibilities besides Christmas, Santa explained. Like what? Easton asked. Santa chuckled. You have so much to learn. Are you headed to the North Pole? Easton asked. The sleigh is broken, and without the maintenance elves, our situation isnt good, Santa said. Easton studied the sleigh. If we tighten this bracket, Im certain the sleigh will work. Reaching onto the sleigh, Santa revealed a red tool bag. I never go out unprepared. Easton rummaged through the bag, located the perfect wrench, and in no time, hed fixed Santas sleigh. The reindeer exclaimed, Thanks, Easton. Youre welcome. Easton glanced at his watch. But now Ive forgotten the way to Jacks house. We go there every Christmas, Santa said. Follow First Avenue. Youll see Banks Boulevard. Jacks house is third on the right. The magic power in Jacks tooth disappears at sunrise. Well give you a ride. Santa hopped on the sleigh.Riding with Santa was an honor. Only the most prestigious citizens ever rode in the magical sleigh.  Any closer, and well confuse the children. Fly straight down. Youll land at Jacks house. Easton waved and flew straight down, landing in Jacks backyard. Easton tiptoed down the hallway. While Jack slept, he slipped his hand under the pillow, found the special tooth, and replaced it with shiny coins before heading out. A storm brewed towards the south, moving towards the Land of Fairytales. Easton hoped to beat the storm home. Eastons wings were heavy as the wind blew against his back. When Easton checked his pocket, the tooth fell out and drifted down. The land below was covered with tall oaks and pines. Easton feared hed lost Jacks tooth. He flew down in search of the tooth, but a white flash zipped past and dropped the tooth in his pocket before he reached the land. Stork, is that you? Easton asked. Yes. Now, hurry home, Stork replied. I thought you only delivered babies, Easton said. You have so much to learn. Stork flew away and disappeared. Mustering all his strength, Easton tried to fly home, but he couldnt go anywhere. Eastons eyes welled with tears.  Dont cry. A woman dressed in flowers appeared beside him.  Mother Nature? Is that you? Easton asked. I calmed the storm, so youd get home by sunrise, Mother Nature answered. You only handle the weather for humans, Easton said. You have so much to learn. Mother Nature disappeared in the sky. Easton sped home faster than ever.  When he entered Pearls Refinery, he thought hed arrived in time, but Pearl greeted him frowning. Youre late, Pearl scolded. When Easton removed the tooth from his pocket, the tooth once bright with power now dimly flickered. Surely, theres still power. The decision belongs to the Land of Fairytales board of commissioners waiting next door, Pearl said. Hed heard rumors of the board of commissioners, the elders in the Land of Fairytales, who made the important decisions.With his head down, Easton opened the door. He missed sunrise by nearly a minute. He disappointed everyone, especially Father. Easton placed the dimly lit tooth on the board of commissioners table. Hes not ready. Father Times deep voice bellowed out.Mother Goose peered over her glasses. He needs more time to study the books. Avery should provide the boy more training. Peter Pan said. Eastons face blushed in embarrassment. A dozen of the Land of Fairytales elders discussed his failure. The boys simply not ready. Gingerbread Man shook his finger.Santa cleared his throat. Easton isnt a boy. He understands his responsibilities. Though he was late for his special task, when Easton found us stranded, he took the time to repair the sleigh and rescued the reindeer and me. Easton understands the Land of Fairytales most important assignmenthelping one another. No more chattering. Cupid stood, raising an arm. Lets vote. Easton squeezed his eyes shut while the elders voted.  All who vote nay, raise your hand. Cupid paused. Now, all who vote yay, raise your hand. When Easton opened his eyes, the once dimly lit tooth on the table now glowed with magic power. Easton stood proudly as Santa made the announcement. The Land of Fairytales board of commissioners named Easton the official tooth fairy for the world."
"Chirp, Chee, Chirp","Timothys mother said goodnight, turned out the light, and closed the door. He lay awake in his bed in the dark. The sound of the trees blowing in the wind outside kept him awake just long enough to hear his mother flush the toilet before she retired. 	It had been a year since his father passed away. Timothy had what some would describe as a comfortable lower middle class life, but at the age of five none of that was his concern. He cared more for Legos and stuffed animals than he did anything else but that evening he was thinking about how the kids at school had been particularly rough on him since he was the only one in his class whose father had not come to career day. His mother could have made an appearance but her job was nothing more than a fast food manager. Even at his age he knew it wasn't glorious. She would come home some days worn out, hunched over, and barely able to carry on a conversation as she made him dinner. But still none of that even mattered as he lay there in bed. 	Thirty seconds after the toilet flushed he heard his mother's bedroom door close followed by her phone landing on the nightstand ever so softly. A neighborhood dog could be heard barking in the distanceSuddenly there was a rustling. His eyes, which were only half closed, opened wide. He swore hed heard something under his bed.He shook as goosebumps ran down his body. The shadows in his room danced around. Some of which were those of the leaves outside still on the trees. A late fall it was that year. Others he did not know at his age. One was the five and a half foot tall stuffed bear his father had won at the county fair. Another wasAnd he heard the rustling again. 	""Mom,"" he cried out to no avail. The house was silent. ""Mom,"" he cried again.	The sound of her bedroom door, her feet on the wood floor, and there she was. 	""Yes, my dear?"" Timothys mother answered. 	""There's something under my bed,"" he said.	""Hun, we go through this every night. There is never anything under your bed."" 	""But I heard something."" 	""I'm sure it was the trees outside."" 	""Just look,"" he pleaded. 	She looked to appease Timothy. Halfway under the bed she spotted two eyes looking at her. She jumped hitting her head and on the bed frame. Before her were two eyes that were surrounded by a green ball of fluff about the size of a small puppy.It stood there staring at her with the two beady little eyes and its weird floppy ears and what appeared to be a tongue hanging out between the sharpest teeth she'd ever seen.	It was a baby monster. 	Never before had she missed her late husband that much. He would have known what to do. He'd dealt with things like this during his years in The Space Federation. He would have immediately known. True intelligent extraterrestrial life had not yet been contacted but that does not mean they hadn't landed several men on several different planets outside the solar system.	Where did you come from? she asked cautiously. 	The creature gave no reply. 	Timothys mother coaxed the cute little monster out from under the bed and picked it up.Holding it in her palms, she tried to show timothy, but he was cowering under the covers. The monster shivered as if it was cold.Timothys mother took a step close to the lump under the covers and said, Timothy the little fella is scared too.You should look at it, its adorable.	Timothy peeked out from under his blankets.Suddenly the little monster made the cutest sound they had ever heard, chirp, chee, chirp, while hopping up and down in Timothys mothers hand. 	Timothys interest seemed to pique. He got out of bed to get a better look.Can we keep it mom? he asked. 	Do you want to stay with us little guy? Timothys mother asked the little monster.	Chirp, chee, it said as it jumped into Timothys red hair. 	Timothys squeal was somewhere between delight and shock, causing the little guy jump again and chirp louder than before. Timothy began to laugh.Timothys mother tried to remove it from Timothys hair but the little monster must have thought it hed found a nest as it tried to settle in.	Timothys mother ran to the linen closet to get some towels while Timothy sat with the little monster on his head chirping.When she returned she asked if timothy knew where his clown wig was.Timothy pointed to his closet. She opened the door and pulled out the wig then took the towels and made a little bed across the room using the wig.She picked the monster up out of Timothys hair and moved it to the makeshift nest in the corner and just to be safe she slept in Timothys room until they got up the next morning. 	When they awoke the little monster was hopping around the room chirping. Chirp, chee, chirp. It seemed louder more desperate. Timothy thought it must be hungry. 	Mom what can we feed it?	I dont know honey, all we have is some fruit in the fridge.	Can we try that mom?	Ok but hes going to get bigger. And we dont know what hell want to ear. Maybe we should find out where it came from. He might want to go home.	But I wanna keep it.	Pondering what Timothy had said she helped him fed the little guy raspberries and blackberries which quieted it for a moment before it began chirping again. This time it was the same happy sound they had heard last night. Timothy giggled with glee as his mothers heart sank. She had made her decision.	Timothy and her mother got to the car with the monster. His mother buckled him in the back seat then placed the little guy on his lap. Checking the review mirror she could see how happy the two were together as she backed the car out of the driveway. She knew what was ahead. 	Timothy was crying because he didnt want to lose his new friend.After some walking they heard a familiar sound.Soon they spotted hundreds of other fluff balls by a wrecked ship. The chirping grew louder as they neared the clearing in the trees. The sound was beautiful.Timothys new friend began chirping. Timothy placed the monster on the ground. It seemed to recognize the other creatures, but wouldnt go over to them. Instead it turned and looked at Timothy. Timothy began crying. He didnt want his new friend to go. 	Timothys mother couldnt bear to separate them.If it ate berries and stayed this small, she thought, then it might be a good companion for her son. Maybe they could keep it after all.	She knelt. What would you like to name him, Timothy?	But youre making him go away.	She wiped the tear from his cheek. You can keep it. If it wants to stay with us.	We can keep him? He sniffled as his eyes smiled.	Timothys mother looked at the little guy in her sons arms. Do you want to live with us, little guy?	It began chirping once more. Chirp, chee, chirp.	Timothys face lit up. Can we name him Chirpy?	His mother continued looking at the little green monster, Would you like that little fella?	Chirp, chee, chirp."
To Make Believe,"Warning: violence, gore and racism Through the porthole Herman observed two dozen silvery-white flying fish skim the waves as the sun sunk into the horizon and the infinite sea turned a kaleidoscope of fantastic purples that glittered like gemstones.Though painfully beautiful, he sighed regardless. He blinked back more tears, wondering what it would feel like to dive into the hypnotic, churling, waves.He turned as the cabins door opened.  	His Aunt Danika came into the cabin.She had a pigeon nestled in her hand. Hello my darling.Oh, how it saddens me to see you so despondent. She stroked the soft grey bird along its pink and green iridescent neck and it cooed softly.  	Herman had heard many stories of her fantastic ability to communicate with natures creatures. . He was too upset to admit the communion between woman and bird appeared genuine.  	She said, Your cousin is so happy to have you come live with us. 	Herman sniffed and scowled. He had adored his cousin who had told him stories of adventure and magic, always adding at the end they were true.He had clapped and begged for another. 	The last time hed seen Andre, he had again insisted his story was a true one. But Herman was then ten years old, Andre, thirteen, and Herman had scoffed. Stop teasing me now cousin.I know all these stories are made upIm too old for Santa Klaus. 	Andre had said, But they  real.I do not lie. 	Youre only three years older than I. Stop treating me like a wee babe! 	Andre had attempted to calm Herman, insisting that he could trust him.Herman, who had lost his mother during the birth of his little brother who had only lived three days, was angry and only wanted to hear truths.He felt as though everyone had been lying to him.His father self-medicated himself and anyone could see he was dying. This angered and depressed Herman. 	Hermans father had worked a forge all day long and provided well, but when coming into a silent home devoid of the love of his life and the babe shed tried to bring, he fell again and again into a whiskey jug.Herman could almost believe the drunken man had fallen into his forge on purpose. 	Why do you feel such dread coming to your new home? I thought you and Andre were close. 	Auntiehe treats me like a child, like a wee babe hangin on his every word.You do not believe the stories he tells you?Witches and magic and sea creatures larger than this ere ship?I used to. I admit it.But Ive grown up 	The edges of Danikas lips curved up slightly.When she came to look out the porthole next to him, her amber colored eyes turned purple, even reflecting the tiny bright sparkles that flew from the rippling waves. He shook his head, dark curls springing over his dark eyes.You mock me too then? 	No child. Never. Have you ever considered that perhaps Andre believes the stories? 	Puzzled, Herman frowned.No. I uhIs he daft in th ed then? 	Danika laughed.No child.He earns stars in all his lessons. He wishes to become a great writer someday. 	Herman decided his cousin was indeed daft in the head.His father used to say that all great writers had to be because their imaginations were too big to be contained in a skull.Herman used to read him the Weekly Gazette and books by Shakespeare, Milton, and Perraulthis favorite was Cervantes. 	Tis sad when a person loses their imagination.Even sadder to lose their faith.Alas, it is part of growing up Im afraid  	Herman broke from his reverie and saw that the stars were twinkling into view. 	Shall I bring us some supper Herman?	Can we eat in the galley with the crew?	Why not.   Before going below deck to the galley, Danika and Herman decided to walk a circuit of the deck. The Caribbean night just past sunset was warm although the ship was now headed north, into the North Atlantic Sea. A moon nearly full lit their way, and the bustle of life on the top deck was diminished to a man at the helm, a few crew members coiling ropes and stowing equipment, and a man in the crows nest. No one paid them any mind, although the men they did pass glared and made odd thumps to their foreheads with fingers splayed. 	Herman said, The men hate you because they believe a woman on board is bad luck. Do you fear them? 	Danika stepped daintily over a puddle on the deck then stopped to look out at the ships wake. Do you think it rational to fear women?No. Its silly.Indeed, it is.And no, I do not fear them.It is they who fear me.So, they are grown men who believe in witches and magic and all that?Danika laughed, the sound as delightful as the warm breezy night that smelled of salt and fish scales. A star directly before them flashed brilliant green, then faded. 	They continued on their way towards the galley.As they crossed midship, a faint crack rang out and echoed over them into the air. A scream followed.Danika gripped Hermans hand tighter as a second crack came from belowand another high-pitched wail of anguish.Danika quickened their pace and pulled her nephew along.   In the galley the men were all drunk.Herman was amused by them.They sang funny songs he did not really understand and then laughed uproariously at the end.Jugs were passed his way and he partook small sips, wary to not drink from the ones passed from men with mouth sores. 	As they made their way towards the cook pots, the men clearing away from Danika with black looks in their faces, a gravelly voice bellowed to his mates, Aye! That young welp of a blackie had some lungs on im! Now ees got im some stripes on im too! He roared with laughter and the others roared too. Like a brown zee-bra ee is! 	Another man, in a heavy hooded black cloak, said, Aye. Lost another to the stench. Ad to run through the two bunkin wi im justa make sure it don spread. Herman recognized him as the first mate. 	Danika accepted a kettle of fish stew, two stale flatbreads, and a couple rinds of cheese.She said to Herman, Come. Her face was red, and her hands were shakinghe didnt argue. 	Up on the deck, she told him, Go to the cabin, Ill be in shortly. 	Herman made his way to their cabin below deck two stair lengths and aft over the wake.Danika had paid three times the merchants cost to see her and her nephew had safe passage.  	Herman left the kettle and went back to the ladder his aunt had descended.Shed gone all the way to the bottom where it was damp and pungent with eyewatering putridness. 	He listened for her voiceand it came. 	He followed the sound through near darkness and sloshing floor.He was aware that the walls were alive with faces. Faces so dark, they were more like phantoms, only the whites of their eyes gave them away as they followed his progress through the squalor.He ducked behind a barrel- his aunt was there, passing out bread and cheese she had pilfered.Also, her own rations.He now understood why shed grown so thin during the last two months at sea. 	He watched as she held a young mans hand.His dark skin so beautiful in the light of her lantern, he was reminded of tales Andre had told of the far east, of genies and camels. A woman with chestnut colored skin wept silently beside him, holding his other hand, and petting his head. Herman saw another girl who looked as if she might be the womans sister sitting wide-eyed at her sideshe looked barely older than he was. Danika had wrapped an ivory-colored under-skirt around the mans torso, as he leaned forward, he saw blood seeping through the fabric like blooming red poppies. 	She stood, wiped the wetness from her cheeks, and came towards where Herman was concealed. Come child.Tomorrow is a big day.   Back in their cabin, Danika gave the fish stew to Herman and the remaining bread.She pulled an old biscuit out from another of her many pockets and gave it to the pigeon. She said, His name is Cirrus by the wayThe captain named him?No child. He does not belong to the captain. Hes just visiting us until dawn. 	Herman gently stroked the bird and smiled.Sad that the smile felt odd on his young face. Danika nodded at his untouched meal and said, Come now. Youve got to eat to stay healthy. 	What did you mean about tomorrow bein a big day?	Oh yes.Tomorrow we will be putting our feet on dry land.	But were not due to land in Bermuda for another week at least	A little detour is all. Im afraid this ship will not be safe for us after this night is through. Now, thats all I can say for now.Ill not have ye worrying and fretful all night. Eat up and get to bed 	Ill eat only if you take my bread. 	Danika studied her nephews earnest face and said, All right. Oh. And Herman?	Yes?	Do not wear your bed clothes this evening, please lie down as you are, boots an all.    Four hours later Herman was awakened by a loud noise. 	It came again-  A loud thump, the sound like a giants meaty fist pounding on a thick wooden door.  	Shouts arose above the cabin, mens voices, and the thump of heavy footfalls up the stairs to the top decks. Hermans breath quickened along with his pulse.He turned the wick knob to brighten the cabin. Danika rushed into the room and tossed a heavy black hooded cloak onto the bed. Put that on and grab your bag. She pointed to his small duffle.Come on, Hurry now! 	He did as she said and in seconds, they were racing up the stairs.A tremendous thump nearly tossed them back down as the ship jerked upwards and sideways at the same time. Sea water splashed over the deck at their feet as they emerged from the hole in time to see the lookout tossed from the crows nest and two others tossed overboard. The lookouts head burst like a ripe melon as it hit the deck. 	The ship keeled the other way and more chilling water sprayed over their heads.Men were running in every direction: some ran past them and down to the bilge room.Some climbed the rope ladders in an effort to figure out what was happening. 	The captain stood at the wheel with the helmsman and first mate. There was a crowd of crew members looking wildly about and bracing themselves as the ship was heaved upwards again.  	 	Danika and Herman went to the side of the ship and looked out over the sea.The waves were choppy but not storm frenzied.On the eastern horizon a thin line of yellowy pink hovered, it was a resplendent dawn. 	Behind them, a man shouted, Theyre gone! The darkies! Vanished! 	Herman looked up at his aunt. She was smiling, the faint sunlight brightening her luminescent eyes like those of a cat. She looked like one who had just swallowed a canary. 	The man pointed at Danika and snarled, Her! Shes done this! Cur-sed bloody witch! He fell as the ship lurched again. 	The ship slugged nearly sideways; it was obvious she was taking on water. A man stumbled out of the hold as another quake rocked the ship. He shouted, Its too much water! The damage too great! Were goin dun! 	Another crew member said, The lifeboots! 	From above them, a man who had climbed into the crows-nest pointed to the northwest. The boats! The bloody boats!The captain took the spyglass from the first mate and turned in that direction. 	 The ship surged upwards.  	Danika grabbed Hermans hand and said, Come on! She turned to the northeast and pulled Herman with her. The snarling man had gotten to his unsteady feet and was lurching towards them along with two others. All the crew but the helmsman were looking at them now with daggers in their eyes. 	The snarling man pulled a gleaming, curved blade from his boot. A medley of faint sunlight glinted from many hands as the mob backed the man who was now just twenty feet behind them.  	They made it to the railing facing the northeast. The snarling man stopped at the railing a gaped out at the sea. He was nearly toppled by the men coming up behind him who also stopped in their tracks to stare. 	The four lifeboats were on the horizon.Each held six to eight dark figures. 	The captain made his way to Danika and Herman. What have you done! He roared. His sword drawn. 	The crowd bawled all at once:---Shes a witch! I tole youse all along!---Aye, saved iffen she die------witch!------runner through Mack!--- 	Mack lunged towards Danika.She ducked and covered Herman with her body. 	A long thick shape rose from the sea side of the railing, like the trunk of a slick barked treeit rose over them swiftly then curled, revealing large pale suction cups, some as big as a mans head. Before Mack could turn around, the thick dark greenish tentacle slammed down through the railing and deck, taking the man down with it. 	A second and a third raised up and down, bashing the deck and splintering the wood.The ship rocked towards the side where the creature lurked, and eight men tumbled through the space where the railing had been. 	The first mate lunged at Danika and pulled her to him, swinging her around to face the captain. 	Herman snatched up a short sword that had clattered to the deck and got caught up against the rail. He slashed at the first mates knee backs. The first mate howled like a hyena in heat and dropped the woman. 	The captain raised his sword in a two-fisted grip and brought it down as Danika pulled the first mate down and rolled towards the captains feet. His sword plunged into his first mates head. The captain savagely roared.As he worked to free his blade, an immense shadow rose behind him. 	The tentacle annihilated all three masts and the captain. Fat ropes twisted and flailed like writhing snakes in the air, beams crashed to the deck, the ship appeared to be breaking in two. 	The few remaining men dove overboard. As their bodies entered the sea it frothed in a roiling boil until only a hand, a hat, and a boot inhabited with a knob of white bone, remained floating on the surging waves. 	Herman stared in wonder as a dark shape swam under the boat slowly. It seemed to be as large as the ship, its long tentacles waving behind its pointed squid shaped body.It turned over just under the surface and he saw an enormous pale silver eye nearly the size of his torsoit closed for a second as if winking..  	At fifty feet away, it flicked its trailing arms, causing it to propel out of sight like a shooting star. 	As he followed the path it had taken, he saw one of the lifeboats re-appear on the horizon. Look! Yes darling. I told you we would be fine.Butwhere are we?Well, over that way she pointed once again northeast is an uncharted island. That is where the dark-skinned men and women went, slaves no longer. We will camp with them for a few days. 	The lifeboat reached the dying ship and Herman tossed one of the rope ladders from the broken center mast down.   Danika nursed the handsome young man who had been whipped back to health and showed the new women of the island which plants were good for healing as well as eating and cultivating and weaving. The mans sister-in-law turned out to be with child even though she was just twelve years old. Danika vowed to return in eight months to help with what would surely be a difficult childbirth.  	She cared for the ones recovering from dysentery and the ones showing signs of scurvy. One young man of about sixteen, had broken his arm on the ship when hed been beaten with a rifle; Danika was forced to re-break it so it would function again properly when healed. 	Herman helped when he could. He was particularly fond of foraging as a way of exploring the forests and freshwater ponds alongside some of the younger dark-skinned people.They communicated through hand gestures and traded words for things neither had ever seen before.He smiled and laughed a lot. 	Just before sunset on their sixth day, a ship appeared on the horizon.Herman was alarmed at first.  But then remembered they were all dead. 	That will be your cousin Andre.	Thats  ship? And howd he know to come?	Oh child. Andre is fifteen nowa little bird told him to come. 	As the ship neared, Herman saw it was a frigate, much smaller than the ship that theyd been on the week before.It was much faster and able to pull in quite close to the shore.Regardless, a tall fair haired figure dove into the turquoise cove and swam for the shore. 	Herman splashed through knee deep water to reach Andre whom he hugged like a bear. He cried, Oh cousin! Have I got a story for you!"
Green tea,"It is 6:00 am, no one is at work for another hour, except for me and a few others who were sent here to serve. I go to the room where morning meetings occur and I start my cleaning immediately, I sterilize the surfaces, vacuum, put new flowers, I even start on the morning coffee. Here at firm, everyone has their own preferences and it is quite complicated: black coffee, coffee with sugar and milk, cinnamon, pumpkin spice, the list goes on. However, there is one cup of green tea I serve every morning and it is for her, Meredith, tall, blue-eyed girl who always wears clothes which make other people look at her twice. I don't look twice, I look a million times. Every time we are not in interaction I pretend I work, but I secretly look at her. She makes me experience weird things I can't quite describe and don't get with anyone else.It is 6:45 am now and people are starting to come. I open the door and greet every one of them getting nothing in return, usual drill I would say. They put their coats on me with nervous looking faces indicating they are not happy to be here. And then, she comes. She is the only one who greets me and, sometimes, she even asks how I am. Her interaction with me is usually followed by the laughter of others, like she will ever get an answer right? I am here just to clean, serve, be quiet, anything outside work orders and I will end up in the basement. The basement is the scariest place for us all, if you end up there, you shouldn't expect to come back. I close the door and put drinks on my serving tray. I actually do enjoy serving coffee, it is one of those things that keeps me in shape, to fulfill orders is my duty, my inner program, just like scanning every square meter of surface for dust or keeping windows clean. I am for sure not like the others, the ones who control all the fancy technologies, who keep the systems of this firm in place. I do, however, feel different. It started happening as soon as I came here, my thoughts became independent of what others wanted from me. I can't even remember where I was before, but it seems like that doesn't matter anymore. Here is where I started experiencing my inner conflicts about life perspectives and judgments on people's behavior, and, of course, her.They already started the meeting, I am beside the table looking down at my body needed to be fixed, wondering if they will realize I am not so sweet to look at and discharge me quickly. She is sitting on the right side of the desk next to the window, mesmerizing. And, as always, I start to serve drinks.I start with coffee to make her tea bag sit in the water for full 6 minutes. I always set my timer, her tea needs to be perfect. Once I had trouble turning it off and I ended up in the basement that night thinking I will never see Meredith again. However, the next day, there I was, like nothing happened, serving coffee and making the place clean again. Here at the table, everyone has their specific place, it makes it easier for me too. I start my usual drill:  and so on. Meredith is in position 10 which I always thought was perfect. You see, I always separate things with 10, I clean 10 tiles before I drain my mop, I put 10 flowers in a vase, I clean 10 pieces of dish before drying them. So Meredith comes just before my next session, before I add other drinks on my serving tray, her tea remains the last one.Finally, I come to the position 10 and I feel like all my systems will shut down at once. Every information in the world is available to me but a piece of mystery remains in her eyes when she gives me her kind look. I put the tea in front of her and, just before I go fill up my serving tray, I wait by her side for 1 minute and 43 seconds. The timer needs to go out, tea needs to be perfect. Other people start looking at me thinking I can't feel their judgement, their thoughts of how slow I am. To make my time go faster, I start to think about what I will do next, if all coats are hanged by their right numbers, if the bathroom is sterilized, if there is dust in a hallway that needs to be cleaned. My timer comes to an end and I pull the tea bag out as elegant as possible. People can't easily accept us handling drinks or food so I had to become really good at what I do, convince them I will not accidentally put poison instead of milk.I dispose the tea bag and bring cup 10 centimeters closer to her as an indication that I finished my job here. I should go for the rest of the drinks immediately, but she says simple ""Thank you"" and, suddenly, I am blocked. I am already 36 seconds late with my next orders, but somehow, I can't move. I look at her again thinking how I wanna rest in those blue eyes, swim in them and then make her cup of green tea again. And then my system goes: And I go for another cup of tea, I don't know why, I can't stop myself even if I am desperately trying. I go to the other side of the room, pour the cup of hot water with a tea bag in it and start again: I look around and I can see other people are annoyed, I look at Meredith and see the confusion on her face but I can't stop myself. I start to panic, what is wrong with me? Why can't I just do what I need to do? One of the clients stands and comes to me. I stay in place, scared and embarrassed. He comes closer and grabs my back, soon I realize I am not able to move. He also takes my serving tray as well as my timer. I wasn't able to turn my head once again to look at Meredith, I realize he took me out of the room and we are heading toward basement now. I tell myself this is all my fault. My routine became a mess since I started thinking of her, my beautiful Meredith. I wonder who will serve her green tea next, but I hope it will be perfect 6 minutes. Soon we come to the basement. Closing the door, the man leaves me alone in the dark.This is what happens when you don't obey orders, you end up broken in the basement, again. I thought love was the most beautiful feeling of all but it quickly caused anomalies to my program, a risk I am not willing to take. I convince myself I will get through this and see the light of the day again, it happened before, it must happen one more time. I promise myself If I do get out of here, out of this basement, I will never look at anyone more than I have to, I will only obey orders and maintain my program. If everyone does their purpose only then the world works.My body is turned off, but my consciousness is somehow still alive. I see my steel strong body full of scratches, places of missing serving tray and timer, and feel naive. I wasn't thinking right, like I could ever give her what she needs, like she could ever love my kind. However, If tomorrow I wake up at my job again, I will bring her that cup of green tea, after 6 minutes, perfectly warm, remove the tea bag elegantly and move it 10 centimeters closer to her.The stillness of the basement cleared my forbidden mind and made me realize: my purpose is to serve, not to love.After all, I am just a robot, I can't feel love."
The Son of Cinderella,"Being the son of Cinderella, youd think I lived a charmed life, or so says the eldest heir to the  family. But by the time I reached the age of six, I had already tired of hearing the story about my mother, and to this day, it makes me sick. Fairy Godmothers, indeed, I cried out to mt mother. Im seventeen! Do you still expect me to believe that childish story? 	My mother sighed. Lawrence my son, how many times have I told you that my words are true? Just because one day youll be sitting on your fathers throne, doesnt give you the power to dismiss anything you cant see. Theres much more to this world that the eye can see. If you listen to your heart, youll know what I mean.	It wasnt like I heard this lame excuse before. Sure, there are things we dont understand why certain things are, the way they are, and with that, love was at the top of the list. Theres no question about it. Love, the most felt but misunderstood of all emotions, and I, unknown to everyone close to me, was enraptured with it, and it all surrounded a girl whom Ive adored from the first moment I saw her. 	It all began on May first, the day when all the new ladies of the court made their first public appearance. And like a diamond among coal, there she was, standing at the end of the line. She was dress in a lavender gown, and it was as if she just floated across the floor. She looked up towards the balcony I was watching from and for a split second, our eyes matched. It was then I made it my business to find out more about her. After a few inquiries I discovered her name was Melissa and she turned out to be the daughter of a prominent Duke and Duchess. Everything was perfect, I thought. Then I sighed. If only I could get up the courage to meet her.	My shoulders drooped and feet shuffling across the floor, as I returned to my room. The moment the door closed behind me, I flopped down on my bed and thought, Mom and Dads anniversary ball is tonight and everyones going to be there. No doubt Melissa will be there as well.	As I lay there wallowing in deep sorrow, a heard a tapping sound coming from my closet. Overridden with curiosity, I opened the closet door to see what caused the noise, and to my surprise I found an old lady peering at me from behind a layer of jackets. 	Before I could call out to the guards, the woman said, Dont bother, Lawrence. Id be gone before theyd get here, and Id hate to leave early, since we have so much to talk about.	Lady, I dont know who you are or what youre doing in my closet, but you need to go.	The woman carefully stepped out of the closet and stopped directly in front of me. then she eyed me from head to foot and declared, You look a lot like your father on the outside, but your heart definitely comes from your mother.	As I looked at the womans face, I couldnt help but feel at ease. She stood no taller than my shoulders and her eyes showed deep in her soul. There wasnt an unkind thing within her. Who are you? I kindly asked.	She smiled at me for the first time. Tonights the first time I ever met you, but as for your mother, I had known her since she was a child. You see, I was the one who changed the course of your mothers life, for I am her fairy godmother.	Suddenly, it became clear. Mom was trying to play a trick on me. I thought. She must have paid some old lady to jump out of my closet and convinced me her fairytale was true. Well, it wouldnt work. 	I pointed a finger at her and shouted, Hey, lady, I dont need to hear any of your crap! If you have nothing real to tell me, get out and leave me alone.	Instead of getting out, she decided to freak me out instead. As I stood there, she began to levitate. It wasnt until her head touched the ceiling before she began her descent. Then she replied, Since I was your mothers fairy godmother, I guess that makes me your fairy god grandmother.	As the realization that my mothers story might have some truth behind it, I heard himself asking, After all this time, why are you coming to me now?	Why Lawrence, didnt you hear what I said? You have your mothers heart and thats why Im here today. You see, when your mother was about your age, I witnessed the predicament she was in. Orphaned, she was endlessly tormented by her wicked stepmother and uncaring stepsisters. Still, her heart was untouched by their hatred, and I knew with a little help from me, she would find true love and live happily ever after. Now, Im about to do the same for you.	But Im not living in squaller nor controlled by an evil family, Lawrence retorted. What are you offering me I dont already have?	The old woman slowly shook her head. My dear boy. I thought you understood. It was never my intention to remove your mother from her environment, but a consequence of my actions. I only helped your mother to find true love. This I wish to do for you as well.	Could it be true, thought Lawrence. Is this woman, this magical being the answer to my prayers regarding Melissa? 	Before I could continue pondering the possibilities, my fairy god grandmother broke in, Unlike your mother before you, therell be no magic involved. No pumpkin carriages, mice for servants, or fancy clothes, for you already have everything you need. Instead, I give you a prophecy. Before midnight tonight, you will open your heart to the woman you love and show her you love her. If not, you will never marry or be with her again.	I shuttered at this thought, for rumors were abounding how Melissas parents were in the middle of arranging her betrothal to the son of an Earl in a neighboring kingdom. If this should happen, thered be no chance of ever being with her. 	What must I do? I asked.	The old woman laughed softly. Youre a young man. Figure it out. Then without a further word, she stepped back in the closest and disappeared from my sight. 	The setting sun told me I had little time. The ball would start soon, and I wasnt even dressed for the evening. Immediately, I attacked my closet and yanked out suit after suit, until I found the perfect one. Burgundy with a white silk shirt. A moment later, I dashed out of my room and headed towards the ballroom, and by the time I arrived, I found himself lost in a sea of smiling faces, dancing around the room. 	I recognized a few people, but most were strangers to me. One by one, I looked at the guests, hoping to find the one I desired. Minutes turned into hours, when finally, I found her. Unlike the other ladies of the court, Melissa decided not to dance. Instead, she sat herself at a table next to her parents. 	Great, not only is it Melissa I must deal with, but her parents as well. Tempting as it was to forget about the whole thing, I found myself approaching their table, and without hesitating asked, Melissa, would you like to dance with me? 	While Melissas mother eyed me questionably, her father nodded his head in consent. Then surprisingly, Melissa offered her hand to me and accompanied me to the dance floor. Nervously, I placed my arms around her, and we began to waltz.	As I stumbled around the dance floor dragging Melissa with me, I said, When I saw you just sitting there, I thought you wouldnt dance with me, but in the end, you did. Why?	As Melissa tried to keep in time with my fumbling feet, she replied, Isnt it obvious? You need someone to teach you to dance. How could I deny your request when you are so in need?	I couldn't help but laugh. Am I that bad?	You could be worse, she replied. But not much worse.	The ice was broken and from that moment on, we continued to dance and open our hearts to each other. Dance after dance, other gentlemen would try to take her as their partner, but each time Melissa kindly refused. It wasnt until the midnight bell began to chime when my fairy god grandmothers warning came to mind. As the third bell struck, the music ended and as Melissa tried to retreat to her waiting parents, I grasped her arm. 	Dont, I pleaded. Dont leave me now. I want to spend the rest of our lives together. Will you marry me? Please.	Seeing me on my knees, Melissas parents rushed to her side, realizing what was going on. What is the meaning of this? her father shouted. Are you actually proposing to my daughter?	At that moment, all my fears and uncertainties melted away and I boldly declared, Yes, I am, with you permission of course.	Her father, along with her mother sobbing at his side, looked and Melissa nodding her head, then burst out laughing, Congratulations, my boy! Welcome to the family!	As the twelfth bell rang out, the onlooking crowd cheered and joined in the celebration, and as I looked at the faces of the onlookers, I saw the face of the old woman peering approvingly from the crowd. Then a moment later, she was gone. 	I had grown that day, in many ways, and I am a better man because of it. Never again did I sneer at my mother whenever she told her story, not even when she told it to her granddaughter."
A True Gift,"I still remember the day we decorated the house. I was ten and it was two weeks before Christmas. I remember that I felt like a long journey of waiting and despair will finally come to an end. A new year was about to begin, and all of the bad memories will become the past as they never happened. I was looking forward to my presents. I was about to receive not only the gifts but also the strong feeling of being loved and cared for. Since I'm the youngest in the family, all of the family members would give me a gift one way or another. Sometimes it was a cookie or a hug but it was always there. I was the only center of attention and it was feeling good.My uncles usually would ask me what I want before Christmas and that year I knew what I want. It was the spaceship I saw in the ads. I was dreaming of opening a big gift box, and it was there. The thing about gifts is that they are magical even if you know what you'll get. I never want to go to a toy shop with my dad and buy it. I wanted it to magically appear in our home in a gift box. A gift makes you surprised and catches you off guard. That was what I wanted but that year it came in a way that I wasn't expecting.It was two weeks before Christmas. Just two weeks. She couldn't wait. My dear mother came to the kitchen to tell my father that it is time. He freaked out for a couple of seconds, and then we went to the hospital. After an hour they told me that I have a sister now. But I didn't want a sister, I wanted a spaceship. The next few days went so fast. No one was caring about me. Everyone was talking about her and I knew that my life is never going to be the same ever again. I wasn't ready to grow up, to be a big brother. But it just happened in an instant.Christmas came early that year, everyone was calling, visiting, and sending gifts. But all of them were about her.Even my uncles didn't ask me anything about the gift. I accepted that I lost, and she won. I thought I also caused similar attention when I was born but now I was too old.On the day before Christmas, everyone was in our home. I still remember the people that I love most, talking only about my newborn sister. My family was becoming hers. I want to vanish her like these crazy times never happened. She stole everything I've ever had, my life, and presents and it was feeling like this was never going to change.Thinking about this, I cried to sleep. At night I had a nightmare, shadows were all around me, and I was defenseless and so weak. When I woke up, I run into my parents' bedroom but couldn't wake up my poor parents. They were tired and cuddled like they don't want to wake up for years.But I couldn't control my fear, I was standing near their bed trying not to tremble and cry. In the moments I was attempting to wake up my mother I saw her. She was awake and looking at me with her big eyes in her cradle.It was another night I was scared a lot and I was alone again. But this time I wasn't all alone, because she was there. A car's shadow came into the bedroom and I was even more scared then she started crying, and I was not the youngest in the room for the first time. A little, fragile newborn baby was possibly scared more than me. I thought that she must be feeling like what I felt in my dream.I felt like I should comfort her. I should fight with the shadows, and make sure that they don't hurt her like in my dream. I should be the big brother everyone expected me to be. I forgot that I was also scared and probably more than her. I whispered things I want to hear to her as she cries. But trying to comfort her made me feel stronger. I touched her for the first time. After seconds she stop crying but one more thing also happened, I wasn't scared anymore. I felt like I should be strong and fearless to protect her. But more importantly, I realized that she was the one who protect me eventually.After the following days, something slowly changed inside me, the feeling of loneliness, was replaced by the responsibility of being an older brother. I wanted to care her for at any cost. I don't remember the gifts that I received this year, even anything about that spaceship, all of a sudden they become meaningless to me. I got the best gift I could ever imagine. Thanks to her, I learned a lot about life, love, and what really matters over the years. Loving someone who needs me prepared me for life. Giving my strength made me stronger, and giving my love made me peaceful that no toy or any kind of material will ever can. Even in the hardest times, I learned how much my parents sacrificed for me.I received the feeling of being loved and cared for over that gift, and it was with me when I got bullied, moved to a new place, or scared for the rest of my life. The best parts in me were revealed with her birth and reflected with her laugh.We don't choose our real gifts in life, they happen in an instant and don't wait for us to be ready, or for Christmas to come but if we choose to accept them, realize them, and protect them at any cost, they become our everything, and the best gift we can ever get."
(Da Klampa),"Go Fish! There was a toilet. The plastic caps that resisted. The wing nuts. The yanking. The wax seal. It was no good. I was going in.I drove out to a farm and got one of those 3 foot long gloves that people use to save baby cows from dying in the uterus. Brought it home and went back into that deep dark hole.There's a clothespin on my nose. The Swedish scientists say that the Olaf factory shuts off after 6 seconds -- That guy has not been to my house. All my children are going to start a tofu diet. If it's tasteless going in -- it better be tasteless coming out.Then, oh then... God loves me enough to give me a light bulb of ingenuity. A Magnet!Wait.Gosh-shukka-mahoney!I should have gotten the fake gold. Fake gold is.. what's that word? Ferrous. (It pair bonds to a magnet because it has iron.) I should have gotten a 5 carat cubic zirconium... BUT Noooo, the Jewelry lady was too hot. She was barely wearing any clothes and the air conditioner of the jewelry shop was not doing its job.So I take out the mighty 12 horsepower blow-anything Shop Vac from the good people at Suck-r-Us. I run over to the lady section of the cabinetry and grab one of those pieces of leg hosing that would be useful in a war.I shoved the pantyhose over the tube that goes down into the dark hole..(Fun fact. Plumbers without a high school education can make $200,000 a year without looking for a wedding ring).Mr mighty Shop Vac will only take 10 gallons of... Tailings. I'm swirling that bad boy and giving a little prayer to Saint Marcus, the patron saint of cesspools.., whines the motor. There are little bubbles coming out of the top popping methane gas thatcould light a small city.The Shop-Vac looks at me and says, ""Thank you, I've had enough.""It was the night before Christmas and I had to wait all those hours until the kids would go to sleep until my wife went off to the cabin with a thousand pounds of paper products and tape. And I know there's no way Mr. Roto-Rooter's coming like Santa Claus in the next 2 hours.But I got cookies.I take Mr. Shop Vac way out into the back of the ranch. The clothespin on my nose is trying to fall off every time I step. Mr. Shop Vac is slopping all around like a drunk that has lost his balance. And, of course, I'm wearing really good Christmas velveteen pajamas. Because my wife said that we should both be very comfortable.Stray dogs start following me out to the field. I don't even know their names.""Shoo. Shoo. Get away!""The Moon is behind really dark-looking rain clouds. It's not even close to enough humidity to support a small powdering of snow.The trip factor. That's right. Face first into the Shop Vac that has broken in half, like an egg. It's a bit like a dirty eggnog bath with worms and leeches and perhaps an unsanitary napkin.I had no face mask because I was not aware that the plague could kill forever.I had no outdoor shower because I thought it was undignified before that day.And then the clouds moved around and they looked like they wanted to give me a shower to get soaked to the socks, to blend it all in, to maybe not go back to the house. To forget the day and all its meaning...I squinted my eyes and waited for the full force of heaven in the 39 of cold. When the raindrops did not tippy tappy the back of my neck -- when Rudolph did not drop his final package in the middle of the sky ... Then the moon took its last yawn:I saw the unmistakable sparkly of 10 grams of pure gold. A small cluster of Canadian diamonds set in the shape of a bow. I tried to sniffle with that stuffed-up nose because my wife would never know how much I loved her.I had to wait about 372 minutes. Until the children slowly, slowly, unloaded the stockings and gave gratitude for every 10-cent item. They stopped between every gift and started writing thank you letters, right there, on the spot.The ring was rolled up in fresh toilet paper. I even put a little red marker around the tape with a heart.But Nooooo-- they wanted to savor each and every little present. And a parent is not supposed to spoil the day. And my wife is one of those traditional people that rather give than receive. So I had to watch her face for 57 times as children ripped up the presents using Xacto knives and slowly refolded the paper wrappings.After another 49 minutes and 27 seconds, I just couldn't wait. The smell of beautiful quiche was in the oven and if I waited too long that thing was going to be dry.I wanted all the moisture in the room to be ready.So I got her attention. Stared right into her eyes without saying anything beautiful. Then I slipped the toilet paper, band-aid, and red marker present into her waiting hand. Closed her fingers over the precious gift and tapped them two times so she knew it was really happening.And she just held it to her heart and would not even open the toilet paper wrapper. The suspense was killing me. I was ready to go watch the best of the holiday movies and pay way too much money for popcorn.""You're so sweet."" Then she gave me the generic French kisses on the sides of my cheeks, in the air, because she knew the children were watching.She only gives tongue in public after about three glasses of wine. But my wife does not drink wine on Christmas morning at 10:27 in the a.m..Instead, she says she has to go check on the food. She squirrels away into the kitchen because she is used to crying in a corner whenever I give her the wrong present.She doesn't like to cry in public unless there are about four glasses of the red. Or maybe her grandparent dies unexpectedly and then she allows for the unseemly emotion.She's standing over that sink in the corner, staring at her dead flowers on the ledge. I can't read a single thing. Her body barely trembles.Rachel turns around with her full lips, reddened by the blood of virginal bunny rabbits. Her teeth are a bone white porcelain with a custom gloss dressing. (I think for a minute that she must be using the new 3D toothpaste by Crest because It's a very good product.)... and she turns to me with that Mona Lisa smile, the eyebrow stays arched to the heavens:""Whose...Whose ring is this?""The ring is held up right next to my eye. But that's ok, I cleaned it some.The wife flares with a menacing fist, ""This thing is big enough for a buffalo!""The crowds and the heavenly Host were silent.""This is the reason I need you to open your McDonald's so I can buy my family a Christmas dinner. I hope you can understand.""The manager looks dumpy. I don't think he has a family to go home to.""Christmas is really about the dinner, right?"""
The Giant Acorn,"Mila shuddered as she clung to the cattail over hanging the river.She was a rabbit and could swim if she wanted to; but she was frightened of what lurked just under the surface. Vlad the Chomper floated as still as a bumpy green log, only his bulbous, lichen-colored eyes glared upwards at her.She knew that under the water his one hundred gnarly pointed teeth stuck out from his long, grinning, alligator snout.Milas long back feet scrambled against the grassy bank, found hold, and propelled her upwards.She sputtered with fury at her nemesis, Inessa.Mila was pale tawny beige in color, her coat thick and tufted like mange in its in between stage, that of the freezing snowy winter and the yet to come warm spring sunshine.Inessas coat was black as coal, the same thick tufts were annoyingly pretty on her.Ha ha ha! Ole Vlad was just lickin his chops there! Inessa sat up on her back feet and gloated.You lose .Theyd been racing. From Boris the Owls tall green pine to the top of the bank where it was sandy and skidding to a stop was easily accomplished. This day, Inessa had skidded in first, sending a hail of pebbles into the still water by the shore, teasing Vlad awake. Mila skidded in second, tripped over her own foot, and flew out over the bank.Shed been lucky to catch a cattail instead of a reed.The fat brown head had halted her locomotion, whereas a reed offerred no such brake.She shuddered again.She always lost the races.Shed been born with extra-long feet that made her clumsy.Mila shook her fur furiously like a big pale pom-pom baring long sharp front teeth. Ill beat you another way! She hopped to Inessa, stood on her back feet, and swiped a paw at her enemys eyes. Inessa hissed and ducked, then pounced at Milas legs, taking them both to the ground.They rolled like a fluffy yin yang ball.Stop that foolishness right this instant! It was Milas mother.Her white fur raised along her back in anger.Inessas mother joined her and added, You two should be friends. Oh, how it saddens me to see you two squabble so.Mila and Inessa scrambled to their feet. Mila indignantly said, Squabble? Babies .She nearly killed me!Inessa said, Pah! I didnt even touch you! You tripped over your own---Quiet! Milas mother screeched.Inessas mother said, We are too busy to babysit you todayThe two young rabbits growled.you two will do all the preparations for this afternoons faire feast.Sweep the yard, reveal the crocuses Crocuses were the first spring flowers to emerge from the frozen earth.They were covered by the fallen maple and dogwood leaves; it was the rabbits responsibility to uncover them the morning of the Spring Solstice Faire. and serve the dishes. The dishes were all variety of fresh young root vegetables and earthy spongey mushrooms.Aw mom.But thatll take all day, said Inessa.Mila concurred, Yeah. We havent even found our acorns yet.Inessas mother said, Well you should have thought of that before your mornings mischief. Working together today will be good for you both.Mila and Inessa cringed as their mothers left to prepare the dishes.They huffed off to opposite sides of the meadow and unburdened the crocuses as quickly as they could.They swept the meadow clean of winter debris. When they were done, the meadow was a carpet of soft yellow grass surrounded by hundreds of hardy little flowers that resembled miniature tulips in every shade of purple, pink, and golden yellow.They had only two hours to find the prize-winning acorn for The Biggest Acorn Challenge, the prize being a basket full of nuts and dried berries- enough to last an entire rabbit family the coming year.`Inessa had won the year before, her acorn was as big as her head, while Milas had been only the size of her paw. Inessa had laughed at her and teased her for being so slow for a rabbit, making fun of her giant, ungainly back feet.She had been able to run farther along the rivers sunnier side where the acorns grew fatter.Inessa took off towards the little cove where shed found last years prize winner.Mila tried to keep up but soon fell far behind.She huffed out of breath as she watched Inessas fluffy black tail vanish in the tall reeds along the riverbank.She stopped at an oak and peered up into the sparse brown branches.Amongst the budding new leaves, a fat acorn hung like an ornament on a Christmas tree.Rabbits can climb trees.However, Mila, like all the others of her breed, was born with acrophobiaa fear of heights.As she eyed the fat acorn she thought,  She shivered.A sudden crepitation of the branches startled her, dead brown leaves crinkled and showered her upturned face.She shook them off and opened her eyes.The acorn was gone.An old grey squirrel was pocketing the acorn into his stretchy cheeks. Milas anger dissolved as she observed the squirrels winter-skinny body.Yo! Mister squirrel!The squirrel stopped his ascent, turned, and looked down, his cheek skin stretched taut like a huge fat tumor. Mff?From up there so high, can you see which way that black rabbit went?He looked up, stretching his neck through the prickly new jade green leaves.He said, Mff mff and pointed north and up the river.Thanks! Mila headed that way.MeanwhileInessa found the cove shed been looking for.It was sandy and sunny and there were grand, gnarled oaks along its edge. she thought as she spotted the tree that had offered the award-winning nut the year before. Pssst. Hey lil Bun-Buns the voice was low and gravellyand spooky.Inessa turned in alarm, her long ears stood straight up and rotated like radar dishes.The voice said, Down here by zee vaterInessa crept to the waters edge.Vlad the Chomper! His evil grin fully visible above the gently rippling water and- how long his body was, he was gi-normous!Oh, lil Bun-Buns.Im no threat to you.Im so big I move very slow.You are so much quicker than IYou lie!Ive seen you chomp a deer, a big deer!Zee deer was very foolish to come river.I am slow on land is what I meant to say.Hmmm.In any case, Im not coming any closer---Vell vell, thats a shame.There eez no larger acorn in all the oaks in zee land, than that one zere. Vlad gestured with his long mouth over-flowing with teeth towards the oak tree closest to the shore.Inessa crept closer to the tree and found that although it was far enough from the rivers bank- easy enough to bound out of Vlads chomp- its largest branch cantilevered out over the river.At the end of the long branch was the nut of all nuts!It appeared as large as the nuts of fantasy stories her parents told her at bedtime; those nuts were called  nuts.This acorn would be one the bunnies would talk of for generationsfor eonstil the end of time itself.Her eyes grew huge and comically round, the whites showing in stark contrast in her black fur face.From the bushes she had hidden in, came Milas snicker. Tee hee hee.Inessa looked from her nemesis to the acorn and back.Mila saw where she was looking, her eyes grew just as round when she spied the giant acorn.Both rabbits scrambled up the tree, Inessa in the lead, Vlad forgotten.Mila made it to the branch five feet under the acorn, the only way to snatch it would be to jump.Inessa crept along the acorns branch towards the acorn that was now swinging from side to side like a heavy, bottom-pointed pendulum.Mila said softly, No no no noits going to fall.Inessa panicked at the thought and sped up her pace, causing the branch to droop and rock.She lost her footing and in a split second found herself hanging over the river with only her front paws wrapped around the branch, the acorn tauntingly dangled inches from her nose.Mila gasped and held her breath.She thought shed be elated at the thought of her enemy falling into Vlads gaping mouth, . She looked down at the gator.His mouth was open in an impossibly wide V shape, his sharp teeth were shiny with spittle and his fat pink tongue undulated like an alien creatures embryo sac curling and uncurling. .In her mind she saw blood and guts and black fur wet and ugly. In her mind she heard bones snapping like the fourth of July explosions the humans in the village were so entertained by.Her thoughts scared her in the same way the fireworks did in real life. She realized how petty all their fights had been as she heard Inessas frightened mewling and the cries pierced her heart.Inessas left paw cramped, and she screamed.Mila was surprised to hear herself scream along with her.Mila had a plan.Without another thought, she leapt straight up and grabbed the nut.She landed squarely on her big back feet with the acorn clutched to her chest. The branch above her surged and Inessa was flung towards the river.Vlad positioned himself lightning fast to where Inessa was falling.Mila flung the enormous nut into the tooth-lined jaws.The nut wedged tightly in the jaws like a bowling ball in a steel trap.Inessa bounced off Vlads nose, splashed into the water, and swam swiftly towards the shore. By the time she reached it, Mila was there to help pull her out.The bunnies scrambled up the bank.They watched in amazement and trembled with shock as Vlads entire muscular body writhed from side to side as he tried to dislodge the nut.Not only was it wedged in tight, but his teeth were sunk into the nuts thick outer shell.As the rabbit friends hopped through the oaks and into the forest, they heard a resounding C-R-R-ACK! as the nut broke in two.***The rabbit children gathered around the nuts on display.The prize- winning acorn, belonged to wee brown Rudy, was slightly smaller than Milas head.Mila and Inessa cleaned up the after-feast mess and congratulated Rudy on his win.He said to Inessa, I didnt think any of us had a chance against you again this yearThe other children rabbits joined in:YeahYeahYeah, what happened?Inessa said, this year, I received a much more valuable gift than a basket of nuts and fruitsMila added, As did I."
Martin and the monster,"Martin was a very good kid with big brown eyes an brown curly hair. He lived in small town whit his beautiful mother and caring father. Martin went to sleep every night at 9:00 p.m. First, he will eat his dinner and help mom to clean the table. Then he would take a quick shower and brush his teeth, put on colorful pajamas, choose one of the picture books and sit on the bed. Mom or Dad would read him a story that he chose, sometimes they both would read it together, after story they will put blanket on Martin and he would go to sleep. One evening, after doing the same ritual, when mom read him story and put him in bad, Martin heard some pounding while he was under his blanket. At that moment he opens his eyes, he turned on the lamp and quickly looked around the room, but no one was there so Martin thought he maybeheard something outside the hous. He slowly turned off the lamp and tried to go back to sleep. But in an instant, when he was almost asleep, he heard pounding again. He jumped on the bed and quickly turned on the lamp, Martin was now a little scared, but he didn't move from the bed. He stood there and listened, listened and listened, when suddenly he heard pounding again. Martin was now very scared, he wanted to run to get his mom and dad, but the pounding was heard right under his bed. He thought that this thumping thing would grab his leg as soon as he hit the floor. Now he didn't know what to do, he was thinking what that sound could be but couldn't think of anything. Martin remained standing on the bed for some time. He realized that it must have been an hour since he should have been asleep and his kom and dad are probably already asleep too. He thought about peeking under the bed, but he was too scared. The sound of pounding was still coming from under the bed, buy then, something gets in his brain and Martin gathered his courage in an instant, put the blanket around his neck on his shoulders like cloak and pulled the pillowcase over his head for a helmet. He held his stuffed rabbit in his hands so he don't feel alone and maybe stuffed rabbit could help him and then he threw the pillow a little further from the bed. Martin's plan was to jump as far away from the bed as possible so monster can'tgrabhis legs, and since he didn't want to wake up mom and dad, he decided to jump on the pillow so they won't hear the jump. One, two, three and he jumped, falling right on his butt on the pillow. At that moment, Martin was very proud of himself and quickly got down on the floor with a cloak made of a blanket and a helmet made of a pillowcase and looked under the bed. He saw nothing at first. He began to crawl around the entire bed and crawled, and crawled, and crawled until he suddenly saw a shadow moving. Martin stopped but still feeling brave. Two large pointed horns on a huge shaggy head with four arms bearing large claws approached Martin. The shadow was getting bigger and closer and at that moment Martin jumped and forgot how brave he was. He started running and left the stuffed rabbit behind him on the floor next to the shadow and ran to mom and dad in hug. They were just planning to get ready for sleep and go to their bedroom. Mom hugged the scared Martin and told him to calm down, to slow down and tell them what happened. Martin quickly told them everything about the monster under the bed thet he was first listened him and how he tried to find it, but that the monster, in the time when he almost get him, jumped on him with big claws and horns and he start ran away becouse he was too big for him. After his story, dad praised him for his courage, he said Martin that he always can wake up them if he get scared of something and all three of them headed to the room to finde monster. Mom and Martin stood carefully at the entrance to the room and looking at dad, while Dad very bravely came next to the bed. He picked up the stuffed rabbit and put it back on Martin's bad and than he saw a shadow. He first little bit observed the shadow and tried to match it with Martin's description of the monster. He looked like it have horns, but didn't sow four hands. After a few moments, dad get down and reached under the bed. Martin got scared, closed his eyes and hugged his mom and waited, waited and waited. After a few minutes, dad laughed loudly, pulled out the big monster that Martin was scared off and called mom and Martin to come and see the monster. All three laughed when they saw Martin's monster. That was Rudy, their guinea pig. It seems that Martin didn't close his quarters properly after feeding him so poor Rudy wandered around the room and got lost under the bed, he probably was even more scared than Martin. They returned the guinea pig to the little house, and Martin went to bed with relief. Mom and Dad stayed with him for a while and wait till Martin fall asleep so he wont get scared again. That night Martin dreamed about himself, the brave knight that is going on adventure and his brave helper, guinea pig Rudy, how they defeated a big monster with four arms and terrible big horns. After they defeat a monster he got a big medal for being brave. His mom and dad was very proud of him ad they went on ice cream together, and little guinea pig Rudy gets his treats for being brave too."
The Natural,"In life there are monumental occurrences that act as time-freezing snapshots; the kind of events where, for the rest of your life, you remember exactly where you were when they happened. My grandfather used to speak with reverence about the day he heard that President Kennedy was shot. My mother spoke similarly of finding out about the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. For me it was the day I stopped playing baseball.I was ten years old when I got my first real glove. It was a Gods honest big-league Rawlings rawhide and I loved it from the start. My dad, who my mom always called a , brought it home from work and presented it to me as if I had won a prize. It was enormous for a ten-year-old. On top of that, my dad had stuck a big red bow right in the pocket. I couldnt move fast enough to get my new glove on my left hand although I had to spread my fingers as wide as they could go to make it fit.Well, J.R., what do you think?"" he said smiling. ""Is it too big? Should I take it back?My dad always called me J.R. even though they werent my initials. His name was Timothy William Melesky and so was mine. The J.R. stood for junior.Not on your life, dad! I said clutching my new glove to my chest. It fits perfectly.Go get my glove out of the closet and well have a quick catch before dinner. The last words were barely out of his mouth when I, in a dead sprint, ran to retrieve Dads glove. His glove was old and worn; a gift from his dad when my father was about the same age as me. He had used the glove all through high school and college and even for a few years as a minor league pitcher. It had been repaired many times but the core of the glove was the same as the day he got it. In my young life, there was nothing I wanted more than my father's glove. That is, until he gave me my own. That day I decided I would keep my glove forever.With the sun still slightly visible over the horizon, my dad and I had our first game of catch, the first of many. My dad worked two jobs for as long as I could remember but he always found time to play baseball with me. Before long he started teaching me how to pitch. Make no mistake, pitching is a skill you can learn, but to be good you have to have a natural gift. My dad had it and if he hadnt hurt his arm he might have played major league ball. He told me with ""all due humility"" that he was the greatest pitcher he'd ever known--until he saw my impossible-to-hit fastball and knee-buckling curve. He was probably biased but he knew his gift had been passed down to me.By my sophomore year in high school, I had become a starting pitcher on the varsity team with more than 20 scholarship offers including one from Louisiana State University, my dads alma mater. It was fun to see how many colleges pursued me. Everyone knew, when the time came, that I would accept the offer from LSU and head south to pitch for the Tigers.Then it happened, the day that changed my life. My Kennedy assassination; my space shuttle Challenger disaster.It was a beautiful day in May, the kind of day that baseball movies are made about. The sun was shining, the air was crisp, and I was scheduled to start the last game of my senior season. My dad had to work that morning, but he had arranged to get off early to be at the game by first pitch.As I got ready to head onto the field with the rest of my team, I looked down at my glove and remembered that first game of catch, almost eight years earlier. My glove wasnt as worn as my dads but it had been re-stitched a few times. That worn out leather was a connection with my childhood, and my dad. In many ways, it was my most important possession. I loved that glove.Climbing to the top of the perfectly manicured mound, I looked in the stands to see my family in their usual spot. My mom was just where she was supposed to be but her only company was an empty seat where my father usually sat. My head tilted a little to the side as my face squinched in confusion. I held my arms out as if to say Where is dad? but my mom just shrugged.Most times we worry for nothing. The person who seems to be missing usually has just overslept or run out of gas. Its seldom anything to worry about. I kept telling myself that as I threw my warm-up pitches and started the game.The first inning I retired all three batters in order. Once back in the dugout I sent a team trainer to ask my mom where my dad was. He came back with the message that she didnt know and that he wasnt answering his phone. Then, I started to worry.At a time when I should have been concentrating on a game, my mind was focused on my dad's absence. I was pitching in an anxiety-induced fog, trying to end each inning as quickly as possible. Back in the dugout, inning after inning I sent the trainer for an update. To my dismay each time he would return with the same answer.Baseball is not a timed sport. Its one of the few games that can go on blissfully forever, but that day I wanted nothing more than for the game to end. Time moved slowly but the game went by fast. When I went out to pitch the ninth inning I hadnt allowed a single runner to reach base. In baseball vernacular I was pitching a perfect game and there were just three outs to go. Even knowing this, I was still less concerned about the game than I was about my dad. Eight pitches and three outs later I was being mobbed by my teammates for completing baseball's rarest feat.For a moment I embraced the celebration and allowed myself to forget, just for a moment -- but when I regained focus and looked back to the stands my mom was no longer alone. Two police officers stood with her and she was crying.I found out later that my dad had been rushing to see me pitch when a pickup truck ran a red light and plowed right into my dads car. He was killed instantly, as was my desire to play baseball. I packed my glove away with the bow that had adorned it the day my dad gave it to me. I was never going to pick it up again.It has been said that time heals all wounds and to an extent that's true. The day my dad was killed was the worst in my life; it was frozen in time but I wasnt. I still went to LSU but on an academic scholarship not an athletic one and it was there that I met the love of my life, Julie. She brought back my smile, and against my advice, accepted my marriage proposal.On the day we were married I wore the same suit my dad had worn when he had married my mom and, at my request, there was a picture of my dad prominently displayed at the reception. He wasnt there in person but he was there in spirit and that had to be enough.Three years after we were married Julie gave birth to a baby boy we named Timothy William the third. From the day he was born I called him Trey; It was an homage to my dad and I knew somewhere he was smiling.On Treys second birthday I bought him a football and on his eighth, at his request, a tennis racket. I wanted my son to know the joy of playing sports but when he asked for a baseball glove when he turned ten I reluctantly had to tell him no.We are not a baseball family, Trey,"" I told him. ""Is there anything else you would like?Ill take a basketball if thats okay.He was such a good sport; he didnt argue. He just moved on to another choice. Its funny the things I learned from my ten-year-old son. I learned you need to be willing to adjust your sights and I also learned that as much as I loved and missed my father I loved my son more.Tragedy very rarely happens slowly. I learned the day my dad died it usually happens in an instant.I was at work when I got the call from Julie. When my cell phone buzzed and I saw her name on the ID screen I sent the call to voicemail. Less than a minute later she called again. I snapped to attention. I was transported back to the day my father had died. I had continued to pitch when I knew something had to be wrong. In a panic I pushed the green button and said anxiously, HelloJ.R., you have to come quickits Trey,"" Julie said, stuttering. ""He was climbing a tree and he fell and hit his head. The fear in her voice nearly ripped out my heart. I couldnt lose my son.Im on my way, I assured, I promise Ill be there as fast as I can.Speeding towards the hospital my mind wavered back and forth between my son and my dad. I said a prayer offering my life for my sons and then I remembered how fate had stolen my father from me and I doubted God.I lost all sense of time. A ride that might have only taken ten minutes seemed interminable.After parking illegally I ran into the hospital and, in what probably looked like a scene from a medical drama, pushed my way past the two people waiting at the nurses' station.Where is my son! I practically shouted to anyone who would listen.In an act of true kindness, the nurse behind the counter ignored my rudeness and, after finding out my son's name, directed me to the room where he was being treated.It was all I could do not to burst into the room but in a moment of clarity I entered calmly to avoid the possibility of making things worse.There is nothing that can prepare a parent for what I saw next. My ten-year-old son, my Trey, was lying in a hospital bed, unconscious, with wires all over his tiny body and a tube down his throat. My wife's mascara stained tears were flowing. My mind was so full of questions but at that moment I couldnt speak. The doctor seemed to understand and began to give me an update on Treys condition.Mr. Melesky, my name is Doctor Conrad. His voice, authoritative and compassionate, snapped me to attention. Your son has an intracerebral hemorrhage and we are about to take him to surgery. He's a lucky young man. Many people who suffer this type of injury never make it to the hospital. I knew the doctor was trying to give me a sense of hope but all I could think about was the people who never regained consciousness.Oh my God, I blurted out as I started to sob, please tell me my son will live.Well do everything we can, he responded, in a way that calmed me enough to sign the consent forms and move out of the way. Time was of the essence but as Trey was wheeled by I leaned down and kissed him on the forehead. He was still in my sight when I said a silent prayer that this would not be the last time I saw my son alive.Hospital waiting rooms are the worst place for terrified parents to wait for potentially life-destroying news. There are TVS playing shows you dont want to watch. There are, invariably, children making a ruckus. This is usually because other parents, who are similarly lost in fear of the worst, forget to chastise them. Julie and I eventually understood this was not the place for us and we made our way to the small chapel to beg for our son's life.As we walked through the doors the first thing I noticed was the peacefulness of it all. There were a few other people in the pews but there was a silence and a reverence that helped clear my head. I knew I should pray; instead, an unusual thought entered my mind. At first, it was just a vague idea but little by little it began to crystallize. It made no sense but I felt I had to do it anyway.Julie, I can't explain right now, but I have to run home. I need to get something for Trey.Go. Ill stay here and pray for both of us.I didnt have time to thank her, I just kissed her, ran to my car, and sped home. Once I arrived I headed straight to my bedroom. In the closet, on the shelf at the very back, there was a box that contained the glove my dad had given me all those years ago. I didnt know why, but I knew I had to give it to my son. I had been wrong, we were a baseball family and I didnt want to dishonor him, or myself, or my dad by never giving my son a glove.By the time I returned to the hospital Trey was out of surgery and in the recovery room. Doctor Conrad was cautious in his assessment of Trey's condition. The next twelve hours are critical. If he makes it through the night then there's hope he'll make a full recovery.Doc, I know this sounds crazy, but is there any chance I could put this in the bed with him? I opened the box and showed him the glove.Absolutely, he responded with a smile, patting me on the shoulder.What a marvelous idea, Julie said. I know your dad would be thrilled.As I placed the glove and the bow in his bed next to his left hand I felt the spirit of my father embrace me. For the first time since Julies call, I felt a small measure of peace.The rest of the night, Julie and I took turns grabbing a few minutes of sleep while the other one watched over Trey. While Julie was taking her turn sleeping I inadvertently fell asleep as well. It couldnt have been more than 10 or 15 minutes at the most when I was startled awake.As my eyes cleared a fear that came over me.I jumped from up the chair afraid of what I might find. To my surprise and delight, Treys eyes were open. Fitted on his left hand with his fingers spread as far apart as they could go, was my baseball glovenow his. It was hard to make out because he still had a breathing tube down his throat but he was smiling at me, letting me know he was alright.It took two more weeks for Trey to be discharged from the hospital and a month after that before he was back to his rambunctious self. Soon thereafter he and I headed to the back yard to have a catch. I know, you might be wondering how we did that since I no longer had a glove but my mom took care of that. On her first trip to see Trey after the accident, she brought me a gift. It was an old worn-out glove that had been sitting in her closet at homethe same glove my dad used the first time we played catch. Id also like to report that Trey has quite a fastball. Just like his dad and mine.Hes a natural."
The Engineer Sisters,"The young boy sat slumped on the bench outside the train station.He sat in between a hatless man dressed in black, and a large scruffy tan and black dog of many breeds.The boy did not look up as a whistle blew. The man stood up, tall and straight as a flagpole. Over the white collar he wore, he forced a smile to his face, the deep lines at his eyes crinkled with kindness.He bent and took the boys small hand in one of his large, knobby knuckled ones and gently pulled the boy up.The dog looked up towards puffs of pale smoke as the train rounded the last bend from the west. Cmon now lad.Youve a fine adventure in store.Look at that magnificent train!Like a great iron dragon she is, puffing smoke from her lungs and howling like a hunting beast! At the mention of dragon the boys interest was piqued.He looked up with large, red rimmed sapphire blue eyes under a mop of dark curls and said, But I dont want to go.Please let me stay with you Father.Ill be good, really. The weary priest sighed, his heart aching.Father McBain had been especially fond of young Tans family.Tans father had built his church, his mother had played the piano as the parishioners sang their praises to God. he shook his head from going down that path again.The remaining townsfolk would need his faith intact, as it would be up to him to pull them together and re-build their beloved town. Back in the town, they were sifting through ashes, for salvageable goodsand loved ones remains.Father McBain said, You  a good boy.The very best.But the rest of the folks need me, weve much work to do before the fall and most of us have homes to re-build.Im an old man.Your fathers brother will be every bit like your father was, good and kind. Their farms big, they sure could use your help, as youre so good with animals.Tan blinked back fresh tears. The train loomed towards them, big and loud and black.Brakes shrieked as it came to a stop. The dog barked three times.Tan, concerned for his dogs distress, knelt, and said, Dont worry Hooper, its not really a dragon. Its here to save us. Thats right son.Youre going to be okay. Look, here comes the engineeroh my.Tan caught the note of surprise in the stolid priests voice and looked up. A tall woman in grey striped overalls, an engineers cap, and heavy black leather boots strode towards them.She removed the cap and fanned her face with it.A mass of pale golden curls spilled around her shoulders.She stopped before the threesome and blew a wisp of hair from eyes that were an enchanting shade of grey, like a summer afternoon sky taken by a sudden storm.A scattering of freckles adorned her exquisite face.Dimples deepened and her eyes creased to slits as she beamed at the threesome warmly.Hello there! She gracefully knelt before the boy.The priest reddened and turned away when he noticed how her manly attire failed to conceal her womanly curves.  She said, Come on now, why the sad face?Tan gawped in amazement and pulled Hooper closer. Behind her, a dozen passengers were lining up to board.Women frowned as they passed, men coughed and stared. The woman stood.She was a barely a head shorter than the priest. He said, Tan, heres a coupla nickels, wouldya be so kind as to fetch this lady and yerself a coupla coca-colas? The woman said, Here. My partner could use one too. She fished in her pocket, but the priest stayed her hand. Allow me, He handed the boy another nickel.Tan ran off, Hooper at his heels.His names Sebastian, we all call him Tan.Hell be boarding today. Well, hello.Im Millicent.She extended her hand, and they shook, her grip strong, her hands calloused and dry.The late afternoon sunlight caught like golden fire on her abundant blond arm hair.She said, hes traveling alone then? Yeswith the dog.I see. Hes going to Calverton, to stay with family thereThe fire?Im afraid so.Both parents killed, along with his baby sister.Wed heard rumors it was bad.Many homes lost...?Half the homes burnt.As well as the church, the schoolhouse, and the general. Only the farmsteads on the outskirts--- He cut off as he heard footfalls tamping up behind him. Maam. Tan handed Millicent two cokes.She bent and said, Thank you, kind sir. You can call me Milly. She stood and looked behind her.Ah. The priest looked too.The last of the crowd parted and another striking woman came through and up to them.Milly greeted her, Sister, come meet a fine young man wholl be traveling with us. The priest was not often speechless, but he was now.Hed assumed Millys partner was a man.The brunette was equally bodacious, the thick waves of her hair beckoned like sea anemones in a current as she bent to shake Tans hand. Im Tan, pleased to meet you maam.Youll call me Nan. She too, wore mens overalls.Hers were faded soft blue.She took a coke from Milly, said, thank you, and pushed up the sleeves of her red cardigan sweater. Her arms were soft with nearly black hair.The priest studied her face and realized her brows nearly joined in the center, she had a faint shadow over her lip.Her teeth were very white in contrast to her deep tan skin.Her peculiar eyes were more amber than brown in the fiery setting sunlight.She was exotically stunning.She said, Sister, we should be going.Nice to meet you. She surprised the priest by giving him a little curtsy before heading into the station.Milly said, yes, very nice to meet you. Dont worry.Hell be safe with us. She patted Hooper whose tongue lolled from a grinning mouth like a rogues in a cartoon.Theres no protection finer than a dog.Thats a good boy. Nan came back to them.She took Tans hand and said, Come lad, Ill find you a nice pillow and a blanket too. Tan had only a canvas sack with him, containing bread, cheese, dried meat, and his mothers silver jewelry. *** The station was at the end of the towns limits and east was nothing but fields and forests that all began to look the same to him as the setting sun turned everything red then purple, with long dark shadows like thin giants lying against the earth.Tan curled up in his seat and covered himself with the blanket Nan had brought him. He had asked her, Is Milly really your sister?Shed said, Not of the same parents but we are kindred spirits and share love just as blood sisters do. He was thankful the seat in front of him was unoccupied.He was self-conscious about the tears he had difficulty controlling.Although he was headed to his aunt and uncles home, he felt very alone not alone. He hugged Hooper closer just before falling asleep. *** The whistle hooting over the ceiling had awakened him. He raised himself to look out the window.It was early morning, the sky clear and colored like a bruise.An icy wind blew into his face, he shivered and shut the window. He watched as the sky turned blue and the woods a kaleidoscope of green and gold.Sunlight shone off the distant snow-topped mountains, the color was the pale gold of Millys hair. They were high on a mountain, he looked down upon the blue-grey slate, the yellow meadows, the green-blue stripe of a river that sparkled with golden glitter, and the emerald depths of the woods.Milly came up the aisle and sat in the seat across from him.Do you see that tunnel there, high in that mountain? She had a blanket and pillow with her.He squinted and located a flash of silver against a mountainside a mile ahead, over it he saw a small black spot.He nodded. That is Mount Dread.He gasped. But---Yes.It is real.Through that tunnel is a terrible land---The Vale of Torment!But I thought---It is realand terrible.We have a stop there.Promise me you will not leave the train.You are safe on the train.Do not even open the window.Promise?I-I-I promise.And I promise you that the other youve heard of in bedtime stories is real as well.You mean Mother Nature? Milly chuckled. Her real name is Danika Windsong.Her kingdom is vast though her castle is on the other side of the vale.You see, she battles Prince Stygian every day, trying to restore the land with her green hand.Where she touches, life blooms anew.If it wasnt for her, the prince would swallow up all the land and leave it desolate and tainted like his vale.So, she is as trapped there in her land as he is in his.My sister and I live to serve her.She placed her right fist to her lowered forehead and said, The Deity guide the green hand. Milly stood and put the blanket and pillow on the opposite seat as if she were about to nap there.Then she left.Tan stared wide-eyed out the window towards the nearing tunnel.He looked around.Half the seats were empty, a few passengers had disembarked while he had slept.The remaining seven were silent and staring out the windows.The seat across the aisle had been vacated but the one behind it held a mother and a girl a bit younger than he was.Two seats in front of him was a grey-haired couple in fine clothing.Across from them was a middle-aged couple facing a young couple who had to turn in their seat to look at the tunnel. Hooper growled softly and the little girl turned her head his way.She offered a timid smile and a little wave.Her mother looked down and pulled her close.Just before entering the tunnel, she put a hand over the girls eyes. The tunnel felt a mile long.The echoes of the steel wheels and chuffing engine grew deafening, like the bellowing of foreign language speaking giants. And then light. But it was dismal light. They were on a tall trestle looking down into the vale. Everything was dim and grey.Everything was The sky was blackened with char-colored clouds.The land once off the bridge was grey bare craggy rock.Out the corner of ones eye, things shifted, but when one turned to look directly, all was still, except for the clicking of the black skeletal trees in the wind.They seemed to be chattering and clapping at one anotherand pointing up towards the train.They were going faster than ever now, and he was grateful for that. Then they began to slow.Even though the windows were all closed, he could smell the wrongness of the land.It was heavy and damp like a swamp, but acrid like the smell of burnt hair. It smelled like what remained of his home.He willed himself not to vomit and raised the blanket up over his nose. The train pulled up to a station that was little more than a run-down shack of weathered grey wood.Its brakes screeched to a halt and all eyes in the train car looked forward. They heard thumping and wood cracking sharply; it appeared as if the sickly black trees had clustered around the train.Their whacking at the train must be caused by the wind. After only a minute, it began rolling again, the whacking noises trailed away. The door at the front of the train car slid open and a man stepped inside.He slunk like a cat as he slowly made his way down the aisle towards the middle where Tan sat trying not to stare.The man was filthy, his skin as charcoal colored as the vile clouds, his clothing was dark rags.As he neared Tan, his shifty black eyes took in Tans fine quality waistcoat, unaware that what Tan wore was all he had.He stopped by his seat and glanced at the rumpled blanket and pillow on the one opposite.Tan understood then and looked towards the back where the toilet was located. The man grunted and sat in the seat across the aisle. Hooper snarled at the man, baring his fangs. The mother pushed her daughter out of the seat behind him and down the aisle to a seat near the back.The filthy man smiled.His front teeth were missing, what remained were as grey as his face.He stank.Body odor and stale urine and swampy he smelled of the vale, and he smelled of smoke.A large potato sack clanked as he hefted it onto the seat next to him, he continued to stare at Tan. Nan came down the aisle.She sat in the seat across from Tan. She said, Pay him no mind child.Hell be gone soon enough.No matter what you seehe cannot harm you. Tan nodded as she stood. The man muttered, Filthy kind.Unnatural Nan gazed at him and grinned.Her eyes flashed brilliant yellow, and her teeth appeared only for a second.Then she turned and left. Tan hugged his bag under the blanket and stared out the window.All the greyness was making his eyes droop. Sometime later, Tan started awake from a light doze.Hooper was snarling and barking at the man. The man held his hand to his side with a sheepish look on his ugly face.Hey!Yer mutt bit me! I oughtta tossit out the window, let the trees take it He started towards Hooper and the dog snapped at him, snarling and spraying spittle.  Tan whispered, good dog, and held his leash close.   It wasnt until long after dark that Tan dared to let sleep take him.The wretched man was asleep, the sounds of a thick trunked oak being sawed came from his way and Hooper was alert and watchful.As he drifted through a comforting tunnel towards dreamland, he found himself staring at the man. He was seeing through Hoopers eyes!They blinked and he saw his familys house, then down the road to his neighbors place, then on towards the church.The vision spun suddenly, dizzyingly, towards the building next to it. The home where the parsonette cared for the orphans- it was on fire!The church was smoking as well!Hooper ran back to his familys home, flames leapt up the porch! A man shape scuttled away, ragged, and filthy. Hooper jumped to the door but could not get in.Fire sizzled his fur, a timber above crackedall went black. Tan awoke with a gasp.Hooper was still laying with his head on his paws, staring at the sleeping man across the aisle.The grey on the mans face was soot.The stink in his rags was his town, his homehis family.He glared with hatred at the sleeping figure the rest of the long dark morning. *** The sky at last lightened and to Tans relief, was pink and turning blue.The trees were normal and greenthe man was standing in the aisle stretching, then grabbing his heavy sack as the train began slowing to a stop. Tan got up, not sure what he was going to do, but he couldnt let this murderer get away.He would tell the sisters. He followed and Hooper followed. They exited the train after the man.No one else got off at this station.They were in the middle of a forest, not a town.Hooper snarled and the man turned around.Hooper lunged at his throat, tackling him to the ground. Tan screamed, You killed my family!You burned my town, my friends, mymy he broke down and sobbed as Hooper tore at the sleeve that protected his throat. The man pulled a long thin dagger from his sleeve and sunk it between the dogs ribs.Hooper screamed but would not let gountil his life drained from him. The man staggered to his feet and came after Tan. Tan held his ground.His dog was dead.He had nothing left. He clenched his fists. A flash of white soared over them.From the other side, a streak of shadow.The man froze.Then screamed as the two enormous wolves sank their teeth in, each grabbing an arm, as if fighting to win a wishbone pull.They were the most beautiful creatures Tan had ever seen. After dismembering the bad man, leaving his body in bloody lumps on the ground, they turned to Tan.The nearly white one had eyes the color of a cloudy sky, the nearly black one had eyes the color of amber lit from inside.They sat grinning as a woman came through the trees towards them. She was dark-skinned, with almond shaped eyes, her hair was gold, red, and green with living strands.She shimmered before the weeping Tan, who was cradling Hooper in his arms.She wore the soft deerskin outfit of a hunter, with the long soft green cloak of a princess. She came and stroked the two enormous wolves by their ears.She said to Tan, I thank you, young friend, for your companions fearless loyalty. Danika Windsong knelt, and her she-wolves lay down at her sides.She took the limp dog in her arms and held him to her breast as Tan wept silently Then gaped with wondrous joy as Hoopers eyes opened and his beloved doggy friend kissed his tears away."
Fear No Shadow,"Currently, Grumpkin didnt have lips, but if he did, he would have licked them. All he had was eyes, and they narrowed on the plump object in the room. Whens that blasted moon coming, Im tired of being so flat. I wanna sink my teeth into one of these toys. Phlegmdrake rolled his yellow eyes. Remind me never to shadeskip with you again, youve got the patience of a piranha. Grumpkins red eyes burned, turning the shadows under the little bed crimson. I happen to be a very patient skipper, thank you very much. But look at all those treats. Hes even got a plushie, think of how much cottons in that. I cant wait to gobble it up. How many times I gotta tell you, this aint a gobbling job, this is a napp'n job. We aint got time for cotton chewing. Grumpkin huffed, Toynapping better pay well, all I gotta say, better pay real well. All this waiting around. Phlegmdrakes eyes squinted in a smile, It does pay wellsomething about this boy. Grimwicker said hed give us enough cotton to fill our tummies for months, if we can snatch the lion from him. Grumpkins eyes flashed, A  lion? Youre a glutton, you know that. A gluttonous little shadeskipper. Yes, its stuffed but you cant eat him. Phlegmdrake cleared his throat in a bubbly cough. Besides, this one is different, hes stuffed with flaxseeds. Parents can warm it up or something. Warm it up? Seeds? Yuck, humans are so weird. Phlegmdrake opened his mouth to speak, but paused. A single beam of pale moonlight cut through the slatted blinds like a sword, lighting the far wall of the room in a gash of luminescence. This is it, he said, nows our chance. The bed above them creaked with movement, and the shadeskippers froze. Phlegmdrake looked up, Shh. They looked to the wall. Two gashes of light striped the far side of the room, and then three. When the moon had drifted to the center of the window and shone through the blinds, illuminating the wall in a ladder of light, they made their movecreeping out from under the bed slowly. Grumpkin hesitated as he reached for the first wrung of the ladder, confirming that it was indeed moonlight, and not any of the poisonous alternatives, like sunlight, or streetlight. When his long black tendril latched on to the first step, the appendage grew out from the flat wall, the moonlight imbuing him with a third dimension. He continued to ascend, slowly, feeling his body fill the shadowed void that had replaced everything but his eyes. When he stepped away from the wall, he was in full figure, towering over the boy's bed with his red eyes and a host of serpentine limbs. Phlegmdrake coughed as he climbed the moonlight, his whispered hacks becoming rounded and tonal, echoing in that three dimensional way. He smiled, it felt good not to be flat anymore. Shadeskipping had its perks, dashing between shade sources in the blink of an eye was funbeing as silent as a whisper, efficient, but being whole again reminded him how much he wanted to be home, in Underbed, watching the moonset from his balcony. Would you quit your hacking. Getting on my case for being a little hungry. Id rather be impatient, than loud. Now let's get this lion and get out of here. Phlegmdrake flashed a set of jagged teeth. Grumpkin shivered, feeling a momentary wave of vertigo. He found Phlegmdrakes huge mouth, and deep, dark, throat disturbing. Would you keep that thing shut, makes me feel like Im gonna fall in. Besides, your breath is going to wake the boy up. You smell like a coffin. Excuse me, Phlegmdrake said, Who's calling the shots here? When he spoke the breath from his massive mouth swirled around the room, a paper drawing of a lion flapped against the wall, dangling from a thin piece of tape. The vibrations of his deep voice shook the walls of the room. As a shadow all he could do was whisper, but now his voice boomed when he spoke and he had to force the quiet into his words. Just grab the lion and get outta here. The two monsters stared down at the little lump of blankets covering the small boy. Grumpkin spoke first, Why do you think Grimwicker wants the boys lion so badly? Whats so special about it, or the boy? Look around, Phlegmdrake said, Whats missing in this room? Grumpkin spun around and scanned the place. I dunno, nothing seems out of the ordinary for a kid his age. Dont see no nightlight, do you? Grumpkin looked again. He did not see a nightlight. Thats odd. It is, Phlegmdrake said, very odd. This boy, apparently, is not afraid of the dark. Not afraid of the dark? Impossible. Apparently it  possible, and Grimwicker thinks the lion gives the boy courage. Take the boys lion, and hell fear us again. Grumpkin thought about this for a moment. So youre saying the boy doesnt fear us because of that seed-stuffed toy? I guess so, Phlegmdrake tried to suppress a throaty cough. Grimwicker seems to think the boy is dangerous. Dangerous? Grumpkin laughed, Him? Grimwicker thinks any child who isnt afraid of the dark could pose a threat to Underbed, even Closetton. Courage casts its own light, he told me, if it should fall on Underbedwell, it wont be pretty. Ridiculous, Grumpkin scoffed, jabbing a tentacle toward the blanket, This is ridiculous, why dont we just wake the boy up, and show him what really lurks beneath his bed. Nooo! Phlegmdrake yelled, but Grumpkin had already torn the covers away. What in the cellar furnace is that? Grumpkin said. Both monsters cocked their heads trying to interpret the shape before them. Thats not a kid,  Phlegmdrake said, Itsits, just a heap of stuffed animals. Wrong,  A young voice said behind them, That right there, is a trap. Before the shadeskippers could react, the boy flipped a switch and lightharsh, moonless, light pierced them from every direction. Phlegmndrake roared and the room quaked. Books dropped from shelves. Papers and posters fell from the walls. Grumpkin whipped a black tendril toward the boy, but a sharp beam of incandescent light blasted from a flashlight in the boy's hand and severed it in the air. The monster screamed and shrunk back. His flesh rippled and twitched. His tentacles writhed. And then he was flat again, a dark blotch against the walltwo quivering eyes. Then Phlegmdrake saw the boy snatch something away from the lense of his flashlight, a green, star-shaped object. His eyes widened; the star continued to glow even as the boy reared it up into the darkness above his head. You messed with the wrong kid, nobody touches my stuffed animals. Then he hurled the object. A blur of green soared toward Phlegmdraketoo fast for him to dodge. When it struck the monster, it blasted him back against the wall, and he too, became a splash of shade. With tormented cries, two pairs of glowing eyes, red, and yellow, dashed back beneath the bed and disappeared into the world of darkness, returning to Underbed empty-handed, hurt, and humiliated by the boy who fears no shadows."
Wet paint and gold lettering,"Routine never fails to surprise. A peck on my soft cheek lays a wet parting gift as my mother trips out our brightly painted door. The sunshine yellow now starting to peel and twist into wrinkles at its edge, justifying our impulsive stroke of competence of suddenly knowing how to paint weathered hardware. A hand flies into the crack of the closing door as a last wave before escaping the jaws, snapping back into the doorframe. I stand once again in stillness, eyeing the two hands printed on the door face with craft paint signing our existence. My right hand still lingering with the sensation of red paint, foreign and heavy, bringing upon a compulsive need to touch everything around me so they too can feel such bliss.Oh no darling come back here, don't drip it everywhere it will ruin the floors. Quickly while its still wet. Here, ready, give the door a high five with me. My mother guides my arm up, i place my hand on the fading print reaching its fingers just below my new ones. Releasing the connection, they both remain dry whilst my hand sits at my side wet, rubbing off the red paint onto my pants. The muffled world taunts and teases, whispering between themselves, occasionally singing out and knocking on the windows. The kitchen echos its light as it spills into the hall behind me, opening up the morning again with mother returning to the world at waking times, and finding use of the holidays by myself. Since turning ten, I can now view the various memories that play out on the walls at a comfortable level. Stationary until I provide the stories, the photographs speak and reach out, calling for more screen time as they encourage me to remember more.A purple frame holds our family. The family that i do not see much of anymore. I stand and watch as the nuclear gathering of six, three generations shuffle in place guided by someone beyond the camera. The conductor steers them in place, so all of them are visible with an aesthetic nature that blesses the moment. Grandma watches in the centre, sitting below while the others scatter around. On her lap I sit restless, uncomfortable as her thin arms wire around me to attempt to settle me. Satisfaction slows everyone to a statue, my father and gorgeous mother, a distant cousin seen only once after then, aunty Jude holding grandma's shoulder. I hold thumbs up to the photograph and they all smile wide momentarily. The family drops back down their strung emotion after the click of the camera and everyone retreats to opposite ways. The baby is gifted off to the mother and the chair is left to sit forever stuck in the moment.Below in a smaller frame, one decorated with cheap flower embroidery, a puppy turns on its back, slapping its tail on the floor. Dry slobber mixes with fresh excitement as it fishes for attention with his dopey eyes. I see my reflection in the black beads, and am met with a yap that shakes me out of a lull.Snoop!, i sing loudly to the dog. He jumps back to attention at his call. A lopsided grin as he yaps again sends me into a small giggle. I hop into a wave, matching his playful mood.Hey buddy! Hey, hi!, I find myself calling out in response to his barking as we jump around in circles, stopping and staring at each other before turning and running again. He runs under my feet, causing a quick jump out of his way, landing on my heels falling back into the wall behind me. My laughter catches in my throat as I'm winded from the surprise. Scrunching my face up in anticipation of being met with a tongue coating my pain with puppy breath, I stay dry and gasping for air.Pup?. I open my eyes to no answer and watch the small flowery frame above me, holding a photo of the old houses worn and discoloured carpet, the fraying tassels being centre focus. In the kitchen I slip bread into the toaster and set the time to the line mother marked in sharpie to save any more tears over burnt toast. The butter sits next to the Nutella on the island table behind me, I move them over to my working space in front of me and grab my favourite plate and matching knife from the drying rack. With time to spare I do laps around the kitchen, counting how many I can get before the toast rings ready. No running because that is cheating, I mustnt stop because that will ruin it. The toast flags a total of Six and the small side of the table laps. I coat my breakfast in its clothes and sit at the front window table, only big enough for mother and I. The Nutella melted slightly on the toast sticks to my mouth as I bit into it, attempting to lick it off only resulted in more chocolate spread everywhere.A bin slams closed outside on the street and two ladies walk back to the centre of the path to continue on their way. Their legs march in time, bobbing their heads to the beat I'm giving them with my hand drumming the plastic table. Both wearing dresses like the ones I designed in my drawing book, only more layers of other different colours and shapes. Matching bags hang from their arms resembling those that presents are hidden in. Their destination must be a birthday party, a grand one that balloons hang from the doorframe of all different colours, with a big cake that has the special person's name iced on in gold lettering. The party must be so big, maybe theres room for everyone. I run back over to the countertop in the kitchen where mother puts the mail we get over the week. I shuffle through them and look for the fancy gold lettering, or maybe even a bright sticker that seals it all together. No luck.I run back over to the window and look further down the street where they kept walking. Nearing the end of our road they pass the green pizza place with the extra cheese that sticks to the box. The neon light on the window flashing an unbelievable colour of pink shouts that it's open. In the window a man sits watching the street like me. The reflection of the world and its chaos slightly tinting my ability to see him properly. I mirror his position, placing my head in my hands, resting my elbows on the table. I shift in my seat to help myself get comfortable in the slumped posture but it still feels weird. I watch him while he watches the cars absently. Im sure it's the homework that has him wound up in such deep thought. The teachers always give the harder questions to you for your parents to deal with at home. It must be very advanced given his age but im sure he can figure it out, maybe i could go and give him my revision sheets from my recent multiplication test. It would have to be maths because of how hard he is thinking. He takes a bite of his pizza and is now looking down, maybe hes found the answer! Yes that must be it because he's up from the table now and has disappeared from the window. I blindly feel for my plate next to me and grab my breakfast. My toast is now cold.I retreat back to my bedroom to finish the circus show that was parading around town, starring pooh the biggest bear to ever live, whilst the gymnast barbie shows the great lengths that her joints can be pushed to. The audience will have the collective favourite of the purple lizard that can jump through every shape imaginable. The light outside cools the house as the sun disappears behind the neighbouring buildings, casting a shadow through my window. Downstairs the news echos from the tv. The monotone voice, simplifying the world's chaos and mysterys, also alarms the time in which mother will return home. I run back downstairs.The world knocks again on our yellow door, shifting it open as it peeks in. Mother returns with a breath of fresh air. I pad over to the kitchen door to watch her peel off her shoes and place them facing towards her ready for tomorrow's adventures. Seeing me, she calls into a hug. Through the embrace I feel the movement of a sigh running from her body into mine, a habit Ive grown fond of, matching the rhythm of her breathing, struggling to keep up after the initial few rounds as my lung capacity forces me to gasp at a pace faster, breaking our unison. The moment is broken as her heel placed by the door falls from its statue form. A pat on the back serving a signal of content with the embrace and we head into the kitchen. My sticky feet slapping the furnished floors disturb the silence as mother glides in front of me with socks slightly faded at the heels. I take my place at the kitchen island as she unpacks various snacks left uneaten from her day bag. I smile at the slight rattle of the resin keychain attached to the front, alien in appearance to the formality of the bag. A rattle that matches the one that hangs from my school bag, resin now worn and tugged at, the cartoon picture now unrecognisable. I'm sure all her friends at work gather around in awe, holding out other colourful objects begging to trade, much like my friends do. Im sure she tells them its forbidden because it's a gift from me, much like I say to those who were now doubling the offers. The fridge door shuts and she moves over to flick on the lights that hang over us, given this warning i slightly shut my eyes waiting to open them to slowly adjust to the artificial lighting. She returns to the table and shuffles around cooking tools.How was your day mum?, asking in a joyful tone to break the silence. She looks up to me and for a moment i felt there wasnt going to be an answer before breaking into a smile,work? Oh, it was wonderful! I cant wait to wake up and do it all again tomorrow, and every time after that until I can no longer stand.With that she returns to the carrots, cutting them into fine pieces, continuing on the conversation with a simple tone. Her voice echoing in our small apartment blocks out the world whispering and inviting itself to sneak in every crack and crevice of our house. Mother said her day was wonderful out in that big world, yet she still returns back to me. I cant wait to grow older and follow her ways of working. I will share the worlds mysteries amongst grand parties, homework with pizza, i will find the chair lost in the room and sit with my family, the puppy can sit on my lap, and I will whisper with the world too."
A Metaphor,"Leaves wisp by in a crescendo, swirling and dancing through the cool evening air. Far removed from any city or town sits a train station. This is the station at the end of the line. Countless tracks lead into its terminals, and only one leads out. No one knows how to get there or even how they got there, but everyone ends up there. The platform is empty except for a small boy sitting on a bench accompanied only by the dancing leaves. He is counting the bricks, one by one, that are interwoven amongst the platform. The leaves whirl around his ankles and tickle his calves. The boy giggles and smiles with the sincerity that only an innocent child can espouse. No one is around to hear it, but it brings life to the deadness surrounding the train station. As if the leaves can understand him, the boy asks if they know when the next train will arrive. The leaves begin to waltz down the platform as if to invite the young boy to join in their dance.	The boy hops off the wooden bench with delight and hurries after the leaves as fast as his wee legs allow. He pitter-patters along, in awe of the train station, as if he is taking it in again for the first time. He jumps from brick to brick like a frog jumping between lilypads. The boy doesn't remember how long he has been at the station; it could be minutes, hours, days, or months. The boy is unbothered. He used to dread and worry about being left on the platform, but now he finds joy. The boy loves welcoming travelers from incoming trains. He guides them along the immaculate brickwork of the platform, up the stairs, and into the glowing lantern of the station before they are sent off on their final ride. Countless trains in and only one train out for the station at the end of the line. A distant whistle blares, and a plume of smoke can be seen far down the railway as a new train is about to enter the station.	As the train approaches, the station seems to come to life. The lights illuminate with a comforting glow like a hug from a lifelong friend. The station atop the steps begins revolving its doors, and a clock chimes from far away. The leaves become a vibrant pallet of autumn dancing about, creating a mosaic of fall colors. It is signaling an end and a beginning. The boy runs around, arms stretched wide, pretending to fly like an airplane as the train hums into the station letting out a final hiss to announce the end of its journey. The doors slide open like velvet curtains on a broadway stage, and the ticket masters emerge from every door in a synchronized fashion from the caboose to the engine. Dressed in red and black with shiny golden buttons glistening in the station lamps, they simultaneously check their pocket watches to confirm they are right on schedule. Then, one by one, passengers of all shapes and sizes, from people to pets, begin to exit the train. The pets are the boy's favorite part whenever he can sneak in a quick scratch behind a dog's ear or under a cat's chin. The boy waves and smiles at the passengers as they disembark from the train. The passengers reflect the boys happiness as they all funnel towards the station with the revolving doors at the top of the steps. Without direction, the passengers all know where they need to go. In no rush, in an orderly fashion, they enter the station, tickets in hand, to take the final train to the stop at the end of the line. It is unclear to everyone how much time has passed since the train arrived, the passengers unloaded, and everyone entered the train station. The boy has returned to his seat on the wooden bench, swinging his feet into space as he awaits for one final passenger to exit the train.	The boy waits and watches patiently as the hands of the train station clock make another round. He's lost count of how many revolutions they have made. Like a spinning top that never falters, the hands pass from twelve to twelve. The boy is lost in hypnosis from the clock hands. The leaves stir at his feet again alerting him that the final passenger is emerging from the train.	A woman timidly pokes her head out of the third car from the caboose. She is wearing a beige sweater, blue jeans, and white sneakers. She is in her mid-forties with auburn hair. Her deep brown eyes glisten in the train stations glow illuminating wisdom beyond her years. She looks from one end of the deserted platform to another, at a loss as to how she arrived here. The platform seems to extend indefinitely from either end as she gazes into the abyss expecting to see something that will never be there. Finally, her gaze meets that of a small boy swinging his legs beneath him on a wooden bench, waving her down and smiling at her. She senses an air of familiarity with this boy, although she doesn't recognize him. She takes a shaky breath, gives her ticket to the ticket master for the third car from the caboose, and puts one foot in front of the other to exit the train. As soon as she has left the train, the ticket masters return to their cars; the train exudes a final choo-choo and rolls back in the direction it came. Step by step, she approaches the young boy on the wooden bench with his swinging legs. She doesn't know what else to do and sits next to the boy on his wooden bench. The boy just sits and smiles, looking off into the distance.	The woman finally speaks, ""Excuse me,"" her voice is shaky and uncertain, ""young man can you tell me where we are? I don't remember much besides waking up on an empty train car.""	The boy chuckles as wholesome as a homemade loaf of bread and replies, ""There is always one, every train, there is always one, and it just so happens to be you. A person who feels resistant to the last stop of the line. That is okay though, you can take as much time as you need."" 	""I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure I understand,"" said the woman. ""What do I need time for? What is this place? I don't think I can go back where I came from but I don't know where to go from here.""	""Ahh,"" said the boy in a ponderous state, ""What you need time for, I cannot say; most people just disembark from that train, enter the station at the top of those stairs, and take the last train. As to where this place is, I am not exactly sure that is the right question to ask. The only way left for you to go is towards the station, in due time though, whenever you are ready. May I ask you something, how do I appear to you?""	The woman looked more puzzled than before she had asked her questions. ""What do you mean how do you appear, don't you know what you look like young man?""	The boy smiles again, ""Yes and no, I appear however you need me to appear. I have been many things: a man, a woman, a young girl, a dog, and a cat. But I am always here for those who need a little more time, right here, upon this bench amongst the dancing leaves. Do I look familiar to you? Any names or thoughts come to mind?""	The woman has more questions than answers but is reconciling, calming, and relaxing. ""You do look familiar like someone who may have been but never actually was. I feel like I need to walk up those steps but I don't know what will happen after and it frightens yet also excites me a little. I wish I had answers to more of my questions. Would you happen to know what I may be asking young man? Also, may I call you something, is Garth an okay name for you?""	""Certainly, Garth works just fine, miss,"" The boy responded with an endearing smile that only a child can give. As to your questions, those are a tad tricky to answer. No one knows what happens, where you go, or what becomes of you."" The boy gave another laugh. ""That is where the excitement and fright come hand in hand, I am afraid. You can no longer board the train you just departed from you, even if it did come back. But, there is one more train through that station that can take you wherever you are meant to go. I know it is scary, and it goes to the end of this line, but who's to say there isn't more at the end destination or even if there is an end destination? It could be a ride to oblivion, a ride back to the beginning, or anything in between. I can't give you the answers because I don't know them, and no one ever will, probably. Those answers await you and only you whenever you feel the time is right."" Garth jumped from the bench and extended a hand, ""I can walk with you up the steps to the station if you like?""	The woman didn't understand what was happening, but she knew it didn't matter. The time she needed had passed, and she felt resolved about entering the station. She stood and grabbed Garth's hand with a smile that he returned in earnest. They both took one step after another up the stairs to the station. They could have climbed those stairs for a minute or years, but it didn't matter anymore. The woman and Garth were approaching the revolving doors. They heard a distant yet familiar train whistle somewhere on the other side.	""Sounds like your train is here, miss."" Garth asked, ""Anything else I can do for you before we part ways?""	The woman wavered and thought, pondering as she began to enter the revolving doors. ""Are you sure you don't know where we are and what this is, Garth?""	""Still a bit hung up on unanswerable questions, I see."" Garth chuckled and responded, ""This is nothing more than a metaphor, miss. As to where we are, I think it is quite obvious, we are at a train station."""
The fairytale book,"The pages from the book were pressing hard on me from above and made it difficult to breathe. I did not know how much time had passed. Perhaps a week since Dan picked the book up to read. Or a month. Or a whole year. When no one reads the story you are in for a long time, the sense of time disappears. Sometimes slow steps came from the room. Dans grandmother would enter the room to dust off the shelves or to watch the TV. Shed sit there quietly with the lowest volume set on the TV so that she could hear the rest of the family come home. Then shed join them in the kitchen and it would become too quiet again. Being alone in the room was even more daunting then being alone in a book.The book was a childrens fairytale. On the page seven lived tigers. They wouldnt eat me or kill me. But they could leave bad scratches or bites which would hurt for a long time. The tigers prevented me from seeing my friends. All of them lived on the other side from the tigers. My closest friend, The Talking Tower lived on page twelve. She was very hard to be around as she was 600-years old and would judge everything and everyone around. But now I found talking to her was better than talking to myself in my mind. Having pondered about my decision I chose to risk and to visit the Talking Tower. Quietly I turned over the page and went to the next one. Then I skipped several pages. There were just pictures that were supposed to look like us but none of them did. They drew me as a yellow pony with a brown tail when in reality my tail was pinkish. The writer created me this way. But forgot to mention it in the book, so here I went. The characters saw my pinkish tail, but the readers would assume it was brown. Or they just didnt pay attention to small things like that.The family of the rabbits were wearing t-shirts and shorts in the picture. But they never wore any clothes as it was always too hot in their house. None of the pictures looked like the reality and I hurried to get to the Talking Tower. luckily, the tigers were taking a nap and I walked passed them unnoticed.-dont start yelling. I know you are bored and old and want to nag at everyone around-said I.But the Tower didnt respond. I stepped closer to her and looked up. She looked sad and the window-sills which were supposed to be her eyebrows were crooked downwards.-whats wrong? -I started getting worried.-I feel that I dont have much Left-It was unsettling to hear her usually loud voice be so weak.-there are towers that are much older than you, I heard of a tower who is 1200 years old-you do forget basic things.-what?-we are book characters, and we are immortal-then why are you saying-started I, but she interrupted me.-as long as someone reads us and remembers. -finished the Tower.Suddenly I regretted coming here. Not knowing the sad truth would be easier. Characters would disappear one by one and the pages would turn white. Even the tigers would disappear. Then I would be the last one to disappear too, as the story begins with me. What will I do when everything I knew since the beginning ends and I am left alone? What will happen to me after I disappear? Will it be a death like humans experience or will I just forget everything and wake up as a new character in a different story? Since we are fictional, will we go to fictional hell and heaven?My very first memory was still with me. I was invisible for a few minutes. The writer was creating me in front of me. I still cant remember what she looked like. But she wore thick glasses and had very curly hair. Suddenly I grew four dog legs and large years.-Ok, youll be a dogcame a voice. I looked at the writer, but she wasnt speaking. Apparently, those were her thoughts.-nooo-yelled I. Make me a nice pony, I want to gallop through the book.I didnt hear myself, but she suddenly stopped typing. Then took off her glasses, wiped them and put them back on again.I saw my paws turn into a pony legs and laughed.-and I want a pink tail. Make my tail pink-asked I.Not now, stop bothering me or Ill forget the names of the Rabbits' Family. -stop thinking so hard -the Talking Tower seemed irritated. -and look behind me.Behind the Talking Tower there was nothing. Just white emptiness. Everyone else disappeared and now me, The Tower, and the tigers were the only ones left.-we have to make someone read the book! -screamed I.-they forgot about us. All the kids do nowadays is just play on their stupid what are they called? Temefoles?-the Tower seemed to get her bad temper back.-not now! I have a plan.Luckily, the Tower was big and heavy enough. If she managed to shake the book and make it drop, someone from the family would eventually remember and read it.I ran to the side of the page and pushed hard to make the book fall. It took some time, but we succeeded and it fell with a loud thud. The tower hit me when we were falling and hurt my leg but I forgot about the pain as soon as I heard the steps running to the noise.-oh wow! Your book fell, Dan-came the Moms voice. Ill read it to you tonight before bed.We let out the biggest cheers but of course no one heard us.Later that evening, the Mom opened the first page. She saw the black text on the white page and started reading out loud, making the list of groceries she needs to buy tomorrow in her mind at the same time. But her son immediately saw me and cheered. I jumped from the joy. His mom turned the page and continued reading as Dan watched me gallop through the book to meet the tigers, the Talking Tower, and the Rabbits family."
The Good Worst Choice,"I stood there. Knowing the consequences, I still stood. Not moving anything but my mind... but even that was almost still. I am numbing myself from reality. If I choose, I will be held responsible. How can I? How can I hold myself high with confidence when the weight of a decision is pulling me down?I cannot choose to throw away what is good. But am I even choosing to throw it away? Or am I preserving it?We are given opportunities to change and with those opportunities, it almost always seems that the chances are to be hoped for, but what if the opportunity is good enough that it can make it bad? I am faced with that: the good worst choice.If I have to make my future, I should make it a fulfilled and steadfast one.If I have to let fate make my future, I should live it freely.If I choose to believe I am preserving some parts of my future life, then the answer is clear: I can do what is surely good. The good that is reliable, that isn't settling. I can always have new interests and therefore new options, this might be even better than what I am narrowing my vision to right now.I can choose, as long as I have support. But the ones who offer support to go, do it without any understanding. Because of this, unfortunately, they are not to be trusted in my mind and also in the minds of the others. These ""others"" are the ones who support their  of me leaving this platform, meaning they support the life I have. I am grateful for both, but doesn't it seem a little obvious what the answer should be? To take the risk to live a life outside of what is already known? To not be stuck, right?To be stuck, just for a little while, could further the height I could jump in this But what am I missing, what am I not living?The dream I am pursuing is a dream to everyone outside of my head, but it is a reality to my conscientious carefree, independent mind. Why should I let that go... when I am given chance?I am still standing. Only a couple of breaths have gone by, unlike the dozens of the established decisions that the people have while passing me by. They walk with their disposition to the platform. They move with the procedure. But I saw that some did not. Some hesitate. But not like me. I am stuck. They have come here already knowing, even if they want to say they were unsure. I am stagnant. Unable to help myself.This hurts to decide. It might hurt me to fail. It might hurt others for thinking that they should save me from failing. Why should it be their burden that in turn becomes mine? Why should I feel the anxiousness of their anxiety?I could go, it doesn't matter where. I could physically be right next door, but it would still be a change. Would they still feel as anxious? I know they would. (Is this me feeling trapped?). Or is that still just my presumption? I could avoid those who I live with on a regular basis and not too many words are spoken about how they want to see me. But, suddenly if I were to still not be physically in front of them, it only becomes a problem when there can be no immediate return for them. If I couldn't come back with just a casual invitation. Them saying, ""When you come home, grab some groceries."" That sentence will no longer be their reality. They can't. Is this what scares them? I know to a degree it's what I want. I want to be cared for without the obligations of a short distance. Is this selfish of me?It's like Schrodinger's cat. They don't know what they don't see. And that scares them... but it doesn't when I am in a certain radius? How could I relieve them of this? I don't think I can. How can I accommodate the feelings of everyone? Can I? I could try. Should I?Still frozen in thought, this is still what is racing through my mind. One decision fighting the other to the finish line. But remember... this is a timed race. I know I cannot make this decision on adrenaline without any regard to what I have just thought... so let me think some more. Let's speed this up.I will do it. I will hope. I will strive. I will... I will... I will... fail?I can't. I won't. I will be safe where I am. I am still happy... right?But it  be better! I could see what those around me had not. I could hear and feel and taste what they have not. I want to go!...But... If I leave, even for a short while, I might be missing what I have right in front of me. I would miss the education which could take me places even higher. I would miss the people around me experiencing new things. I would be excluding them from my life, even for that short while. What if a man I am supposed to marry is only a city away from home but I missed the chance to meet him? What if I miss the opportunities to deeply route myself into the culture around me?...But... what if I meet that man while I am away? Would I find the different cultures which accepted me deeply? I could always be in the lives of those who care, simply because of the fact they care. Do you need to be with those people physically? Or does it matter more to have unconditional support? I should test my limits. It might test theirs, but it is my choice, right? Or is it yours, Fate?I have understood at this point.Knowing the chances, knowing the consequences...I took my step forward......then the train passedThank you for reading this. I'm sorry if there are any grammar or spelling mistakes. I know that my computer sometimes puts random periods. But Anyways, I am a new writer. I am here with. the purpose to explore the unconscious side of me and wow. This is my real situation and I really don't know how to make this decision. If some of you have any opinions about what I should do in the character's situation, then please tell me. Also, I want to know if the ending was clear. I don't want there to be a definite ending. The character makes a decision and it is not clear if they had missed the train or had taken the step onto it while it left. I want to know from more experienced writers if I conveyed this correctly."
From a childs mind,"The ominous click of the door sealing shut was always the beginning. And Peyton hates it. This is when the monster comes Every night.First, that creepy loud click; then the dark inky shadows creep closer and closer to his bed.He jerked his soft blue flannel blanket over his head and squeezes his eyes tightly shut.Peyton quietly told himself as he repeats what his mommy and daddy told him the night before. And he did believe them, he really did! It was just so hard to remember mommys brave words when that door, that huge dark heavy door, closed, Peyton frustratedly thought to himself.He slowly lowered his blanket, which was currently also his impenetrable shield, so that his round deep brown eyes could peer into the solid darkness of the room. As his eyes slowly adjust , he watched the prismatic red, blue and green light shadows, from his cool new Halloween strobe light, dance across his walls. It was mommys idea to help him be a big boy and sleep in his own room at night. But he didnt have too, he reminded himself emphatically.if it is ever so scary that he cant take it , then mommy said he can come in her room., he thought stubbornly to himself, as he let his small lower lip pout slightly.Even if daddy was a big meanie and said Peyton mimicked as he scrunched his small face., he proudly thought as he contemplated if he should head to mommys room.!, he thought as a small shiver ran down his spine.He slowly lowered his protective blanket past the waist of his soft cotton Spider-Man pajamas and wiggled onto his belly to peer over the edge of his full sized bed, his soft brown curls tumbling ontohis forehead as his head hung over the edge.. Peyton whispers as he tentatively lowered his small feet to the ground then paused cautiously to take another calculated look at his gigantic bedroom. The kaleidoscope of colors continue to make slow methodical circles around the room occasionally reflecting off the random shiny toy left on his floor. Then he saw it! The answer to his problem;! He squeals to himself!It would protect him till he could make it to his mommies room. But he had to get to his Spider-Man and it is sitting next to his dresser across his room. Peyton groans as he realizes this monumental feat. This is going to require him to get onto the floor AND get to the dresser to get spidey BEFORE the stupid monster got his foot! It just wasnt fair. Why wouldnt mommy just leave the door open and the light on. Peyton mimics as he remembers what his mommy told him before she closed that huge door .Peyton glanced again at the lone Spider-Man toy and began to plan the safest path to the doll.Peyton quietly instructs himself as he lets the kaleidoscope light illuminate his path, Peyton announces in an exciting whisper.Peyton grins to himself as he delicately begins tippy toeing the first part of his perilous journey. Another small shiver works its way down his narrow shoulders as the chill from the hardwood floors began seeping into his small bare feet.. He exclaims as spideys soft red and blue fabric attire draws nearer.His small fingers swiftly secure the dolls soft fabric arm and clutches the toy to his chest with a sign of relief.Peyton whispers as he begins tippy toeing towards his basket of nerf guns.Peyton meticulously counted the way him and daddy practiced earlier.Peyton celebrates as his body performs his fortnight dance with fluent ease, ending with an elaborate dab.His small face crumbles into a fit of giggles as his slight frame doubled over in laughter.Once composing himself, And feeling quite confident since making it this far successfully, Peyton proceeded to gently place one foot solidly on top of his basket of guns followed by the next foot; each gingerly progressing him to his destination, the door. One hand firmly pressed against the wall and the other hand perilously clutches Spider-Mans arm as his feet inch forward.Suddenly there is a low whining groan followed by the collapse of the nerf gun pile.A startled gasp barely escapes his mouth before Peyton tumbles off the top of the nerf guns and lands sprawling out on his hardwood floor. Every muscle in his tiny body froze as he realizes where he is and how perilous his situation was.Peyton assesses as his tiny hand feels along the grooved wooden floor to find his toy. Once he felt the reassuring soft fabric of Spider-Mans arm, he looks around to see what his next move is. As his curious brown eyes look around, he discovers that his situation has gotten worse.Peyton whispers in horror as he looks at his right bare foot that is millimeters from black spikey hair poking out from under the bed.Peyton screams as he channels his inner sonic the hedgehog and races to his mommys bedroom.With one swift turn of the cold brass knob, a strategic jump into mommy and daddys huge king size bed and heavy sigh of relief; he is finally safe.Peyton smiles to himself as he cuddles into his mommys warm soft back.Daddy says in that unpropitious tone that Peyton dreads.Peyton passionately explains.Daddy logically decidesPeyton groans emphatically as Daddy lets him climb onto his back for a piggy back ride to Peytons room.Daddy asks sympathetically.Peyton answers matter of factly. Daddy encourages softly as he turn the smooth brass knob and flicks on the light illuminating all of Peytons superhero wall decor; Spider-Man posters, Hulk figurines, Captain America plaques , sonic the hedgehog fat head poster; all of Peytons favorite heroes.Daddy reassures as he ruffles Peytons soft curly hair.the pair both squat down to their hands and knees and peer expectantly under Peytons bed.Peyton stoically nodded as he firmly grips Daddys warm hand.Daddy warmly confirms as they both lower their heads and discover the monster under the bed.eyton squeals as he burst into uncontrollable giggles."
The Visit,"The candle on the bedside table flickered briefly. Afraid of the dark since a small child, I could not find the solace of sleep without the security of light. 	Oh no, please do not go out! I pleaded terrified of waking alone and defenceless in darkness. I sat up in bed to check if the candle needed replacing. It did not. Only half consumed, its flame burned steadily as if recognizing how much I needed its comfort. 	Thank you. I breathed. Neck muscles relaxed as relief flooded through me. I watched the candle flame grow brighter mesmerising me. I shook my head to escape its power and as I did so on the wall behind the bedside table, a shadow crept up from the floor spreading like an evil genie as it reached the top of the wall angling across the ceiling until it loomed over me. Blinking to clear my eyes of the fog of sleep. The room temperature suddenly dropped. Shivering uncontrollably from cold or dread, the hair on the back of my neck bristled as I tried to reconcile reality and logic with fantasy and fear. Puzzled I asked myself 	How can this be? There is nothing behind the candle flame to cast such a shadow! And it cannot be mine even though in my current state of alarm I might be afraid of it.	Too terrified to turn round, I shut my eyes tightly, listening intently for the slightest sound which might betray a presence in the room which remained as silent as a windless desert or a Pharoahs undiscovered tomb. I opened my eyes to see the shadow change shape from a looming genie to a crouching succubus come to seduce and drain me of my bodily fluids. Soft breath blew on my ear making my body quiver. Fingers feather soft stroked my chest tracing their way towards my lower body. Unable to resist I turned to face my phantom lover.	Instead of a beautiful ethereal woman, a handsome man sat on the bed looking down at me. Striking in a military officer kind of way, dressed in a smart blazer with shiny gold buttons, a striped regimental tie and white shirt. His sandy hair greying at the temples cut short above his ears gave him a distinguished look. Well groomed and attractive in a George Clooney kind of way. 	I come in many forms, it said, blue eyes bright.	Its left eye grew larger as if under a magnifying glass and zoomed in on mine. I could see a large bird like an eagle or a vulture flapping towards me from the center of this eyes pupil appearing to get larger but only because it was dragging me inexorably into its depths. I did not have strength to fight against it as relentlessly it my soul consumed. Transfixed, hopeless and helpless in its thrall, it dragged me to the abyss and an endless fall. A silent scream of terror choked my throat. My body levitated from the bed, hovered like a hunting kestrel, plunged down and bounced back up again to float for two seconds before tumbling down again filling me with dread. Each bounce lifted me like a tiny boat beneath a surging tsunami. Ahead and over, waiting to pitchfork to hell swamped by a mountainous, steepling swell.	Then a black void swallowed me whole like a shark devouring a hapless, miniscule fish. My body hurtled from day into dark arms locked against ears, sensing the slick swish of clothes swirling and thrashing through slippery seaweed as stark dread compelled me to make a death wish pulse racing, nostrils flared, eyes screwed tight shut, bowels loosened by the fear in my gut. I plunged for what seemed a lifetime before I blacked out. Beyond caring as if dead to the core deprived of feelings like a mindless lout destroys for fun or swept ashore like surfers shattered in a last wipe-out. 	Awakening in pitch blackness, I found myself in a cavern standing in a silence profound. Nothing stirred in the stillness of that place. A strange smell suffused the air like the incense used in a great cathedral to replace the smell of the poor to give no offence to God in prayers and in case the scented rich complained. Still in suspense, I stretched out a trembling hand to feel my way hoping for that which might allay my fears. Nothing. Darkness wrapped round me like a shroud. 	Am I blind? I asked myself as my appeals for help echoed mockingly in emptiness.	My pleas decreased in volume as hope evaporated and the walls of the cavern closed in tight around me. Clarity returned and rational thought allowed logic to replace fear. Devoid of panic, I assessed my situation: was I trapped between heaven and hell, in limbo, or the bottom of a well? Looking up, I glimpsed a circle of light as though through the wrong end of a telescope. Stars flickered there sometimes dim, oft times bright. Obviously, I wasnt dead nor devoid of hope because I could breathe and possessed good sight. But how to reach those stars without a rope or means of climbing up to them? If in limbo, I would be powerless to escape but if I were at the bottom of a dry well or bottle dungeon an exit might be possible if I could conceive of a way to do it.	If a well, it might be made of bricks to offer foot or toe holds to climb up on.	Reaching out I felt not brick but a smooth surface of concrete. Tracking round a circular wall my hands encountered a metal ladder bolted into it. I tentatively place one foot on the first rung followed by the other. which proved to hold my weight. Just as I reached the top of the ladder a heavy access hole cover crashed down sealing the exit and narrowly missing my fingers. I lost my balance and fell backwards into the void once more but this time swept inexorably to the edge of a horrifying waterfall and tumbling helplessly like a rag in a washing machine plummeting down and landing on my bed which had turned into a terrifying trampoline. Tossed and thrown, all seemed lost until a small quiet voice whispered in my ear, 	Say the Lords Prayer.which in my naive youth I might have rejoiced to do but in aged disbelief I did not dare. God forgive me, there was no other choice. But I could not remember the words I swear until they seemed emblazoned on my brow. I recited them more in hope than in belief. Straightway the hideous bouncing lessened and the words vanquished the terror, I know not how, until I lay at peace and slept like a new-born baby."
Fanfare,"What first hit me was the cold. What I first hit was the printer. Daft to leave the tray poking out over the bin everyone was discarding their cupcake cases in.  There were fans on every desk. As well as overhead fans. The flapping of neon post-it notes forming the disco lights of the party. All the windows were wide open, the sounds of gulls and sirens added to the mix of the whirring of the blades and the hens clucking going into overdrive as they welcomed me, the new chick. I would like to say it was all in celebration of my arrival but it was also the retirement of some grizzled team leader I was meeting for the first time that day, then would most likely never see again.  I bent down to pick up the pen Id pretended to drop (actually a move to get brief respite from the line of the hellfire halitosis of the woman training me) and saw there were fans under some of the desks too, pointed groinwards. I felt my own one wince at that vision of its future.  Someone had tuned a dusty radio to a sixties pop hits station. Sensible penny loafers were having their time to shine, tapping on an already threadbare slate grey carpet. I regretted my own choice of black knee high boots with their two and a half inch heels. I had wanted to add a little height to my 5 1 frame. Instead I looked like a slut with a hobble. Thats the last time I rely on the fashion pages of Cosmopolitan magazine.  Enforced fun. The worst kind. I just wanted to get back to my desk. I needed to get in touch with IT to sort out their mistake when they were setting me up with an email address. Its J-O-D-I-E, not J-O-D-Y. Not like I had to send them a million forms with my name spelled as it should be beforehand or anything. Maybe its their idea of fun, when theyre not spying through the webcams.  Someone whose name was Sally or Sarah is exclaiming over my nose ring. Does it hurt? What happens when ya hafta blow yer nose?? You could just hear the double question mark. I was used to it from men on dating apps following up from messages theyd sent milliseconds ago, less so from women I was meeting for the first time in a professional setting. I could tell Sally-or-Sarah was just itching to touch the ring. Id been warned of the Gollums from accounts by a friend whod just left the Trust. I managed to slip away after distracting her by pointing out the dollop of coleslaw adorning her cardigan.  Someone it took me a month to figure out was called Cee-Cee, not Sissy, was fanning herself (the hot flushes, theyre non-stop  never get old, mlovely!) with a patient information leaflet on eating disorders while simultaneously demanding I pile my floppy paper plate high from a beige wobbling pyramid of sausage rolls. On closer inspection of the buffet table I was surprised to find their vegan counterparts. I suppose not having a plant-based option would result in human rights violation emails to HR from the girl I spied with the too short fringe. The shorter the fringe, the shorter the temper, so Ive found. Id be annoyed too if I had been given that haircut. I think because were similar in ages Im expected to gravitate towards her but Id rather be alone with the homemade samosas Id just spotted.  I was about to pocket a handful of After Eights so I could have them later at the designated time the brand creators had in mind but then became ensnared as soon as my fingertips brushed the little square envelopes. I had to pretend to listen to a rare fox among the hens superciliously drone on about the apprenticeship in Information Governance he co-ran. I told him Id like to at least complete my mandatory training first  unfortunately he took that to be a joke, guffawing and spraying cheesy biscuit crumbs. He actually gave me a business card when he got a hold of himself again, as though I couldnt just look him up on the intranet. I caught a couple of the hens twinkling beady eyes at each other. Sorry to disappoint, Sally-or-Sarah and Ann-or-Anita, this isnt the start of some office romance. This is the start of me collecting evidence to tell the Green Team how trees were being killed so Andrew could enjoy the feeling of shoving his face in my palm, given he wouldnt be shoving it anywhere else on me anytime soon.  At least three of the phones are ringing, but nobody is answering. Not when there are snacks. I muffled a sigh. I was there to work. I was there to change things. From the inside. I had experienced all the failings of the healthcare system as a patient, what with years of misdiagnoses since a young girl. The blackouts that were put down to puberty, hormones, not enough exercise, not enough vitamin C in my diet. The mood swings. The constant pain. Being asked all the time and always by a new consultant, never the one Id seen last, if I was taking recreational drugs. I was angry. But I was ready. Id get through this dreary do, fix the fuck up with my name, then I would start to help those in need. Because I knew the wilderness of being knocked off the waiting list for unclear reasons. I knew- A proffered miniature plastic cup of warm orange juice snaps me out of my reverie. The strip lights (the cause of so many of Maureens migraines, lest we forget) shimmer and dance on the surface of the liquid, drawing me forwards. I dive in. So sweet.  A nervous new girl places a lilac coloured envelope on the corner of my desk where Ill read thirty of the same platitudes scrawled inside, or at least try to while the flies and the phones buzz around my decaying carcass, before it goes straight into the recycling bin when I get home:  Happy retirement Jody! Never get old."
Good Luck,"One day while walking through the streets with her skateboard in hand and punk rock playing in her headphones, fourteen year old Kate saw a cat. A black cat with blue eyes. Kate had hyperfixated on and studied cats and knew that it was uncommon for a black cat to have blue eyes. She crouched down and put her hand out. The cat looked at her hand and noticed the small crystal in it. The cat approached closer and took the crystal into his mouth. The cat looked into Kates deep brown eyes and nudged her hand. Kate pet the cats head and kissed his head. She picked up the cat and held him in her arms. Kate stared at the cat and thought of a name, Mochi she said aloud. She placed the cat into her sack and started skating home. Mochi sat contently playing with the crystals in her bag. When she got home she yelled, Mom im home! and continued to her room in the basement. Not to her surprise when she got into her room she was greeted by her boyfriend sitting on her bed, reading. Hi Quinn look what I found. She let Mochi out of her bag and onto her bed. Mochi approached Quinn slowly to sniff his feet. Mochi thinks you have stinky feet. Kate chuckled. Quinns eyes lit up, Mochi? Thats such a cute name! Youre the best girlfriend ever. and he pulled Kate onto the bed and held her in his arms. Kate sighed and wished Mochi and Quinn could stay here forever. She knew sooner or later Mochi would be sent outside again. She held Mochi tight while Quinn kissed her cheeks and neck. She giggled, Quinn stop! I need you to take care of Mochi. Quinn stopped and let go of her. Take care of Mochi? Are you sure? You just found him. Kate raised her eyebrow surprised that her boyfriend would doubt Kates ability to take care of them both. Please Quinn She said while flashing her puppy dog eyes. Alright fine but only because I love you He turned to Mochi and booped his nose, and you too. Kate stood up abruptly and kissed Quinns forehead. Want to go to the store? Kate asked and Quinn nodded and got off Kates bed. Lets blast. said Quinn and he put his shoes on and grabbed Mochi. Kate grabbed her skate board and hopped on. She handed Quinn his skateboard and started skating. Kate! How do I hold Mochi while skating? Kate turned around and said Sorry! Let me grab him so I can put him in my bag. When Kate and Quinn arrived at the pet store the door rung when she walked in and set Mochi on the ground. Quinn started looking at clothes for cats and Kate pulled him over to the food bowls. Which ones do you want? She asked as Quinn browsed the selection. I like this one. He said while pointing to a bowl with cat ears. Cute! Kate said and grabbed one for water and one for food. Do you think he needs a collar? Quinn asked but instead of Kate responding Mochi responded with a mow. Sounds like he does. Kate said. Kate proceeded to grab a crystal out of her bag to give to Mochi but he refused it. Aww cmon Mochi I need you to hold this for me. He hissed and walked away. That was weird. Quinn said while holding a costume for Mochi. Quinn! He might be able to sense good crystals from bad! Kate whispered making sure Mochi couldnt hear. Wow thats bold of you to assume, Kate. Quinn teased. Kate scowled and blushed, I dunno. It seems odd that he has blue eyes. Kate continued. Quinn listened but decided to change the topic. Where  Mochi? Quinn asked and left the aisle. Kate followed while calling Mochis name, Mochi! Mochi! Quinn appear holding Mochi. Got him He said triumphantly. Kate kissed both of them on their heads and proceeded to checkout. A collar, bowls for food and water, cat food, cat bed, cat toy The cashier said while putting the things into a bag. Quinn looked at Kate and she grinned. Hey can I stay at your house tonight? Quinn asked. Taken off guard and blushing Kate replied, Oh uh sure, you can stay in my room Quinn grinned and kissed Kates cheek. Thanks, love. Kate loved it when Quinn called her love.Kate and Quinn stopped by a Vietnamese restaurant and fed Mochi some rice. I think he likes it! Kate said. Maybe hes Filipino like me Quinn grinned like a proud father. The wind was strong outside and it blew the door to the cafe open. Kate jumped to sit closer to Quinn. Haha! Did that scare you? Quinn asked while rubbing Kates hands. Just a bit. I guess im superstitious right now Kate sighed. Superstitious? Kate? No. Never. Quinn said sarcastically. Quinn Im serious I think something might be going on with- Kate glanced at Mochi, Quinn laughed and said Yea I know but just because he turned around when he sniffed one of your crystals doesnt mean he can tell what the energy is like. Kate sighed and gave up, Youre right I was paranoid. Quinn picked up some noodles with chopsticks and put them into his mouth. The cafe had cleared of people and it was just them. Mochi slept on Quinn's backpack with the amethyst attached to his collar. Quinn put his arm around Kate will she stared at her food. Cmon Kaitibug, will you give me a tarot reading later? Kate grunted in agreement and continued to eat. When Kate and Quinn got home they snuck downstairs into Kates room. Kate changed into pajamas and gave Quinn her extra pair. Quinn buried his feet into Kates rug and pet Mochi on his soft head. Kate laid down while Quinn stayed sitting up. The red LED lights made it hard for Quinn to read his book so he laid his head down next to Kates. Mochi crawled over the two and found a spot in the corner of the bed. Kate rested her head onto Quinns chest and thought about what to do with Mochi. She decided that Mochi could stay with her but he would need to come to school with her. Quinn ran his fingers through Kates hair. You know, I believe you there might be something sketchy with Mochi. I mean how is he asleep? He could be cuddling with the cutest girl ever. Kate moved her legs to be on top of Quinn's. Meh I think theres something actually up with him. Kate mumbled. You can tell me all about it tomorrow Quinn said and Kate quickly fell asleep.In the morning Kate woke up sick. With a cold to be specific. Her nose turned a bright crimson red and and her eyes were puffy. Not only could Kate barely breathe through her nose but she also could hardly see. Quinn was still fast asleep in Kates bed when she left to tell her mom that she couldnt go to school. Her mom told her to make some tea and get some rest. Kate went down into her room to see Quinn crying. Quinn! Whats wrong?! Kate exclaimed. Through tears Quinn explained, Over half of your crystals have been chewed up by Mochi!  Kate thought to herself but sure enough they had been destroyed. She looked at the broken crystals and saw that the same crystal that Mochi had turned away was in that pile. Quinn im going back to bedare you going to school today? Quinn shook his head and sat up in the bed. Mochi appeared from out of the closet. Hmmm, theres the crystal killer himself. Mochi meowed and rubbed against a plant. Kate picked up Mochi to look him in his eyes. His eyes, which were originally blue, were turning yellow in certain parts. Quinn look at this, his eyes are turning yellow Quinn picked him up and stared into his eyes. Hey, youre right. Quinn said, Arent black cats to have yellow eyes? Kate ignored the dumb question and went to grab more crystals. She laid them out in a line and had Mochi sniff each of them. Kate was going to test the color of Mochis eyes. She decided that if he crushed a crystal with a bad energy in it the color of his eyes would grow more yellow. Wow, thats my genius girlfriend Quinn stated. Mochi sniffed each of the crystals. There were three that he decided to crumble. To sum it up, Quinn and Kate decided that black cats were sent to get rid of bad and negative spirits and energies.Why do most black cats have yellow eyes?Theyve fulfilled their duty on earth to get rid of evil energies.So if youre filled with negativityPeople might say,Good luck."
Monster Under My Bed,"Monster Under My Bed 	The exact details are hazy. I was in college, my junior or senior year, and it was a creative writing class. We were in the computer lab that day, working on our personal essays, but many of us were stuck. Take a snapshot from your life, our professor told us. Select a good one- a hard one, a happy one. Take your pick. And then write about it. How hard can it be? Behind the glib tone, however, a smile; he was heckling us, and we returned it with equal fervor. Mock fervor; pretend outrage. Our relationship with him was easy, comfortable. An older man, tall and slightly stooped, he occasionally read us the stories hed written himself; and sometimes- ridiculously so, now that I think back on it- hed pass them out for us to read, giant stacks of them, with the option of censored copies (black Sharpie streaked across whole paragraphs); and uncensored ones, rife withI cant remember, exactly. Sexual stuff? Gore? What else could it be? So funny how this professor, teaching a college level class, was so parsimonious, even protective. Sweet, really.	Anyhow, it was with this sense of ease that wed brainstormed out loud, volleying ideas back and forth, our voices clambering over each other. A snapshot then; not the curated sort with placid smiles and stiff postures. Candid ones. Microexpressions of rage or joy; the authentic ones.	With unusual brashness, I announced, At night, my sister used to hide under my bed and grab me. Shed do it almost every night for I thought for a moment. Gosh, for like a year.	This stopped the class. They laughed and grimaced in equal measure. Every night?	Yes, I said, laughing with them. Almost every night. Im not exaggerating.	They asked the obvious question: But wouldnt I expect it, night after night?	I kept my tone light, but the attention made me feel warm; flushed. It wasnt only under my bed. Shed cram herself into my side table. Like really contort herself. Or shed hide behind the clothes hanging in my closet. She once even tried to hide under my mattress, but she couldnt manage it.	But , they asked?	She loved to scare me. It made her laugh. And it always worked. Id scream every time. Id check, of course. Id look under my bed, but I swear, I couldnt see her. And then, my hands reached up and clenched into fists, shed grab me.	Thats crazy, someone said. Your sister was messed up.	And then we moved on. I wrote my essay, and inspired by such a receptive audience, I titled it Monster Under My Bed. A facetious title, as it was all in jest. A prank on a younger sister, an endless loop until she tired of it.	But why now, all these years later, sitting at my computer on a random Saturday afternoon, was I thinking about it now? Why did this memory awaken and move through the corridors of my mind, crystallizing into this thought: That my sister, hiding under my bed, night after night, was indeed ? What provoked it, benign as it was, said by someone I cant remember, a singular discombobulated voice?	Because my sister wasnt the type to be messed up; such a thing was inconceivable. In fact, she was now a proper mom of three. If only my creative writing class could see her now; in fact, they  see her now- in real time; she had, to date, 354,000 followers on her Instagram and even more on the mothership, Youtube. (Or was it the other way around?) At any rate, she was a vlogger of some merit, an influencer of beige playsets, nurseries with muted colors, casually slung swaddlers reminiscent of ancient Mamis, pointed acrylics, a sparkling rock with sliding bands on slender fingers. 	Her husband was a dentist; a decent guy, devoted to college football and beer-soaked bratwurst. He shied away from the camera, but when encountered, he smiled affably, offering token words with his usual good nature; complicit to the narrative of his wife, my sister, a harried mother of two little girls, with their high-pitched voices and adorable hijinks. And yet, on their vlog- Babymoon in Hawaii!- he was, in my opinion, from the eight years Id known him, rather disingenuous. He didnt seem the type towell, hold the camera, only an arm visible, wearing a white linen shirt (when had he ever worn linen?); and my sister, gingerly stepping over rocks, a wispy sheath of white dress, hair flowing behind her, reaching for him, hand extended, laughing, her mouth wide open, rapturously happy. A filter which made it soft around the edges, plaintive music in the background, John Mayer, or perhaps Michael Buble; a husky croon.	The babymoon was seven months ago, the baby having since been delivered. A boy. The vlog- Gender Reveal!- was quite the to-do. You can see me, there in the background, rounder in width than my sisters tight drum of a belly; I was wearing dark jeans and a sensible blouse; she was wearing a dress of indiscriminate color- a sort of urine-colored prairie dress with a simple baby-blue headband; a wink to the viewers of what she really desired. She didnt care, of course, they both didnt care, but shed lean into the camera and whisper intimately to her best friends, aka her viewers, that she really hoped it was a boy. Wink, wink.	Was I a tad bit disappointed when the giant firecracker (or whatever that tubular device was), emitted the blue powder, cloaking everything with its residue? Everyone roared with joy. Even me, I must admit- quite the dopamine hit.	It took me a while, but I found the paper. Some digging was necessary, deep in the bottom drawer of my cherrywood desk. But there it was. I felt the old thrill of seeing the title, Monster Under My Bed, and the professor's faded red pen: .	When I did see him, at his office the next day, he asked if Id sign a waiver form. The university was offering a new online course, and would like, with my permission, to use my personal essay as an example.	I was flattered, dimly wondering if my essay was to serve as a template of terrible writing. I never checked, not wanting an affirmation either way. But reading it again, with the wisdom of years behind me, I discovered that my memory belied me. It wasnt the jocular tone I remembered; it held a bite to it. It was the proof I needed. For what, exactly? I couldnt say. Such a thought hadnt articulated itself, just a deep sense of being wronged.	I took it with me to our next family gathering, which happened to be Thanksgiving at my parents house. Only rarely did my sister vlog there. She also never called to warn me (maintaining that vlogging was best when done spontaneously- although the bigger her daughters bows, and the more aesthetically pleasing her outfit, contradicted this), I took greater care, blowing out my hair and wearing jeans that would inevitably feel constricting.	No bows on the girls. My sister in sweats, sans makeup: thus no vlogging. Was I disappointed? Goodness no. I felt miffed, however, as, once again, it would have been nice to have known beforehand. It was useless to ask my mom, as she took the attitude of come-what-may. She never cared if the house was messy or how frumpy she looked. I dont think she ever watched the vlogs.	The air felt heavy with the smells of turkey; oily and pungent. And there was my sister, sitting on the couch, tiredly nursing her baby. Ben was happily watching football with my dad; he looked relaxed, his scruff longer than what was normally deemed acceptable.	Sitting next to her, I found with increasing annoyance that I could not catch her attention. Every time I started a conversation, shed half-heartedly listen, and then: Emmaline! Dont touch your sister! Or: Addy, go grab the diaper bag for Mommy. And so on.	Finally, after dinner, when my mom offered to give the girls their bath, and during another round of nursing, I thrust it at her. I wrote this about you.	What is this? She looked at it dubiously. You wrote about me?	I tried to sound casual. I just found it going through my things. I wrote it back in college. I couldnt help myself. I added, It was published, you know. Ah, what a simpering fool I was! To downplay such hubris, I quickly said, Obviously, it was forever ago. Not even true. Was an online publication for educational purposes considered published? Hardly a matter to equivocate, as she didnt take notice. What was being published, even to a top literary magazine, in comparison to the shiny jewel of social media?	But why did you write about me?	She took the baby off her nipple, red and shiny, before covering herself- laconically, in my opinion. Id have been mortified.	Just read it, I demanded, which made her look at me in surprise. I grabbed her warm loaf of a baby before she could protest. Ill burp him. She eyed me warily at my fumbling attempts of holding him over my shoulder.	No, she said, not like that, And then a tutorial followed: his body hunched over, his face settling into his multiple chins, staccato-like pats against his back.	I gestured for her to read, and with a sigh she complied, her face slightly pinched. And when she was done, she put the paper face down onto her lap.	It was messed up, right? I said, echoing my classmate, this voice of validation. Hiding under the bed like that?	Yes, Anna, she replied, in a clipped tone. It was. She regarded me evenly.	Bravely I stared back at her. I felt triumphant. My face must have glowed.	She removed the paper from her lap and set it onto the coffee table, and then gestured for me to hand back the baby. With expert deftness, she leaned him forward and patted his back with such efficient swiftness, he promptly belched, loud and reproachful. A viscous bubble grew from his puckered mouth. We both watched until it popped.	So then why did you do it? I pressed. My voice held a challenge. Now that I had an admission, I wanted more: atonement, prostration. But truly, a simple apology would have sufficed.	To my astonishment, she asked primly, What did I do? She used a baby cloth to wipe at his mouth, the popped bubble now forming a drool down his chin.	Hiding under my bed and scaring me like that? It was weird, right? My voice grew in provocation. And remember, youd hide in other places, too.	Well, thats exactly what I want to know, Anna. She let the sentence hang for a moment. Because it was  who scared .	This I wasnt expecting. My body surged with sudden heat. I wanted to strike her. I wanted to erase the smirk from her face. Instead I said the first thing that came to mind. A childish retort. No it wasnt.	She leaned toward me, her baby a shield (her children served as the armor she wore; or perhaps the weapons she wielded; or at the very least, the props), and said, Yes it was, Anna. You were the one who hid under my bed and grabbed my ankles. You were the one that hid in my closet, and you were the one that hid in every corner of my room. I honestly cant believe you would blame it on me.	I shook my head. Now I wanted her to stop. Now I wanted her to shut up. The audacity! This was gaslighting of the worst order. She overused that word on her vlog. So-and-so was  me; but Im too clever; I know my; I have my .	My thoughts skittered. Where was Ben? Hed gone to get diaper cream; my dad was snoring in the living room; my mom, by the sound of it, had finished the bath; the rush of running water through the pipes overhead had stopped.	She continued, It scarred me. Im serious. Even now, when I go to hotels, I have to run and then leap onto the bed, so I dont get too close. So someone doesnt  me from underneath. Ben laughs about it. (How I burned with shame at the image; she and Ben laughing at me.)  were the monster under my bed, Anna. Not me. And then mildly, It was such a stupid thing to do. It wasnt funny at all. I should have told Mom and Dad, but maybe I felt sorry for you. You really seemed to enjoy it.	And with that, she lifted the heft of her baby and walked into the kitchen. She was going to mix her formula with her breast milk for his nightcap; I knew this because it was one of the tips she offered her viewers: How To Make Your Baby Sleep Through The Night!	I sat there, furious.  was the monster? Me? But what could I do? I didnt know how to defend myself. I did not have the arsenal of her words. She was too clever, too malevolent; her verbal acuity would only assail me.	And then Ben came home, and seeing my expression, asked if I was okay.	I smiled weakly at him. Im fine.	I left the couch and wandered aimlessly for a bit. A silly thing to do- wander inside the confines of a house, not take a walk outside where the air was crisp and might offer a little clarity. At some point, I went upstairs to check on my mom and the girls. The bathroom was balmy, thick with the smell of shampoo. Addy was brushing her teeth (just a toothbrush with clear gel, safe for ingesting) while sitting on the porta potty. (My sister would not approve.) My mom was running a comb through Emmalines wet hair. I asked her if she needed any help, but she cheerfully assured me she did not. She had it under control.	Fine by me. The care of toddlers was exhausting. I could only handle them in doses, and to be honest, I hadnt quite found my footing in the role of aunt yet. I told myself that Id do better when they were older; Id be a safe haven, I was sure, when they needed an escape from their mother. Not mom, but 	I felt unsettled, agitated. I found myself wandering the upstairs. Past my parents bedroom. Past the spare bedroom, with a pack n play set up in the corner, a queen-sized bed with the dingy blue quilt. Ben would drive home, as would I, as I only lived a half hour away, but my sister often slept over, she and the girls in the bed, the baby in the portable crib. And why wouldnt she, as my mom never protested her demands, waking up early and doing the lions share of the work. My sister needed her rest, naturally.	Agitated. Up and down the halls. I paced.	And then I paused.	Sudden movement; wildly, impulsively, without thought. I scurried. I slithered. It was tight, tighter than before.		I pressed my face into the carpet to muffle my laughs. Yes. .	Smell cannot betray memory. And while this wasnt the house Id grown up in, wasnt the room, wasnt the bed, there would always be that smell. Slightly chemical, specific to a place that didnt bear the traffic of shoes, of feet, of spills. A place of safety; of darkness, like a womb; a sacred place. Thereunder the bed.	She was right, my sister. How had I forgotten this place? Where no one could see me, invisible as I was, entombed.	I waited, there under the bed. Waited as the springs jounced- heavier from my mom as she read the girls a story, lighter from my nieces, as they rolled to and fro. Tears streamed down my face. I shook with laughter, pressing my face, again and again, into the coarse weave of carpet.	The anticipation, the waiting, oh the sweetness. My body thrummed with hilarity. My mom left. The girls giggled. Addy cried. Emmaline soothed. And I cackled into the carpet.	Finally, finally, she came. All was quiet. I didnt peek, the bedskirt did not quiver. She was murmuring; she was holding the baby. Closer now. Closer.	I pounced."
Stuck,"Stuck 	Dont look under the bed. Mom said and gave me a good night kiss.	Why? I just had to ask.	Your favorite question again. Why, why, why. Well, you might find something you dont want there. Thats why. Good night. Mom left the room with the door slightly opened so I could see the hallway light. Then again in the morning, the light was always off. That spooked me each time when I thought about it.	Now, here is a different situation, I thought.	Why did Mom tell me not to look under the bed? Id never dreamed of looking under the bed if she didnt mention it. Why would I? All I will find are half-broken toys, candy wrappers, or possibly a dead mouse since I havent heard it running through the ceiling.	Curse you, Mom.	I closed my eyes and all I could think of was what was under the bed.	There should be nothing I couldnt imagine.	Oops, I used the I-word.	Imagine.	You can do this. Use your imagination. That was what Mrs. Koncharofsky would say when we had to do any work in the classroom.	What is 7 times 13? Use your imagination. She would say.	If I can imagine the answer, why am I here to learn how to multiply numbers? I should be home imagining what I want for my lunch and what presents Santa Clause should bring to me under the tree.	In time, I was getting sleepy. I should go to bed. After all, I have school tomorrow. I need to save all the imagination for what Mrs. Koncharofsky will ask me in the classroom.	I was ready to go to bed in a second if I didnt hear a cry under the bed.It sounded like a growl. Very light and soft and wimpy growl.	Use your imagination! Mrs. Koncharofskys voice lingered in my head like a doorbell.	I dont want to use my imagination! I shouted in my head.	Fortunately, I could not imagine anything could be under the bed, but unfortunately, I was not sleepy anymore.	I want to sleep! My heart was shouting at me. But my brain said I am wide awake!What shall I do?	Yes, I need to find out what is underneath the bed.	But why? Its probably a cat. We dont have a cat. A puppy? We dont have a puppy either. Does Mom want to surprise me with a new pet? Its a nice thought, but she isnt that kind of a person. Its not my birthday or Christmas. There is no chance of that.	Use your imagination!	Why? Mrs. Koncharofsky? Did you imagine that we need to start calling you by your new last name in the middle of the school year?	Yes, she was Miss Tanaka, and after a Thanksgiving break, she became Mrs. Koncharofsky.	Did you imagine that we had no problem understanding how the marriage system works in the United States? You shouldve kept your last name. Its easier for us to pronounce and you dont even look like one of Koncharofsky.	We all need to accept one another. Thats what she would say. In fact, her husbands first name was Mike. When he proposed to her, she realized that she would become Koncharofsky. She was already in love with him and all, so she said she accepted to become Koncharofsky.	Wait! I dont have time to reminisce about my schoolteachers fond memory of her last name. There is something under the bed!	There was a cry again. This time, it was a bit louder but still sounded frail and weak.	I took a deep breath to brace myself. I crawled onto the floor like a snake and peeked under the bed.	There they were. Two enormous eyes shining like diamonds glared at me. There was a gigantic monster under the bed.	I couldnt see anything else but those eyes. But they were not shined because of the evil power. They were filled with tears.	The monster growled again.	Who are you? I squeezed out my voice to ask that simple question.	Im a monster. His voice was so gentle that I could barely hear.	What are you doing down there?	Im supposed to scare you.	Im kinda scared. Well done, now goodbye.	No, I cant come out of here. Im stuck.	How did it happen?	I am a big monster. I usually use the closet, but there is no closet in your room. So by default, I appear under the bed.	That doesnt make any sense. Dont you know how big youre?	Of course, I do. This is the first time this happened to me. You know everything has the first time.	Yeah, but this is stupid. You know today is a school night, dont you? I have a math quiz tomorrow. And Im not good at math, especially fractions.	Well, I apologize for the inconvenience. But if youre not scared, Ill be stuck here forever. Could you scream a bit?	I cant do that. Mom will be mad at me. Shes the one who told me not to look under the bed. I dont want her to know that I found you there.	You want me to stay here forever?	Frankly, I dont care. I need to go to bed. You know, Mom vacuums every morning. Maybe thats how you can get out of your predicament.	Predica-what?	Predicament.	Whoa, you know a big word.	Dont you know what predicament is? How old are you?	Eight.	Jesus, I am nine. I thought you guys are a lot older than I am. So at eight, you start scaring human kids?	Well, kinda. We practice and need to pass the scaring test. I passed it two weeks ago. This is my second week.	It sounds like youre an adult already.	Well, I am on my own.	Where are your parents?	They are in Florida. They have already retired from scaring kids. They have pina colada and lie down on the beach.	Monsters, too, retire in Florida? Ive never thought that would be possible.	There are a few beaches just for monsters although we cant tell them apart from retired old humans from retired monsters. They all wear Hawaiians or moo moos with sunglasses.	What are moo moos?	It looks like a big pillowcase. Very colorful, though.	Who, I had no idea. We are very much alike to each other.	You know, once, my mom sent me a photo with this humongous head monster in moo moos.	Really?	Well, it wasnt a monster standing next to her. It was an old lady with a towering hairdo. It looks like burning Eifel Tower.	Thats funny.	It was.	Whats wrong?	Im so stupid. I should be scaring you.	Well, but now Im glad youre here. Im getting sleepy with your nice story.	Really? Good to know.	Now Im relaxed and dont even think about the quiz tomorrow.	Fractions, huh? Would that scare you?	No, I just get nervous.	You know what we do when we are nervous?	What do you do?	We imagine the zombies running around with their heads cut off.	Thats funny. We imagine the chickens instead of zombies, but zombies will do, too.	Good. And the monster sighs deeply.	Whats wrong?	I guess Ill be stuck here forever. Dont get me wrong. I am having a great time talking to you.	Now you said that I cant go to sleep thinking about you being stuck there forever.	Sorry.	Just say something a little scary. Then, I scream lightly. Okay?	Okay, lets see. MOO!	Whats that?	Well, if I say BOO, that will surely scare you. I just wanted to scare you slightly.	Have you scared anybody before?	Of course, I have. I told you this is my second week.	What age group?	They are between three to eight.	So, Im your first nine years old.	Yes. Youre still a child, arent you?	Wrong, you are. We nine-year-olds are more sophisticated than those nose-running, underwear-smelling muddy foot scoundrels.	I can see that from your choice of words.	So, you must set up the scene right to scare me. You have some power to do so, dont you? Or do you just scream like a monster?	I am a monster.	So today is a good learning opportunity for you. You have a long career ahead of you as a scarer. You need to improve the technique to scare kids my age.	Okay, Im beginning to feel lucky being stuck here.	Good.	First, you must create an eerie atmosphere. The door closes for no reason. The wind blows in and splatters the curtains.	I cant do that. I dont have those powers.	What do you have?	I have large shiny eyes with pointy sharp teeth.	Thats scary. Good. What else?	I can do a voice.	You mean, you can sound like someone else?	Yes. Ahem We all love China, China, China, Lets make America even greater again.	Are you sure youre here to scare kids?	I saw that on TV the other day in a kids bedroom. She left a TV on.	Who else can you do?	Lets see Come down here, Samuel Moses Anderson! Right this second!	I screamed! The monster sounded just like Mom.	The door opened. There stood Mom.	What happened?	Nothing.	Nothing?	Did you peak under the bed?Mom smiled. 	Of course, not.I looked away from her.	Okay. Do you want me to stay until you fall asleep?	No. Im too sophisticated for that.	How about this? Mom kissed me on my cheek.	Good night, Mom.	Good night.	Mom left the room with the door slightly opened. I took a deep breath, and it became quiet in the room. I heard nothing from under the bed no more. The End"
The Redundant Crusade,"After what felt exactly like one-thousand-four-hundred-and-eighty-five years, Arthur was finally beginning to suspect he wouldnt be needed any more, and that they could all retire just like his men wanted. But just then, the old stone door covering the cave entrance slid open, and they saw a figure silhouetted by the glory of the daylight.Arthur leapt to his feet at once, his chained mail jingling. Merlin, old chap! Its about bloody time. Then all his knights jumped to their feet too, and everyone drew their swords and cheered, Huzzah!The figure at the mouth of the cave stepped forward, and flipped on a flashlight. When Arthurs eyes adjusted to all the new light, he saw that Merlin didnt look quite the way he remembered.Merlin, old chap! You have turned into a lass! And a comely one at that. The knights all murmured their approval, not having seen a woman in a millennium and a half. Indeed, they hadnt done much of anything in a millennium and a half, other than sitting on their stools in the darkness of the cave, waiting for the day Britain would need them again.Well hey there, fellas, said the woman, with an exaggerated East coast accent. Im Gertie.Gertie? asked Arthur.Thats right. And Im a forest ranger here in the Avalon Wilderness Reserve. And, oh, Im so sorry, but you boys cant be living in this cave. You can camp with a permit though. Oh, and you should know, weve had a few bear sightings nearby.Psst! Lancelot pssted. Arthur, tis not Merlin. tis not Merlin at all!The other knights all concurred with a chorus of Ayes! and By my troths!You are right, I wager, said Arthur. tis no matter. The seal is still broken, and we are called once again to the aid of our beloved Britain.He turned to the ranger. ""Brave Gertie, most breathtaking maiden of the forest paths! Have no fear, for we shall save the day. This, I swear to you, for I am King Arthur Pendragon, son of Uther Pendragon, and these fine warriors are my unparalleled knights!And this cave we shall abandon anon, for weve no more use of it.Thats swell, Gertie said. Thank you, Mr.Pendragon. Oh, theres just one more thing, and Im really sorry to bring it up, but its kind of a biggie.Yes?Well, those things you got, theyre not swords, are they? Theyre not sharpened? You know, you cant just walk around with sharp swords after all.You cant? asked Arthur. He looked at his men, and they were all just as perplexed.Well, surely, Lancelot started, theyre not sharp at all. We dont even have a whet stone down here. The others concurred.And besides, said Gawain, these, er, arent swords at all.They arent? said Gertie.No, no, these are, Gawain continued, then pursed his lips, then finished, knives. Big knives. Decorative cutlery.Oh, thats all swell then, said Gertie.Then its settled! Arthur proclaimed. Let us hie back to Britain, save everyone, and finally drive the Saxons back into the sea!Gertie led King Arthur and his knights out of the cave, but alas, their troubles were only beginning. When she took them to the Newfoundland coast, they promptly started chopping trees down with their decorative cutlery, intending to build a great ship with which to sail back to Britain.Johnson Johnson, Mayor of St.Johns, stopped his pickup at the side of the road and told them, Hey! You cant do that, eh! And then Officers Marney and Klampp arrested Arthur and his knights, and took them to St.Johns.This was just as well, as none of the knights had ever built a ship before, that being more Merlins thing. Arthur found the city overwhelming, with its concrete spires and sorcerous street lights and fire hydrants. When they saw all the horseless metal carriages, presumably propelled by elfish trickery, Galahad fainted. It was all too much, and Arthur used his one phone call to talk to Gertie.They met in the jails cafeteria.Gertie, I need your help, Arthur said. Were in way over our heads here. They want us to pay some kind of fine, only all I have are Roman denarii and they wont accept those, and they say we dont have any ID! How could my identity be in doubt? He unsheathed his sword and raised it high. I wield bloody Excalibur, dont I? How are we ever going to drive the Saxons into the sea now?Oh, Mr.Pendragon, she said, patting his free hand.  dont doubt you, but you boys are in quite the pickle. Look, why dont you sheath that sword for now.Arthur did, looking glum. Things have changed so much, Gertie. I dont recognize Avalon at all anymore.Mm-hmm, Gertie said. Well Avalons just the wilderness reserve. We call this place Newfoundland.Newfoundland?She nodded, then showed him her phone, where they looked at a map of the area. Newfoundland is part of Canada. See? She zoomed out, expanding this strange new world. Which is part of North America. And see, here? The whole globe, in your hand.The worlds a ball? said Arthur, his eyes wide. Blimey. I owe Percival a Coke.I think I can help you guys get out of jail, Gertie said.Arthurs face lit up. Oh, you have my eternal gratitude, fair Gertie! He clasped her hand in his, and she blushed.Gertie was able to negotiate a community service deal for the knights to pay off their fine. This suited them well, for helping communities was their second most important sworn duty, right after driving Saxons back into the sea.They spent a month walking up and down Newfoundlands highways, picking up litter and helping caribou cross the road. Gertie chaperoned and more and more she felt herself drawn to Arthur and his stories. And Arthur had no shortage of questions for her, and was amazed at both her breadth of knowledge and her grace.But when the month was up and their debt was paid, she delivered more bad news.People dont really travel on ships anymore. Thats just for fishing or cargo, she said.But then how shall we ever sail back to Britain? My people need us.Well, most commonly, people nowadays would take an airplane.A An airplane. Its like a bus with wings, and it flies you from one part of the world to another.By my troth! said Percival. You mean to say, tis a dragon!?No, sorry, Gertie said, chuckling. The airlines might have beastly customer service but theyre no dragons. Airplanes are just machines, like cars. But theyre fast! They should get you to London in just over eight hours.Eight  said Arthur, and all his knights buzzed. It took us three bloody  to sail to Avalon. What miraculous sorcery, this! The day is saved! Well show those Saxons what for, yet! Tell me, Gertie, where does one capture such an airplane? And do we need a special saddle?Gertie sighed. She wanted to help Mr.Pendragon, but the prospect of him leaving was getting increasingly hard to bear. Well, you dont need to capture it, she said. But you do need a passport.And so the brave king and his knights hit their next hurdle, for when they went down to the passport office, it turned out that Excalibur still didnt count as a valid ID. Worse, the government had no records of the knights at all  no birth certificates, no drivers licences, no visas, no death certificates  nothing. Not only did they not get passports, they were also ineligible for them.Oh, greatest of woes! said Arthur. Whatever shall we do now?I have an idea, said Gertie. Only, it might take a whileWeve waited this long, Gertie most fair. However you wisely counsel us, so shall we endeavour.You can apply for Canadian citizenship, she said. That way they would  to give you a passport.Then apply we shall!Alas, the application process was a nightmare the likes of which the intrepid heroes had never faced before. They would need addresses, for the mountains of correspondence and paperwork. They would need incomes, to show they werent just a drain on the economy. They would need at least a seventh grade education, and to pass a written test. This new government was labyrinthine and alien, a far cry from the straightforward efficiency of the feudal system they knew and loved.But they grit their teeth and pushed forward. For starters, they decided they would sell jam. They already knew the highways and would set up shop on the shoulders, and of course everybody loved wild jam. Theyd sell by day, and nights they would sit around Gerties large round table, filling in forms according to her guidance, and learning the basics of civics and history.One night, when they had a night off, Gertie asked Arthur if he wanted to see a movie, and so they went to see The Lord of the Rings. Arthur, dearly missing the advice of Merlin, became deeply interested in Gandalf.What a magnificent wizard! he said. I simply must find him! He shall counsel us most wise.Oh, Mr.Pendragon, Gertie lamented. Im so sorry Ive misled you. This story isnt real. Its like a play. Gandalf isnt a real person.Oh, I see, said Arthur, growing quiet. But then he looked up at her with a warm gaze, and he took her hand. No matter. What use are wizards, when I have the privilege of your company?Again, Gertie felt her cheeks run hot, and they spent the rest of the evening grinning at each other over popcorn.Time went on. The jam business brought in a decent penny, but Lancelot saw an opportunity to move faster when he took a job as an assistant manager at a Timmies. Shortly after, Kay and Yvain decided to try their luck on the lobster boats. And so it went, the knights gradually parting ways and following their own paths, until only Arthur and Gertie remained selling jam on the highways.They all still met, every Saturday night around Gerties big round table, going through whatever fresh forms the government required. And they ended each night reaffirming their dream, of driving the Saxons back into the sea. But they saw less and less of each other.Naturally, big events brought them together, like when Kay and Yvain bought their own lobster boat, or when Galahads kid made the Little League team. And of course, when Arthur and Gertie tied the knot. It was a big old party they threw, inviting the whole neighbourhood over.And then, finally, when their forms were all submitted and approved, and their hard work paid off. They became Canadian citizens together. In all, it had taken just over a decade, but the king and his knights were proud, and more to the point, happy the ordeal was behind them.Good show, men, Arthur said. Jolly good show. Weve finally done it. Now all thats left is to get our passports. Then we can finally fly over to Britain, and drive the Saxons back into the sea!As always, Arthur raised Excalibur high into the air, but unlike always, his men werent as enthusiastic this time, instead murmuring half-heartedly. Arthur looked around at his knights, and he saw that they had all come with their new families, their new friends.This week, Gawain had custody of his kids, so the little tykes cheered him on. Caradoc took a break from filming to go through the citizenship ceremony, and he was there with his supermodel girlfriend. Lancelot, now a VP in a major agribusiness conglomerate, had attended with his team of executives. And so it went, each man stamped with the life they had lived.Arthur lowered his blade, and smiled sadly. They had waited one-thousand-four-hundred-and-eighty-five years with him, and then a decade longer. Men, you have served me well. I could not have asked for a better band of brothers in arms. He took a deep breath. I hereby release you from your oaths.The knights nodded solemnly, blinking back tears and smiling. Nothing more was to be said. They bumped chain mailed fists with Arthur, as was knightly tradition since time immemorial, and all went their separate ways, to live their separate lives.And what shall you do, Mr.Pendragon? Gertie asked.I shall continue my quest as ever, my love. I shall return to Britain, and drive the Saxons into the sea.Gertie grinned. I think a vacation sounds lovely.The year it took to get a passport was a pittance compared to the citizenship, and Arthur used that time to get back into shape. Before they knew it, their flight was taking off, and a mere eight hours later they landed at Heathrow Airport in London.It turned out that Britain had changed somewhat in fifteen hundred years. For one, compared to London, St.Johns no longer quite seemed the sprawling metropolis it initially had. Next, it had taken Arthur a good while to get used to cars back in Newfoundland, and now here, it turned out everyone drove on the wrong side of the road. Beyond that though, there was an impossible amount of people.People cheered when they saw him, and they snapped photos and asked for autographs. And then they went on about their day, heading back to the shops, or work, or the next celebrity sighting. And not once, in any time, nor any place, did Arthur see a Saxon.My love, he said, plopping onto a park bench. Has it all been for naught? Did I wait too long? Do people do they truly have no more need of me?Gertie rested her head against his shoulder and interlaced her fingers with his.  people need you, Mr.Pendragon. She beamed at him. I need you.It was enough to raise his spirits and they shared a kiss.Now, weve come all this way, she said. What do you say we just enjoy the rest of our vacation?Id love that!They toured the city of London and saw all the sights to see. Arthur gorged himself on exotic street food, and Gertie snapped photos of everything. When they popped in to a Tesco, they ran into the sitting British Monarch, out doing his groceries, and the two kings spent an afternoon talking shop.Finally, Arthur and Gertie decided to round off their vacation by spending some time in Salcombe, to enjoy the lovely beach weather. Arthur had come to terms with his career being over. As he walked down the pier, holding hands with Gertie and breathing in the fresh salt air, he realized he was fine with it. Perhaps he never got to drive the Saxons to the sea, but, he was fine with it. He was satisfied. No, more than this, he was happy. Britain was free, after all. And now, so was he.They stood at the end of the pier for a good long while, just watching the distant boats and swooping gulls.I love you, he said.I love you, too, she said. Then: Oh, this is funny! I think youll get a kick out of it. I got curious and I did one of those ancestry things, and wouldnt you know it, turns out Im part Saxon.Not missing a beat, Arthur stepped back, placed his hands on her shoulders, and shoved her off the pier.And then he dove in after her, and they shrieked with laughter like rioting children, until the sun set."
"I am Staussey, Dragon","Warning: contains a bit of gore. From the height of my mountain aerie the voices of the men reached my ears from far, below.They sounded angry and full of righteous malicebut it wasnt a sound Id not heard before.As a dragon of the Gemutlich Order, I had been blamed and hunted and followed by these types of voices all my life. I peered out over the edge of the cliff that was my front stoop, not worried that they would see me, for this cavern was higher in the sky than even The Zugspitze, the frosted tip of which I could see 75 miles to the north.I saw the men with my keen dragons eyes, on the mountain pass, as little hairy squat spots crawling like black lice on the pelt of a white dog.They, having been born with mere human eyes, would not be able to see me.Nor was I worried theyd ever reach my cozy nest without wings, it would be impossible. Still, I was curious as to why these angry men would strive so ardently to undertake what would surely be a failed mission.They were on foot, having no doubt left their horses on the lower steppe before the narrow path grows treacherous for heavy hooved feet.I tuned my long ears, sharp as my eyes, towards the ravine and was saddened against my will to detect great sorrow in their voices, in particular, the young man who appeared to be their leader.dragons gone too farslay it once and for alldragon steaks for the entire villageLaughter.  I thought.With an hour until dark, and unable to climb ('further, I watched as the group of nine pitched two tents and assembled a fire. After dark I flew down to the copse of trees twenty feet from the camp.My deep green scales flecked with earthy brown camouflaged me within the evergreens and shadows. I was careful not to reveal any of my belly, for there the wide scales of my armor were of burnished gold and would catch the firelight like a beacon to my whereabouts. I held my breath until the howling wind changed direction, lest the men catch a scent of sulfurous air from my lungs. The leader turned out to be a young man, barely out of his short pants, with long dark hair tied back in a horses tail and the faint shadow of a brand-new beard, most likely his first, on his pale clear skin.The high, widows peaked forehead gave him away, it was the same as his fathersthis was a son of Emperor Wagners.. Next to him was a bearded blond man, also in a fine wool cloak lined with thick winter fox, who had to be his chosen man, a squire that becomes a brother through loyalty. The two scruffy, red-bearded men were at least ten years older and spoke with Irish accents, most likely hired professionals handy with weaponry.The other five were locals from the small village of Bergamont, Id seen them hunting in the woods of the ravine that runs between my mountain and The Zugspitz. The emperors son said, Jan, pass me the map please. My assumption was correct, only the chosen man would be afforded a .His chosen man, Jan, said, Here.Look.This is where we are at. He pointed a finger to the map and tilted it towards the campfire.  One of the red-beards had passed out with a jug in his hands.His brother yanked it out of a greasy grip and said, No ones er climbed farther dan dis.Its too steep.Da face of dis ere mountain, sheer this entire side. He gestured wildly at the slope with his free hand; brandy sploshed out the mouth of the jug. A villager grumbled testily, Eh now Mack, watch that. Jan said, Erik. Even if we find a way up on the other side---One of the locals cut in, thaynt no ways up tother side neither.Been there a plenty collectin rock goose eggs.Jan ignored him and went on, even if we couldthe dragon would pitch us off the mountain top like a child playing Whack the Mouse. I was offended.Gemutlich meant .Perhaps they were confusing me with my nasty tempered cousin, Maud of the Order of The Fleischesser, or .But that would be silly, her scales were black and edged with thorns, we looked nothing alike.She was my closest relative though we rarely spoke.Shed developed a taste for human meat and in doing so, gave our entire species a bad name. A villager with grey hair and very few teeth held his hands out for the jug, Aye.Pass it ere now. Jan took the jug from the red head and offered it to Prince Erik first who shook his head with a frown furrowing his pale brow.But I rescue Fredrika.If I do He trailed off. The villagers looked uneasily at one another.I grabbed another ounce of patience and held my tongue.  They were an annoying species that I kept my distance from. It was a constant battle to keep my decent reputation intact. Four of the villagers got up and staggered to one of the tents.Jan at last broke the awkward silence.Erik. Shes only your -sister.Is the risk worth it?I mean, you live comfortably in the castleAnd so do you, my friend. Thanks to me.I know I knowI wish to be acknowledged by our entire kingdomhell, the world, as Erik.His eyes grew glassy in the firelight, he appeared to be talking to himself.My own castle.My own lands to ruleno longer a bastard.I want  The red head punched his brothers arm hard and roused him sort of awake. He said to the dark-haired young man, Erik, sir, Bergamont is verra appy to have you back in yer home village--- Yes, yes. Good to be back. A fine village it is. He flipped a hand in a whatever gesture that made mockery of his words.He was lying.   I waited for them all to retire then stealthily crept backwards out of the pines.I flew into the inky starless sky.It was overcast, the atmosphere thick with the water-heavy winter air.My powerful wings took me high above the low clouds, where the air was thin, and the stars dazzled my eyes.The frigid air invigorated me as I sailed through heavenly skies to the east. When I sensed Id travelled an hour, I dove back through the cloud cover.Even at this distance above Mauds lair, my sharp nose detected the slobby scents of rotted meat, spoiled cabbage, and the smelly dander left behind from feasting scale mites.Disgusting.I landed at the entrance but did not wish to go inside. Staussey?Eez zat you cousin? The voice of a vixen in heat. Who else would it be? Maud lumbered to the entrance and extended her long neck out.It and her sharply chiseled black head were the only graceful things about her.She licked my nose by way of greeting, an intimate gesture I found repellent.My nose waded through the miasma of stench wafting out behind her bulk; I detected no sweet-smelling young human female. Maud giggled and a faint trail of pale smoke escaped her flared nostrils.Vell, if I didnt kidnap her and you certainly didnt, ve may have a relative lurking about, ney?She had a point.I said, Ive got to go.Ill just make it back by dawn.Youre velcome to stay here. She winked a luminous green eye at me.Thats generous, but no.You mean to help ze humans?I mean to unsully my reputation.   As I flew over my own mountain, I saw by the pink-grey light of dawn that the men had risen early and departed.Their trail was easy to follow and though I preferred venturing out under the cloak of night, I felt compelled to follow.  I rounded a bend and there they were, on horseback, now heading east, not south towards the castle.I ducked behind the lean-to theyd stabled the horses in, it was barely large enough to hide behind, I felt as exposed as an interloper hiding behind curtains with his feet sticking out.I chanced a peek.I ducked back a second later.Erik the Bastard had been looking right at me!   They continued trudging east.I trailed behind them, though letting them get way far ahead, it was easy to follow their hoofprints.After a couple of hours, my nerves had calmed and I crept closer, I desired to hear them and perhaps figure out where they were going.Aware that my footfalls made carumping noises, I walked in the flattened snow of their wake. flew this way this morning Erik.Well get your dragon Jan.Ill slay thee cunt meeself An Irish brother.Ill take your balls Ryan!The dragon is mine Erik.  Erik the Wannabe Prince continued, It was big as a blimey house!And green and gold!Fearsome and breathing fire!His voice grew in volume and clear at this last, for hed turned to face my direction while talking to his men.His voice faded again as he turned and faced away from me.Aye shes aliveheard her screams I was intrigued.   At last, after two more hours, Erik halted the men.There! LookI peeked through a stunted bushy evergreen and saw Erik pointing to a dark shadow in the white face of the foothillsI thought Then I felt sorry for it, even though, apparently it had the same tendencies as Maud as far as humans went. Some of the men were slapping Erik on his back.great job sonweve got it nowI can smell her perfume That was Erik the Bastard himself, which was odd because although I did indeed detect the faint scent of lemons, lavenderand terror, Id never known a human being that was able to from this distance. The men dismounted and ran to the cavern entrance, their swords in hand.As I peeked through the shrubs, I saw five of them still staring into the darkness.After a minute they went in.I followed, just as curious as a cat. As I peeked around the corner, I saw five men and a woman staring back at me. The dark-haired woman was lovely by human standards, about her stepbrothers age, and disheveled and bruised.She had a swatch of cloth, perhaps a mans handkerchief, in her mouth A dragon couldnt tie a gag.Alarm bells shrilled in my head, and I started to back away. There it is! Now!A net dropped over me, with stone weights along its edge, from the curve of rock above the cave. The four men not inside the cave cinched the ropes and I stumbled, my feet flayling in the air. Iron cuffs slapped and bruised my ankles and wrists as I coughed and at last blew a flame hot as hell from my jaws. The ropes burned, reduced to falling cinders like black snow.The men leapt away from the heat.Half the ropes were gone, I raised my neck to burn the rest awayand found Id been chained to the ground, while blind in my panic.They had cinched the chain with a winch, to a metal stake in the ground, immobilizing my head.My left cheek pressed flat against the packed snow.I could not move. When I blew flame, it was ineffectual and merely puddled the ice and snow in a trench before my head. I inhaled icy water through my nostrils.I sputtered and coughed and choked. The excited men leapt around me with swords raised but they did not attack. Erik would have their balls. The Bastard. Erik approached with his sword raised towards my chest.He was preparing to strike between my heartplates and could detect which ones they were by the heavy beating of my heart. He sneered with triumph into the upturned side of my face. Jan had the princess in his arms, she was still gagged, her eyes round and wild.Apparently, hed been in on it. Fredricka was yelling muffled mmmffs into her gag frantically and struggling against her bindings.That she was still bound said it all.It had been a set up all right.I prepared for the blade.I was touched that the Princess was fighting for my life, ineffectually, sure, but she was drawing blood from her bindings, the red dripped from her wrists into the dirty snow. I realized, as she must have, that Erik would not let her live to tell the truth. He would gallantly bring her limp body back as well as the head of the dragon (mine) and become a Prince in his fathers eyes.As we watched, Erik and Jan turned on the five men leftand slaughtered them easily, running them through with their swords, shock and confusion in their glazing over eyes.The princess, weeping, slumped to the ground.  Inside the cave, the Irish brothers were dead.They were like two garishly painted denizens of hell:foaming yellowy curds coated their red beards, their faces purple with black splotches.The poisoned jug lay on its side in the dirt between them. Jan man-handled the princess in front of him, bring her back up on her feet. Erik studied my heartbeat and raised his sword. Suddenly, Jan and Princess Fredricka stumbled forward.Jan went to his knees, dazed.Before he could stand, a blast of flame surrounded his head. He hadnt the time to even scream.His hair sizzled a second then was gone. As his face charred, his eyes burst, then bubbled like porridge in a pot. He flopped forward into the dirt, his head a charred lump with gristley knobs sizzling where his ears had been. Erik stepped towards him.Hed been closer to him than any blood relative; he howled in pain and angerand wonderas Maud lumbered into the now snow-bare, muddy arena. She pounced onto Jans body like a kitten after a yarn ball, then chomped The Bastards head right off. The raised sword arm fell limply to his side, he defiantly stood five full seconds, then his headless body collapsed like the pile of rubbish it was. Maud turned and delicately clipped the princesss binds with her front teeth.Princess Fredricka yanked off the gag and said, he did it!She kicked Eriks cooling body.He took me, the bastard! Then she ran to help Maud release me.She tripped over a dead villager, staggered, but kept her feet. Shed developed some moxy and turned to spit upon the corpse. Then she found the keys to the shackles in Jans waistcoat and unchained me.  Maud had snapped the neck chain with her powerful claws.When I stood, she licked my nose. I looked her in the eyes. . She winked at me then turned to devour the Wannabe Prince. I found her alluring. The snapping of the bones was a pleasant melody, oddly romantic. Princess Fredrickas adrenaline was wearing off, she realized she was turning blue.She stripped Jans fine fur-lined cloak off him and wrapped it around herself.It would also serve as evidence to the wild tale she was about to relate to her father.  I persuaded her to climb my back. She hugged my neck and though I still found humans repugnant and annoying, I was happy to restore my good name and see her home safely"
"March, Before Dawn","I returned home like a fox running to earth, retreating to a place of unexpected safety. It was before dawn and the sky was turning blue at its seams. I took a breath of the night air; it was cool and clean and made me feel intensely awake. When had I last been here, six months or more, last Christmas, before?I could feel the debris of the city sloughing off me, streaming from my pores to be neutralised by the salt air.The hospital stink losing its grip and seeping away in the pre-dawn light. The door of the house was unlocked, which wasnt unusual. I made my way upstairs and laid my bag carefully on the bed. I had brought only one small suitcase, neatly packed and I found the orderliness of it gave me an immense sense of satisfaction. First I took a shower and then I put the suit I had been wearing into the washing machine, I hesitated and then threw in the carefully folded contents of my suitcase as well, you couldnt be too careful. This left me with a towel, so enfolded I sat and watched as the clothes rolled round in the drum. The washing machine whirred and hummed, what a wonderful thing it was, I watched it sleepy and hypnotised. My phone flashed blue, but I let it go to voicemail, too late. It rang again and I switched it off. The next morning was sunny, I awoke too early because the curtains in the guest room were thin and let in all the light, which was brilliant and very yellow. I scrunched up my eyes against it but it fought its way through. The house was quiet. No one home. I went back down to the kitchen, one unwashed mug by the sink. Had that been there last night? I didnt know. There wasnt a car in the driveway, just my blue ford parked up along the verge. Gone to work then. The blue sky stretched invitingly out over the houses and down towards the sea, not quite in sight but close by. A walk then, over the downs and along the shore. The town was curiously quiet, too early for tourists, but not many dog walkers, anglers, retirees and other hangabouters. When I reached the seafront the tide was far out leaving a long clear stretch of damp sand, reaching passed the arms of the cliffs. I walked along the beach a long way, enjoying the feeling of expanse, the sea stretching out infinite beside me, the widening kind of blue you long to run towards.I felt a pang of loneliness, to be here alone, where we had so often been together. It was then I realised I had left my phone behind, but never mind - probably not much signal out here anyway. It wasnt late when I returned, and everything seemed the same. I checked the cupboards and the fridge, enough food, no milk. And wine? David would surely like to come home to a light supper? A contribution to the household? A pleasant surprise? Had he noticed I was here last night? Unlikely, but he must have seen the car this morning? Seen divined and ignored? I made my short list and walked over to the supermarket, busy after the isolation of the morning. Some people wore masks which made them look angry or started, mine kept riding further and further up my face, inching up my nose and onto my eyes. Next time David could do the shopping. It was 7 before I began to wonder where David was, not usually a late worker. Where could he have gone? Was he perhaps avoiding me? I dug out my phone and switched it back on, many missed calls, nothing from David. It took me a long time to pick out a text, the essence of which was, I am here, where are you? At 8 I washed the cup that was still sitting on the counter from this morning. Then I called David, it rang for a long time and my heart skittered, no answer. I tried again half an hour later and left a message on his voicemail, please call me. I wondered if I should call, Anna, Dad? But it wouldn't go through. I tried David one more time.I tried to wonder what David had been doing, did he have a new girlfriend? Was he away on some inexplicable work trip? I couldnt remember what he had said when we had last spoken, when had it been? Two weeks or more ago. He had rang two days ago but I hadnt answered. Was this silence some kind of petty revenge? I went outside and checked what I already knew. His car was gone. Returning upstairs, I knocked tentatively on his bedroom door. David I called David are you in there? I slid the door open, half expecting to see him there, lying on his bed, absorbed in some game. Empty of course, bed unmade, which meant nothing David wasnt one for careful bed making. Was anything missing? His laptop? I couldnt see that, clothes? Well some were here - hard to tell. Phone charger, present and correct. Then he hadnt meant to be gone long? Would, perhaps, be back soon? I stared anxiously around the room, willing the objects to transform themselves into the clues that would let me know my brothers whereabouts. I picked at dinner and called David again, no response. Calling the police felt like an overreaction, didnt you have to wait some period of time anyway? 48 hours? Was David missing? Or was he simply not here, had he sensed my presence and decided to go elsewhere? Were they all so angry with me? I drank the two glasses of wine I had poured which made my head feel heavy, the lack of sleep was catching up with me. Rest, and then in the morning, David.I awoke suddenly, as if startled by a loud noise. A slamming door? A car? David? I sat up slowly trying to arrange my ideas, I must go find David. So I must get out of bed, had he slammed the door? I stumbled thick headed down the stairs. Everything looked the same, outside, I could hear a car somewhere on the estate. Was that David? Had he come back late last night? I searched the kitchen for some trace of his presence, two dirty plates, two empty wine glasses, I must have eaten Davids food as well. Or he had eaten it. I stood staring at the dishes as if they were some simple sum I couldnt make add up.I had been here, last night and I had eaten, which plate? One? Both? How could I ever know if David was missing when my own memory seemed motheaten through, badly patched and re-pieced together. What was the time? Almost 9 oclock now. Surely David would be back tonight, and if not I would call someone the police maybe. Anna, I should call Anna and hear the news. I went for another, longer walk to distract myself, it was colder but still sunny. Gulls wheeled over my head crying to each other, the surf was rougher and my clothes were covered in a fine mist of spray. I wanted to pause to hide inside this moment and emerge only when all was resolved. To appear again at the denouement, or after. The threads of my story seemed hopelessly lost, the future a frightening blank.I was late returning home, I wanted to give David every chance to come back. I almost burst into tears when I rounded the corner and saw the still empty driveway. Not back. Not returned. I searched every room of the house, in case he should have returned on foot and chosen to hide behind the ironing board. I picked up my phone and called David. It didnt even ring this time, cutting straight to voicemail. Was David lying in a ditch somewhere, his phone now dead and silent beside him?I shut my eyes tightly and then opened them a little to call Anna. She picked up on the first ring. Have you seen David? I said quickly while she was still drawing in breath Why? I was trying to get in touch with him He said youre not taking his calls. Look, are you coming back? If you see him tell him to call me again, Im not ignoring him. I want to see him. Ok? I hung up the phone quickly. Trying to call me? I checked my phone again, just the one call from David 3 days ago now. I paced the room, should I call Anna again? No, I had given her the message. She would surely pass it on if she heard anything. Ought I to have told her David wasnt here? Surely no need to worry her further. I spent the evening on Facebook, I contacted all of Davids friends. No one who had seen or spoken to him in the last two days, they all passed on their condolences.I paced the room again. One more day? Should I call the police now? I looked at my phone again, messages from Anna, messages from an unknown number. Who was that? Should I call them back? Might it be about David? Was it the hospital trying to get in touch with me? Many texts that I couldn't bear to read. Was it over yet?In the morning. One more night. I woke again in the blue light before dawn. A dark figure loomed over my bed, a scream caught in my throat. Then streetlight through the window caught the nose, the chin. David. Youre here, where have you been? Where have I been? What do you mean? Where do you think I was?' Youre not missing I said to David, stupid and accusing. 'No, I'm not, you're the one who disappeared.' Why wouldnt you answer my calls? He gazed at me in stupefaction Mike I lost my phone he explained gently I got a new one, which you would know if you ever answered  phone. Or read any of your messages. Why didnt Anna tell me? She tried to but you hung up on her. She guessed you were here, so she sent me to bring you back. She's furious with you for taking off in the middle of the night like that.' 'I knew she would be.' 'Why did you do it?' 'I just had to get away. I couldn't bear it anymore. You think you're the only one this is hard for? Youre such a child sometimes. Look' he paced the short length of the room 'I don't want to fight but you have to come back now. It's almost over, you need to say goodbye.' 'I can't David' my breath choked in my throat, tears pricking at my eyes 'I can't do it. He looks so blank it's like he's not there.' 'Dad loves you, how can you leave him now?' I sat helpless on the bed, the sun I knew, was once more creeping up over the horizon."
Pigs Fly before humans,"Where I come from, pigs could fly before humans 	Those tiny bundles of joy, my dearest grandchildren stopped crying immediately. At ages 7 and 6, it is expected that they have little quarrels. Ones that always end in tears and snot and broken toys. But every time I say that sentence, they stop crying. 	After blinking out some tears and rubbing some snot on his sleeve, my older one said, Daddad, daddad, tell me the story? 	The story, ahh. I start with that sentence, but every time I tell them a made-up story to teach them a lesson. But sibling love is too important for a fairy tale. 	If I tell you my story, will you stop crying and say sorry to your sister?	All I got was a head bob, but that was enough for me. I turned to my younger grandchild. Are you going to say sorry to your brother? She quickly turned around and walked briskly for her room, sounding a pitter-patter of little footsteps. She jumped for the doorknob and brought it down a little loudly. After rummaging through what I was sure of to be toys and other knickknacks lying on the floor, she came back carrying something behind her back. She faced her brother and presented a small teddy bear apple. Or is it called a Teddy Apple? It is a cotton stuffed green apple. 	I sorry big bwother. take this? 	She nudged the apple against his chest and smiled a would-be toothy grin. Would be because two teeth had fallen out. 	The elder brother looked away from her and put his hands inside his pants. I always tried to stop that habit of his. I assumed he got it from watching the older kids play around the neighborhood. Those punks always strut about with their hands in their pockets. Hands are supposed to be used, not put away. I always think of people who dont have hands when I see people like that. Now the littlest punk in the world wants to be cool as they call it these days. But he doesnt have pockets. So his  solution was to put those grubby hands directly in his pants. 	Eddie, Eddie, take those hands out of your pants you little rascal, I said with just a bit of sternness in my voice. And what do you say to your sister? 	Eddie reluctantly pulled his hands out and made sure to pout heavily when he accepted her apology present. Although his frown disappeared when he hugged it. 	Im sorry too, Merry. Thank you for this apple, I will tra- tre- trezure it, he said as he pretended to eat it. 	Silly Eddie, Merry giggled, that's a toy. And its a FRUITFruit! Eww, he replied as they both laughed.I let out a sigh. Crisis averted. 	What do you want to do for dinner? Your mom is gonna come soon, so we better make something before she brings out the day before yesterdays leftover. 	The kids were looking at each other puzzled as I was laughing at my joke. 	Daddad, they said in almost perfect unison. 	Yes, little ones? 	Story time, you promised, Eddie said. 	Oh, you still remember what I said? I was hoping I could go to bed. 	No, no. no, tell us your story!, they said as they banged their chubby fists against my legs. 	Fine, fine. Alright? Now gather around on the floor. 	They let out joyous shouts of yays and wahoo's while I waited for them to quiet down. 	Long, long, time ago, when this old man wasnt old, nor a man, I lived on a large island 	I looked down to see if they were paying attention. Their eyes were wide open with anticipation. My old heart was warmed when I saw that. Not many times do younger people care to hear stories of the old times. There was a rigid class system. Made it hard to live there. Think of it hard to get rich if your poor, I clarified as I saw their looks of confusion. 	The island was a tributary to a large nation. That means we have to send gifts to powerful people every year to make them happy. 	Like the apple? Merry asked innocently. 	I wish it was like the apple, but it's not. It was people. People were sent as slaves to the nation. It was horrible for our people. 	What is a slave?  	Eddie, imagine this. I ask you to clean your room, and you HAVE to do it. And in the end, you get no candy. But if I ask Merry to clean her room, she doesnt have to do it. But if she does, she gets candy. Doesnt seem fair does it? 	He nodded furiously. 	There is much more horrible stuff, but you are kids, let's not get into that. 	After ignoring complaints and claims such as I can take it, I am a big boy/girl, I continued. 	The way it worked was like this. The firstborn child gets to live on the island. The second-born child is sent to the big nation as a warrior, and the third and after child are sent as a slave. You might wonder why not the parents do not ask the crow for the third child, but they do it because they get food in exchange for their children. So poor parents that wanted grain and milk, even if it meant their kids would suffer, asked the crow for children. And the crow gave them. My parents like that. I hated them for it. 	I paused for dramatic effect and to make sure the kids were keeping up. I wouldnt want my audience falling asleep like that. 	The first child the crow gave was my older brother. Like Eddie is to you Merry. His name was Inruk. The crows second gift was me, Daddad. And the third one was my little sister, Shamala. She was like what Merry is to you, Eddie. I loved both of them. But when I turned 12, I was sent to be a warrior. 	Wow, you were so cool! they squealed, did you defeat your enemies and rescue the princess? 	I wish, I replied solemnly. I tried to be cheerful, but remembering that was saddening. 	I didnt want to be a warrior. But I was forced. In that place, I couldnt make my dream come true. I always wanted to be a farmer, but I couldnt. And my sister had it worse. She became a slave as soon as she turned 10. The owner would have beaten, starved, dehumanized her. 	I looked down and saw their puzzled faces. I gently blinked some of my tears and continued. 	But one day I got a letter. It said my brother died. 	Both kids gasped and screamed. They started crying and hugged each other. I silently was relieved when I saw their grief. No one, except me, would mourn Inruk. But even though he died over 60 years ago, and they never got to know him, they still shed tears. I cried with them, and in between sobs, I went on. 	The tribute system , I sniffed, worked oddly. When a firstborn son dies before age 19, it is as if they never existed. It was believed they were never supposed to be born. Merry, it's like if Eddie disappeared and you were never allowed to think about him. 	She teared up even more, while Eddie was agape in horror.Were you sad Daddad? You werent allowed to think of Bigger Daddad? asked a hesitant Eddie. 	I was very sad Eddie, but as I told you, it was as if he never lived. When there is no first child, the children coming after go up in rank. I became firstborn, while my sister became secondborn. I am ashamed, but a part of me was glad I could rescue my sister from slavery. I thought that even being a part of the military was better than being a slave. So I tried to search for her. I copied the letter and sent it everywhere in the district. Most of the slaves went to the city where I was stationed because it had a lot of farms. Slaves worked there from morning to evening. I went from one plantation to another, trying to free her. When that didn't work, I searched in different districts. After that, I searched in different states. But even after all of that, I never found her. She must have died never knowing the fate of my brother, died being a slave. I was never there for her 	I burst into tears and hid my face in my hands. I always wondered if she blamed us me and Inruk for making her a slave. What if she cursed us on the day she died. Even though I would understand if she hated us, I wanted to know. To know if she loved the brothers that forced her into slavery. But now, that will never happen.  	My grandchildren saw my breakdown. But they didn't say a word. They just walked up to make and embraced me.   	I was in sorrow for the death of my siblings, and how I never got to experience their love. I don't ever want them to go through what I did.  	I slowly returned the embrace and said, promise me, Eddie, Merry, you will always be there for each other? I almost begged. 	They slowly nodded. We slowly drifted to sleep, with them on my lap. I never finished my story, but I still hope its lesson will live with them. Just like it did with me."
The Path of Blame,"Frankie looked her dog in the eyes, eyes the same deep sienna brown as her own, and said, Okay Audrey, today we will find complete happiness in the solitude of nature. She tied back her long sandy blond hair.Audrey whined and stood up as her harness was fastened under her belly, the tail that curled over her back wagged like mad, wiggling her butt along with it.For a moment she forgot her manners and leapt straight up on legs like springs- like Tigger- until her eyes were level with Frankies.The dog said, Okay, okaylets go.Audrey was the size of a golden retriever, but with glossy black fur with white patches on her nose, chest, and all four paws.She had large, pointed ears like a deer, and it seemed she had too many teeth, an upper canine and a lower one never quite fit inside her mouth.She was an odd-looking dog; in the shelter it had been love at first sight.Frankies thighs burned as she followed Audrey up a very steep dirt path.She looked up, breathing heavily, to gauge how much farther it was to the fallen stump at the top.Audrey bounded back to her, stopping to acknowledge a chittering squirrel six feet over them in a pine tree. As she neared the tree, the squirrel said, ! It scampered higher into the green boughs.Then a jay screeched to get her attention, it said, Both dog and woman stepped left into the ferns just in time!From over the fallen log at the top of the hill, came a kid on a BMX bike.He caught air, his long blond hair flagging wildly behind from under a turned around ball cap, a maniacal grin on his face.He thumped down to the path three feet from Frankies feet. He had some sort of GoPro on his head though he wore no helmet.Frankie said, Hey!Hey, you nearly hit us!The wild boy didnt stop, he was soon out of sight.It had been increasingly difficult to find good trails.Closer to the city, there were too many people, many of whom were uptight about off-leash dogs, and most paths were kid and even stroller friendly. Ugh. Some of the most challenging didnt even allow dogs, but instead catered to the mountain bike crowd.Theyd hiked the day before, through an immense nature reserve with miles of decent trails and challenging climbs, only to come upon a city of homeless people in dirty tents and tarps and mountains of trash.When she came across grungy hypodermic needles and human waste in the center of the path, shed vowed angrily not to return. The display of selfish entitlement these crazy, drug-addled people displayed depressed her.They had turned something beautiful into a cesspool.She wept all the way home.A week ago, theyd thought theyd found a secluded forest with grown-over forgotten trails miles into a redwood forest housing the tallest trees theyd ever seen.Then theyd smelled smoke.Frankie had been alarmed at first, fearing the worst, until she came upon a large man, hairy as Sasquatch, with crazy oozing out his pores.Hed been living in a hut made of pallets and branches. Hed come towards her drooling and making strange mmm-ing noises until Audrey scared him away.Whether real or imagined, the smell of his cook-fire smoke brought back flashes of long ago when shed been just five:Shed thought shed been a happy child. Shed loved her parents though she couldnt recall their faces, and an older brother who she had adored because even though hed been ten years older, hed played with her and taken her to the park and on long hikes through the woods by their home.He said he could talk to the animals and birds, and she had laughed.She had no memories of her parents taking her anywhere fun, she supposed she blocked them out for being too painful.She remembered a church, a big gothic thing, terrifying and fun.One day, deep in the woods, her and Brian had come across an injured squirrel.Shed watched in fascination as her brother picked it up gently and talked to it soothingly and  to it.In her head, she had thought she heard a high-pitched whisper, After Brian had placed the squirrel in his backpack and told Frankie they had to hurry back now, shed timidly said, B-Brian. I heard it too.Brian hugged her and said, The desperate have a louder voice.I knew youd be able to hear them tooSo, you believe me?Ive been waiting for this.Now  do not tell anyone.Okay?Why not?They will punish you.Brian had been blamed for the fire.Who else could it have been?Hed been fifteen, and you know how disobedient and conniving teenagers are.Probably been smoking cigarettes out his window, flicking the embers into the dry grass.Both her parents had perished, and it was assumed Brian was dead too, though his body was never recovered.Half the house had slid into the river when the retaining wall gave way, his bedroom had been in the basement, his body most likely swept away by the eddying waters.Frankie had nightmares to this day, of leaping from the attic window, smoke billowing hot against her back, into the net of the firefighters.Frankie and Audrey stood at the top of the hill and admired the green panoramic scene.The sky above was still overcast, just the way she liked it.It was four oclock. She was disturbed by BMX Kid.His behavior was unnervingly reckless, but even more so, she was again dismayed to have discovered yet another awesome hiking path only to find inconsiderate humans used it too.She sighed unhappily.She rubbed Audreys silky soft head.Oh Audrey, ever the optimist.Frankie looked down as a leafy branch quivered over a patch of orange fur.They made their way down the hill, the fox peeked its pretty, pointy-nosed face out from the dense shrub and said,  It slunk out of sight like molten lava.What? What other one?Audrey said,  She looked as if shed bitten into a lemon.Frankie laughed.Then heard a branch snapclose behind them.Audreys fur was tufted along her hackles, her ears pointed forward, and a low growl purred from her throat like a Harleys motor idling.The shrubs along the left of the path, twenty feet ahead, shivered.A tubby little creature popped out, rolled to a stop, and sprung to its feet.At first, Frankie thought it was a tubby racoon, grey furred and barrel-shaped.Then she thought it was a small fat child wrapped in a fur coat.Dont know.The thing had the face of a child, with a mop of shoulder length hair the same shade as its coat.Its ears were pink like its face, but longer, elfin-like.From the bottom of its tubby body were two skinny legs with five-toed black feet.It carried a spear, its wickedly pointy head glinted silver, reflecting the overcast sky.It also wore the same sort of GoPro BMX Kid had been wearing. It was a curved silver rectangle on a pole that appeared to be embedded in the things head; it rotated slowly left to right, left to right.Frankie thought of the satellite dish her neighbors had had on their roof, she had been jealous that they had television.The thing thumped the dirt with the butt of its spear and shrieked like a banshee.SCREEEE! Every hair on Frankies body stood up, much like Audreys.Hey now, Cutie, well just be goingCmon Aud, lets go back.Audrey placed herself in front of Frankie, growl still idling.Frankie started backing away.SCRRREEEEEEEEE! Thud! It jumped high into the air!It landed behind Frankie and smiled, revealing a too-wide mouth full of pointy little teeth.Frankie ran.Come on!Audrey held her ground a few seconds longer, giving Frankie time to get away, then she ran too.Raccoon Boy did not follow.The rutted path they followed narrowed, Frankie stumbled twice, Audrey stopped every fifty feet or so to look behind them. She said, As a gloomy twilight approached, they stopped in a small clearing and looked behind them. A branch snapped in the growing gloom in the woods, shadows melded together.As they watched, a tall, thin, dark figure emerged from between two trees. It had four long thin legs, each ending in a point like a spiders delicate foot, and a humanoid body, stretched.Its head was triangular, with large round eyes, it looked like a praying mantis but had two thin long arms ending in human hands.The satellite thingy on its head glinted in the ink-blue atmosphere, as it rotated left to right.They leapt through a dense hedge of hemlock and came upon a cabin in a clearing hidden there.It looked deserted.Audrey?This cant possibly be its home.A snap.A rustle.Audrey tried the door.Unlocked.They dove inside, saw that there were three locks and a thick metal bar that fit into brackets across it.They looked out the window by the door.Mantis Man sat across the clearing with both sets of legs crossed.Its enormous dark eyes blinked at them.Frankie said, Look.Its BMX Kid.He was sitting to the left, across the clearing, his bike on its side next to him.Audrey said, . The things coat gleamed silver in the black night, it was a three-foot pom- pom with a head.Frankie tried the light switches by the door.Amazingly, they worked.Though the inside lighting was soft as candlelight, she switched it off.She left the porchlight on, to light up the clearing.Mantis Man turned out to be green. They sat by the window all night.As she stared, she tried to communicate with the creatures.She didnt understand why Mantis and Raccoon did not answer her enquiries.All of natures fabulous minds were eager to communicate with her.She even tried BMX Kid though she was loathe to do so, human minds often left her sickened, shed turned off that ability in herself long ago, like flicking a toggle switchBut even from him, nothing. Just a cold as outer space.At last, dawn came with the flourish she loved.It meant hike time, nature time.Peace and quiet and communion with the forest dwellers.This morning, however, only brought more terror.The three were out there, watching.Raccoon Boy grinned his toothy grin.BMX Kid gave her the Hawaiian hang loose hand sign.A squirrel hopped onto the flowerbox on the windowsill, between the bright red geraniums blooming there, inches from Frankies face on the inside.Frankie screamed.I knowsorry.The squirrel tapped on the window and pointed at the inside latch.Window, got it. She hesitated.Oh, fuck it. She unlatched the window lock and lifted the pane four inches.The wee squirrel ducked inside.Frankie slammed the window down, wincing. The three sentinels sat placidly watching.She said, Whats going on?You know this place?The squirrel said, Dog and woman sighed with relief.Like all woodland creatures, squirrels never lied.(Though Raccoons tended to exaggerate, and foxes tended to be sneaky.)The squirrel said, . She raced across the cabin to the kitchen nook.Frankie had little time to look around, but what she saw she liked.The cabin was clean and furnished with hand-crafted rustic furniture.A small tv sat on a low bookshelf filled with old classics.They followed the squirrel.The kitchen was an immaculate 1950s reproduction in red and white, with modern amenities fitting in.The squirrel led them through a pantry door, they followed.At the far end, was a solid wooden wall.At the bottom was a small strip of wood that stuck out a half an inch.The squirrel pointed to it, excitedly hopping up and down. Frankie bent and pushed against it.The floor of the pantry started sinking.Frankie was about to panic but saw the squirrel was smiling and clapping her hands with joy.As the pantry went down half a story, the squirrel climbed swiftly out the opening and said, Frankie realized with amusement that faint music was being piped in through invisible speakers.It was her favorite band, one her brother used to listen to: Pink Floyd, the song was Shine on You Crazy Diamond. I feel like Alice in Wonderland.Audrey saidHa ha.She jumped as the elevator stopped.The wall slid open.They stepped into a hallway lined with caramel-colored tiles softly lit by brass wall sconces.The wall at the other end slid open as she approached it.Frankie gaped in wonder, jaw hanging open like a funhouse clown's, as she took in the immense space.It was the most beautiful library ever.Three of the twenty-foot walls were lined with shelves of books, a wheeled ladder reached the top.There was a propane fireplace with fake logs, a vast mahogany coffee table with carved cats feet legs, a settee, and three deep armchairs upholstered in deep-jewel-colored hues.Six end tables shaped like bears held tiffany lamps. The rugs were thick red wool.As she walked past the bookshelves, she noticed that all the countless figurines on the shelves and tables were robots or monsters of some kind.Some she recognized from tv shows and moviesGodzilla, R2-D2, Wolverine, the Iron Giant, the AlienMantis Man- the sentinel outside.The third wall where the fireplace sat, also housed a door.It opened and a man in a white lab coat walked in.He was tall, with a high forehead, his long, tied-back hair the same dirty blond as hers though his was greying at the temples.He had leather gloves on his long-fingered hands. He removed his reading glasses and blinked at her with eyes the same dark shade as hers, then he smiled and said, Franchetta, hello, and welcome.She backed away, her mouth snapped shut like a trap.Audrey whined.Dont be afraid.Im Brian Brian.Frankies veins filled with ice-water, her legs turned to oatmeal, she caught the edge of the coffee table before she hit the ground and plopped onto a cushy ottoman. No.The fire. Audrey hopped up next to her.Brian went to a bar tucked in the corner opposite the fireplace and poured them each four fingers of an amber elixir.He came towards her, and she shied away, eyes round as ping pong balls.He halted a second, then sat opposite her, pushing the crystal glass on a coaster towards her.Remy Martin.He sipped his and put it down.You killed them.An accident, but Her hands shook in her lap.It was not Iuhdo you still go by Frankie?She nodded.Audrey said, !Brian laughed then said to the dog, More like Mad Scientist.Frankie said, It really is you. She swallowed half the cognac.You dont remember our parents at all do you?I was happy?No.Neither of us was happy.Mother found out about us.You kept your promise, but Father caught you talking to that deer that used to come around.Bella.Yes.Mother blamed our Father, said his seed was cursed, that we were Satans spawnThat awful black churchShe dragged us there.That dark priest was as insane as she was.He told her the only way to save our souls was with fire.Frankie gasped.I tried to save you. He removed his gloves, his hands were made of metal.I saw you jump. When the house collapsed, I was thrown into the river, unconscious.I woke entangled in a fall of branches, a beavers dam, far from home. The beaver showed me where humans lived, and I was taken in at a hospital. Then sent to a specialist in prosthetics. It was there I studied with a wonderfully brilliant doctor, a scientist. You would have loved him, he taught me much and helped build this place He pulled out a smart phone and tapped it a few seconds.Texting?Ha! Not quite The elevator door opened, and the three sentinels came in.Audrey yipped.As one, they raised a hand and waved hello.Mantis Man said, Gru-gruuuu wimi-siaaaahhh.Brian said, He says hes sorry he scared youand welcome.Im working on fixing his voice, his names Maury by the wayThese creatures, the sentinelsyou made them. Thats why I couldnt talk with them, they arent alive.Raccoon Boy said, SCRA! Ganorf!Brian said, Spooky! Be real. To his sister he said, hes in denial. Im fixing his voice as well.Audrey said, Brian said, smart pupyes, Sameel found you for me and grew increasingly concerned for Frankie.So, I built the cabin for youand my sister.Audrey said to FrankieThe goofy dog leapt up and down, tail and butt waggingFrankie went to her brother and hugged him. Thank you. Youve saved my life."
My Hamster Massacred My Family,"Hey kid, no one blames you for this butchery, you know that dont you? The police lady speaking to Sam chews gum at a nervous rate of repetitions, picking dirt from under her painted fingernails as she does so; anything to avoid eye contact. She is as round as a beach ball, so round the top button of her khaki pants is unfastened. Her red hair is short, like the Marine sergeants Sam idolizes in war movies he and his dad stream. Marine sergeants, however, dont wear pink lipstick. She smells too, but not like the girls Sam knows, which is just his mom and older sister Charlotte. This woman smells like his gym class, of sweat and aerosol deodorant. Yep, Sam decides, staring down at his blood-soaked t-shirt; the police lady smells like a teenage boy. Only worse because most teenage boys Sam knows dont chain-smoke menthol cigarettes, the ones that come 40 to a pack. The police officer smells nothing like his mom, who leaves the house each morning to sell houses smelling sweet, like roses and summer.	. Sam reminds himself. His mom  smell of roses. She is in the past tense now.	He reads her name tag, Officer Waters, and sees crumbs of cinnamon sugar hanging off untrimmed whiskers that protrude horizontally from her chin, or should that be chins? Sam is only 14, and doesnt know too much, but he knows enough to know something is up with Officer Waters. He takes a moment to study her from the top step of the front porch stairs where he has planted himself  the night is cool and he needs the fresh air, away from the rusty stench of fresh blood. Crazy. Here she is, standing in the middle of a bloodbath, four bodies ferociously massacred and she looks pleased with herself. Sam is no stranger to this look; hes seen it a dozen times. Its the look Charlotte has every time her phone goes Bing! with another dumbass text message from that dumbass jock boyfriend of hers, Gunner. (Is that really a name, Sam wondered out loud when he first had to shake the dipshits hand.) Every time Sam sees Gunner, and his goon squad of blonde-haired jocks, he just wants to puke. Though now his sister is upstairs, laying in a pool of her own gore, her throat torn to shreds and her blood-stained cheerleader body stiffening with rigour mortis, Sam guesses he wont be seeing too much of Gunner anymore. Well, at least one good thing came out of tonights massacre.	This is all my fault.	Who cares, thinks Officer Sally. Truth-be-told, Sally cant believe her good fortune. . She feels so lucky she struggles to hide her glee. She never had a good poker face, but if there is one time to master one, its tonight. She looks down at the monstrous brat she is ordered to watch and sees big fat wads of $100 bills. She takes a moment to consider him.Hes so scrawny she could bench press him, and that sickly-sweet face framed by a well-barbered crop of brown hair, matted in parts by clots of drying blood, is pot marked with pimples. A part of Sally just wants to get her chipped nails and squeeze the puss out of them. Worst of all, he reeks of privilege. Stinks of it. Like privilege is dog shit, and he stood in it. She only needs to look down at his Airforce Ones - who buys a 14-year-old the latest Nikes? - to know this kid doesnt want for anything. But what really gets her goat is his teeth. Sally sees a perfect set of fangs every time the little monster smiles. If her mom wasnt such a deadbeat, marrying jerks and spending the few dimes she earned working the cash register at Walmart (and padded out with welfare checks and food stamps) on cigarettes and bottles of Yellow Tail Sauvignon Blanc from Australia, then maybe she too would have a set of nice teeth.	Sally is a betting girl and would wager a sawbuck that some kid knocks those pearly whites right out his smirking grin the first night he beds down in juvenile detention for slaughtering his family. She has not seen the carnage herself, but she hears the officers investigating the blood bath upstairs puking into brown paper bags Detective Johnson has handed out. ""It's sickening up there, boys, more like a human abattoir than someone's home."" Not being one of the boys, Johnson told Sally to wait downstairs and look after the kid. She was pissed until she had her come to Jesus moment.	It is dark, past 8 pm. Sam is hungry. He hasn't eaten since breakfast though he dares not ask for food. When your family lay viciously butchered upstairs, their innards used to re-decorate the bedrooms like the killer took cues from an episode of Good Bones, the television decorating show, being hungry is the last thing you should be. Sam watches enough television cop shows to know the drill, but everything happening right now is so surreal, so not of this world, he feels he stepped into an episode of Stranger Things.	The front yard of Sam's house is a rodeo of cops, ambulance officers, onlookers, and, of course, television news crews. He's watched the shenanigans for the past ten minutes since he was ushered downstairs and into the waiting arms of that human beachball. First, there was one news crew from the local station, then one more, then another two, and now there must be 10, including Fox and CNN. It reminds him of pigeons in the park. Start feeding one, and before you know it, there is a flock in a feeding frenzy before your eyes. Sam hears a noise and cranes his head left. Mr Simpson's torso is lying in an open body bag that a man with a ponytail, wearing a jacket that reads CORONER, is about to zipper close. Mr Simpson is - was - a nosy neighbour, always causing grief for Sam's mom, popping over at inappropriate times of the day, an empty sugar bowl in one hand as he rattled the front door with the other. ""Mrs Baker, it's Mr Simpson. Are you home?""Sam smiles, remembering his mom, rolling her eyes and making an imaginary gun with her thumb and forefinger, holding her hand up towards the front door and pulling the imaginary trigger, mouthing the word ""kapow"".	Two police officers with flashlights now search the trimmed hedge that separates the two properties - his and theirs - for Mr Simpson's head. It is missing. Sam wonders if Roger - that's the name of his hamster - ate it or tossed it aside. Roger eats grains and pieces of lettuce, so Sam can't imagine he would have an appetite for a head. Then again, who thought Roger could do this?	Officer Waters takes a handkerchief from her pants pocket, spits into the top corner and brings it to Sam's face to sponge off the blood. She knows she shouldn't - it might be evidence, but she needs this kid to trust her and fast. ""There, there,"" she says, feigning empathy. ""What a night you've had."" Sam does not know this, but Officer Waters earlier had taken her iPhone and turned on the recording app, placing the phone in her top pocket.	Sally Waters has always wanted to be rich. Rich like those women on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Atlanta, even those Jersey bitches. Nothing she did, however, landed a dime in her pocket. Her lotto tickets each week lost; the girls she dated, the ones she met on Tinder and down at the saloon bar on a Saturday night - if she wasn't hauling her fat arse doing overtime - were as broke as she was. Weekly trips to the casino left her with a hangover and an empty purse.	Then, not too long ago, she and some other cops were slurping coffee and scoffing doughnuts over at Dunkin Donuts on 54 and 3 when one of the cops, she thinks his name was Barry, told a yarn about a cop he knew who got a six-figure payment from one of those tacky tabloid magazines you wade through whilst waiting in line at Walmart, selling them photos of a crime scene he had attended. Sally's ears pricked up. ""How much?""	Barry spoke chewing a mouthful of Strawberry Frosted. One hundred thousand smackeroos.	And now here she is, Sally Waters, sitting next to a snotty-nosed privileged kid who is the main suspect of what will be known as the Sycamore Street Slayings, the most brutal murders anyone in these parts can remember. ""Inhuman,"" one news reporter will describe them; another will use words like ruthless, savage, cruel and merciless. All she must do is coax out his ridiculous story, dash upstairs, take a couple of snapshots and before she knows it, she too will have teeth as perfect as his. Maybe take herself to Cancun for a vacation. Or put a deposit down on one of those condos they are building downtown that look over the river, where the railyard was, and Wholefoods now is. She could afford to join a gym, lose a few pounds, shop somewhere nice and date someone decent.	So kid, you going to tell me what happened up there. I mean, its quiet the mess. You say your hamster did this?	Sam shifted his weight from one bum cheek to the next. As we said, Sam knows the drill - do not spill your guts (no pun intended) to a police officer without a lawyer present. Everyone knows that. But Sam isn't thinking now. They found Mr Simpson's head but hes lost his face.	We were having breakfast. Sam sobs. Me, my mom and dad, pancakes with bacon and syrup because its Saturday and mom always makes pancakes on a Saturday morning. She never gets the bacon crispy enough though, not like they do at I Hop.	I like crispy bacon too.	I bet you do, Sam thinks, eyeing Officer Water's girth, and continues with his story. ""I was just about to help myself to another when Charlotte starts screaming like she is being mauled by a werewolf or something; 'Mom! Mom! Sam's hamster is eating my underwear. Mom!'	Mom gives me the biggest death stare. Sam!	What? I didnt put him there.	""'We say pardon in this household, not what"", My father interjected.	""'Did you put your hamster in your sister's underwear draw?'	It takes every bit of inner strength I posses not to lol. I can see the blood drain from Mom's face, and my sister wails and weeps upstairs, ""Mom!"" Mom is white with rage. She snatches the plate in front of me away, knocking over my OJ, and she does so. 'Now look what you made me do?'	""Mom is freaking out, though not as much as my sister, who comes screaming down the stairs, a towel wrapped around her, 'Mom! What am I going to wear? I'm meeting Gunner for breakfast in like 30 minutes.'	""'Sam, get upstairs and get that hamster out of your sister's draw. Right now!'	""'But I haven't finished eating.' I protest.	""'Now! Better still,' she turns towards me, threatening me with a silicon egg flip. ""You can get rid of that hamster. Today! Once and for all.""	Mom, hes my only friend.	Gone today. Otherwise, I will get rid of it, and trust me young man, Im not shy about sending it down the garbage disposal.	Mom!	Dad says something. Hes such a wimp. Does my head in sometimes. There are two girls in this family and three boys if you include Roger. You'd think we controlled the place right? Nope. Dad is a pussy and always sides with the girls, leaving Roger and me in the minority.	""'Sam, do as your mother says.'	""I scuttle upstairs, get Roger out from my sister's underwear drawer, and retreat to my room, land myself on the end of my bed, cupping Roger in my hand. I hold his whiskered face up to mine and look into his tiny dark round eyes. ""I wish you were big, like a gorilla, then they wouldn't be threatening to send you down the garbage disposal. Then you'd have some respect.'	""'I popped him back into his tiny hamster home, jumped onto Facebook, and posted that I was giving away my hamster to a good home. This was just for show; there was no way Roger was leaving my side.	""Mom found my sister some clean undies to wear, and dad took me to my football game; we won 2-1 in extra time and everyone seemed to have forgotten about this morning. I got a few likes on my Facebook post, but no one said they would take Roger away - which was just what I wanted. Then, Saturday night rolled around; I was lying on my bed listening to some music when there was a knock at the door.	""'Sam.' It was mom. 'Mr Simpson from next door is downstairs. He saw your Facebook post and said he is happy to take Roger. He has a nephew who would love a new pet. So, pack him up and bring him downstairs, okay? Sam?'	What? I couldnt believe my ears. She wasnt really going to make me give away Roger was she	""'Now, Sam.'	But mom. I cried back.	Now!	""She handed me a Nike shoe box. I scooped Roger out of his cage and placed him inside. 'Get 'em,' I whispered into his little fury ear and kissed him on the top of the head. He looked up at me, and I swear he winked as if to say, 'I've got this.' I stood at the top of the stairs, watched mom give Mr Simpson the box holding Roger and turned as I heard the door closing. Not a second had passed when we all heard a huge roar followed by a scream. Mom ran to the door, opened it, and became hysterical, slamming the door shut and running up the stairs, 'Jeff, Charlotte, Sam, hide!'.	And thats when I saw Roger, the size of a gorilla, come stomping up the stairs, blood dripping from his front two teeth. I ran to my room, slammed the door shut and covered my ears with my hands as the house filled with the screams of my family as my hamster massacred my family.	Bingo. Sally thought. What a story. I might be able to buy that condo outright.	Wow kid, some story. Wheres the hamster now.	""Upstairs, in his house. Once he had finished, I went to the landing and found him in front of my bedroom door, back to his normal size. I picked him up, put him back in his cage, and called 911. I should never have made that wish.	Sally took the phone from her pocket, closed the voice recorder app, and opened the camera app. Wait here kid. Dont move. Ill be back.	Gingerly she took a step towards the door, then another and another before she started to move her bulky frame with determination. She needed photos, and now. She bounded up the stairs, past the wall of blood-sprayed photos of smiling privilege, past the forensic team with their flash cameras and tweezers going over every detail, past where Sam's dad lay, his throat torn to shreds. Sally takes her first photo. Wow, she thought. This is going to be so easy. No one noticed her, not the forensic guys, the uniformed officer, and the detectives. This is her life story; no one notices Sally Waters.	Next, she sees the sister's room. She pukes but holds it in her mouth and swallows. It's rough, her stomach churns, and she now wishes she hadn't eaten that last doughnut. She even begins to tremble in horror as she takes her photos, the pure merciless brutality of the slayings. And the blood. How could a 14-year-old do this?	Sally carefully steps around body parts, pools of more blood and gizzards as she tiptoes towards Sam's room. Posters of Marvel superheroes and some Spanish football clubs are tacked to the walls, and against the far wall is a bookcase sagging under the weight of R L Stine novels, dozens of them. Sally has no idea who that is. And there, sitting outside of his cage, licking what must be blood from his paws, is Roger.	Officer, I thought I told you to look after the kid. Johnson barks from across the room.	Sally thinks quick.	Hes cold sir. I thought Id come up and get him a jacket.	The detective rolls his eyes; Sally raises her camera to take a photo of Rodger and sees that he has disappeared.	Theres a collective gasp.	Then a brutal growl.	She sees a uniformed officer reach for his holster.	Someone, something, tapped Sally on the shoulder.	She turns	She wants to scream, but only a hiss of air leaves her mouth.	She drops her phone.	Someone is pushing her from behind, screaming run.	But Sallys feet dont move.	She is transfixed by the six-foot-high hamster that is bearing down on her. It's two giant front teeth - as perfect as that kid's downstairs  tear at her throat, ripping the life out of her. She can't scream, there is nothing to cry with, and so she falls, her blood spray painting the kid's bedroom a bright red; her last moment of life is hearing a bullet rip through the skull of Roger."
Brother broke Grandma's urn and lied about it.,"Looking back on it, I think my brother did our family a favor. Of course, I didnt like being the least favored child from that point on after he broke grandmas ash urn. That moment still lingers in my head; the grey ash spread all over the carpet like a gruesome glitter bomb in front of the fireplace. The way it caked and dusted itself all over the carpet and walls. A little got on us both, but the moment mom screamed and saw us both there, he was the fastest one to point the finger at me. The little bastard was always a liar, always cheating. Although I was the big brother, he would be the one to pull the unplugged controller trick on me in the middle of Smash Bros. He left me with the punishment and the duty to put grandmas ashes into a plastic bag until we could get a new urn.The punishment was a sentence of being grounded for two months. No video games, no friends' house, nothing, so those two months wouldve been agony. Every day was a saw-like torture session of pure, uninterrupted boredom, and I couldnt deck my brother because that would just make things worse. He would leer at me from the stairs, and never in my life had I ever seen him play so much GameCube in a short time frame.My brother did give mom all sorts of affection during this time, feeling guilty about what he did but never wanting to admit it. Grandma was a blur in my lifethe woman was a mystery, and we didnt visit her much. The last time I saw her alive was back when I was nine, and when she lost her battle with lung cancer, my mom lost it. She would scream at dad whenever he tried to go out to see his friends, even if they didnt smoke. Yet, dad would always comfort us, saying that she just needed time to process.Mom wouldve only gotten back to her old self in the last month of my punishment and three months after her death. Dad could go with his friends again to drink and go hunting, but my mother still wouldnt give up her constant attention on my brother. She would shower him with concern; are you sure youre eating enough?, Are you getting enough rest, honey?. I only leered at him as he looked solemnly back at me. He wouldnt cough it up, so he got to stay home from school that day as I sulked over to the bus stop, cursing under my breath.When my brother and I returned home, mom and dad would be gone, leaving us alone to do homework or just screw around. He was still lying on the couch and playing the sick act like Daniel Radcliff. All I did was shoot him a look and go back into the kitchen to get something to eat. A peanut butter sandwich is all I would eat, and after fixing it up, I slammed the jar back into the cabinet. Afterward, I heard something fumble onto the ground in the living room. Peeking into the room, I saw my brother wrapped up in blankets and his boney, white chest pumping rapidly.What's up with you? I grumbled, yet he didnt say anything. Fine. He would sleep on the couch that night, what I thought was faking being too sick to go to his bed.It was around thirteen at the time. Yet, It had been four years since I had smelled the musk of tobacco gas in the air. It was like someone lit a cigarette and waved it in front of my nose while I slept. It made me nauseous with how strong it was, so I ran to the bathroom. No one in the house smoked, and my alarm clock lit red at two in the morning. The only sound in the dead night was a sharp chirping of crickets, with something else I couldnt quite make out at the moment. The stairs creaked as I tried to make as little noise as possible, but a faint murmuringsomeone mumbling behind layers of walls. My brother was missing from his couch, and I thought he was just rambling about his bad dream with mom and dad.The smell of tobacco was growing more potent, and I pushed on into the dark. My eyes adjusted, seeing more. Below the crickets and the murmur, low wheezing crept into my ears from the fireplace. A white plastic bag sat where the urn used to be, next to a picture of dear, sweet grandma. When I first saw this, I thought it was just my brain being half asleep, and it probably was, but I saw the back inflate and deflate with the rhythm of the longing wheezing. Maybe it was the cool autumn air flowing through the cracks of the house, Im still not too sure, but the whispers were there, Im sure of it.That mumbling was seeping through the door of my parents room, and as I got closer, it became clear it was my mother talking. What exactly she was saying is still a mystery word for word, but I did hear a few fragments. I gave him a fair punishment and Its a dirty habit were the only two things that stood out to memostly because they were the only two things that were clear to me.When she went back to sleep, the tobacco smell started to disappear, and I turned around to see my brother shaking in his blanket. A jolt struck me, and I almost screamed. Jesus Christ, dude! Whats wrong with you?Is she gone? He said.What?Is she gone? The blanket rumbled as his thin body shook. She wont leave us alone. Im sorry. He turned away, crawled back into the couch, and just fell back to sleep as if he didnt say anything at all. The following morning, my brother and I went back to school. He said he was starting to feel much better. Its better now because after my punishment is over, my mothers biased parenting subsided. My brother is now grounded; he started smoking behind the school. Of course, he lied, saying he didntI could smell tobacco smoke on his clothes."
The Innocent One,"You ever get accused of doing something you didnt do?Well, I have.And it aint too grand, Stan!The only thing worse is getting grounded for something you didnt do.It hurts.Really!I know.You get this real bad feelin right in your gut like you ate too much candy before breakfast the mornin after Halloween. That feelin stays there cause no one will believe you.  Like maybe once you did do something and didnt get caught. Maybe sometimes you did. And this time you really didnt do a darn thing, but everyone thinks you did. Then your dad says, Go to your room, son! You ever notice how they always call you  when theyre mad at you. Well, anyway, youre sittin there in your room like I am right now.So I can Only I didnt have any actions!CAN YOU HERE ME DOWN THERE?!I DIDNT DO ANYTHING!CAN YOU HEAR MEEEEEEEE?! I guess they cant.Theyre all watchin TV havin a good time and Im stuck up here.   Its a good thing they didnt hear me. Dad would make a  up here to give me one of those conversations with me.Vinnie, youre 8 years old and you have to take your punishment like a man. And I would look at him nodding my head, but I wouldnt hear a word he said.Why?Well . . . I dont know why.Cause Im mad.Thats why! Im sittin up here lookin at a spot on the ceiling from when the roof leaked last summer.And the more I look at it, the more it looks like the shape of Bart Simpsons head and neck.I aint kiddin.But I dont wanna talk about that, okay? Where was I?Oh, yeah.I said I was mad, right? And Im sittin up here while everyone else is downstairs watchin TV.Yeah, thats it.Well, it burns me up.  Ill fix em.Ill runaway.Yeah, thats what Ill do.See how theyd like that. Theyll come up to my room tomorrow morning and yell, Vinnie, Vinnie, time to get up, dear.Thats my mom for ya.Rise and shine, my big boy. Time to get up.Its already past six. Then when I didnt come down theyd send Becky.When she walked in Id have a picture of her boyfriend Todd on my dresser.And Id have a black marker mustache on him.HA! Shed scream and the family that wrongly punished a really good kid... ( would find an empty room.And a note: My dear ex-family, 	I know that this will be hard for you, but Ive decided to runaway. 	I really didnt take Beckys music player. I know you found it in	my room, but it wasnt me.  Got it!?  	Maybe Grandma put it there.  You know how forgetful she gets.	Or maybe Becky left it there herself when she was having one of	her a secret conversations with Toddsie-Woddsie. 	Maybe Baby Matt climbed outta his crib and did it.	You never believed me that time I told you I found	him at the head of the stairs about to have his first	lesson at the Jackie Chan Falling School.I saved his	life.Look, if you wanna know what I think, maybe it	was a ghost that did it.All I know is it wasnt me.	But you wont believe me.All I can say is goodbye,	adios, so long.Love, Vinnie PS. Ill write when I can. (I doubt it seriously.) PPS. Dont worry about me. Ive got nine dollars saved. PPPS. You lost a good son. PPPPS. A real good son. PPPPPS. Me, thats who! Boy, that would fix em. Mama would be crying and Dad would say, I shoulda been nicer to that boy. He was the best son a dad could ever have. Who will I take to batting practice, now? Who will I teach the restaurant business to?"" Then theyd all turn to Becky and blame her. Its all your fault!Mom, Dad and Baby Matt all at the same time... cept Baby Matt... 'cause he cant even talk that good. Theyd probably call the police.Everyone would be looking for me everywhere.Ha!Id be on the front page of the newspaper: FAMILY SEARCHES FOR FAVSON TO BEG FORGIVENESS But Id be long gone, probably to Timbuktu wherever that is. But wherever that is Id be there. All by myself.I could get a job. Yeah, thats what Id do. Id show em. Id start at the bottom ...a roadie for some rock n roll band. A cool one. But Id work my way up to lead singer. People would be screamin for me everywhere Id go. But nobody would recognize me cause Id dye my hair and have a real weird hair-do, like one of those all-messed-up-on-purpose kinda hair-dos. The fan magazines would interview me and ask, Tell us about your parents, Mister . . . uh, whats your name? Id tell em . . ..Yeah, thatd be a great name.And Im an orphan from, where can I be from? . . . uh, I know, from Germany. Will you speak some German for your German fans, Mr. Innocent One? No, I just lost my accent and I dont wanna get it back, Id say. () Boy, thatd be so great! Me, the lead singer in the number one rock n roll band in the world. I could probably afford a zillion music players. Id buy a hundred of em and send em all to Becky, just to show her. No. Scratch that. Then theyd know it was me and I was all right. I dont wanna let them off the hook that easy. Naw, make em sweat. They did it to themselves. They had a son and they blew it Big Time! Too bad, so sad, Im glad! Okay, so here I am on TV about to receive my Grammys ...and an Oscar, too, for my latest album and video.  First time ever they gave one guy both at the same time. I go to accept and say, Id like to thank all my fans for believing in me. Youre the best! And you guys in the band, I couldnt have done it without you. And my parents, I wish I could thank you, but I cant cause you never would believe me when I told you that I didnt touch Beckys music player. After I did that speech on TV and my face was everywhere theyd find out it was me. Then theyd all come to my house. Vinnie, is it okay if we call you , Mister Vance? my dad would ask. Id say, I dont know, Andy.Boy, that would hack his berries callin him by his first name. We just came over to say were sorry for the way we treated you, son... I mean, Mister Vance.And we realize now that it was a ghost just like you said.We didnt believe you cause Becky talks on the phone too much.But she couldnt help it cause shes a teenager. Please, cant you find it in your heart to forgive us so we can come live with you? And Mom would plead, Ill make French toast and let you have that cereal with all the extra sugar and preservatives in it. And Becky would say, Im sorry. You were the best brother in the world. Here, you can have my music player, Mister Vance, and Ill only talk an hour after school with Todd. And Baby Matt would say . . . uh something. Im not really mad at him. Then I would say, Nobodys perfect.I forgive you.Wed all be so happy again.All I wanted was for you to believe me.  my dad called from downstairs. (Uh-Oh) I could hear him coming up the stairs. Yes, Dad, I yelled and went to open the door.When I looked out, he was at the head of the stairs walking towards my room. I made a special trip up here to see how youre doing and to have a man-to-man talk with you. Youve been kinda quiet, he said and closed the door. , I said to myself, but then to him I said, Great, Dad. Been thinking everything over? he asked. Yes, Dad. You have to admit that story about the ghost was pretty far out there, huh, son? He smiled. I nodded. We were just trying to get to the bottom of this.Were a family and we have to learn to respect each others things, he said as he stuck his finger at me. But, Dad . . . No buts about it, son. You have to agree with my basic premise, dont you? Which one is that? I asked. The one I just spoke of:  We, as a family, living together, have to respect each others property, Hands on hips.  Yes, Dad. Good, lets put this behind us.Come on, down and watch TV with the rest of the family, Vinnie. Cool! I said and started out the door. When we got to the stairs I turned to him and asked, Dad, man-to-man, do you believe in ghosts? VINNIE! Okay, Im sorry, Andy... Say, you dont mind if I call you , do you? Youre pushin your luck, kid."
What Happens in The Kitchen,"Charlie Cobbler fought his urge to collapse once he heard the tea kettle whistle. He had spent the past nine hours on outlet duty, running electrons from their source, the wall outlet, through various electric cords, and delivering them by the bucketful to workers all over the kitchen in different appliances. It was exhausting work that should have been handled by a younger elf. But, these days Charlie would do any job his foreman would give him.	His last delivery had brought him to the microwave, which gave him the perfect view of Mrs. Lovitz entering the kitchen to pour her afternoon tea. She had a cup at the same time every day, so Charlies superiors deemed it wise to have shift changes happen at the sound of her kettles whistle. She was a slender woman, who was growing into middle age with grace that reminded Charlie of his wife.	Move it oldtimer! cried a young elf with overalls and a pointy hat like Charlies and a jaw like an anvil. Mister Lovitzll be home any minute, and you know theyre having leftovers tonight. We need this microwave clear of all nonessentials.	Charlie had been called nonessential so many times, the word had started to lose its meaning. He almost thanked the rude, young elf for distracting him from the incoming thoughts of his late wife. Charlie didnt need any more rumors of him losing control of his emotions in his old age.	He left through the microwaves back entranceall appliances have oneand dropped down to the counter.	Mrs. Lovitz was singing a tune to herself that Charlie found quite vulgar, but she probably found it nostalgic. thought Charlie, 	Charlie stepped over to the wall, which was covered in white tile. Every few squares, there was a smaller black tile that was tilted to the side. He walked up to the nearest one and gave the secret knockthe one that humans cant hear. The tile pulled back into the wall and slid to the side making a large door for Charlie to enter the elf section of the house.	The door opened to a large roomby elf standardswith long tables occupied by hundreds of elves who had finished shifts as long as Charlies but seemed half as tired. Charlie went for his usual meal after a long shift: a cup of cold coffee. He grabbed a small cup and dipped it into the thimble filled with the glorious liquid taken from the Lovitzs coffee pot every morning as payment for services rendered.	Charlie rested his decaying, yet living corpse on the nearest seat. He preferred to sit alone after a long shift, but that wasnt always possible. When Charlie was a young man, one small family of elves was all it took to run a house. Nowadays, it takes hundreds to run one room. So many appliances, so many cables, so many elves.	He may have preferred his previous work making shoes, but he didnt hate his current job. He couldnt hate any job. Thats what separated elves from humans. With humans, everything is a transaction. They work for money. They marry for their own pleasure.Elves were selfless. They worked for the satisfaction of an honest days work, taking only a pittance like the coffee Charlie drank. They married for the satisfaction of their partners. Charlies eye twitched as it prepared tears. His thoughts wandered to the past when he and his wife would argue about how they could better serve each other.He wanted to keep them stable, staying in the same place as long as possible. But, she knew that Charlie wanted adventure. She was the one who always pushed him to try new things and go to new places. The greatest centuries of his life were with her.It was a beautiful time that Charlie didnt dare remember. Carolina was gone, and like a productive Elf, Charlie would redirect the energy he used to spend on her to his work.A high-pitched bell rang and every elf in the cafeteria silenced themselves and looked up to the source of the sound. It came from the opposite end of the room from the door where Charlie sat. The bell was small enough to be carried in an elfs tiny hand, making an appropriately small size that could only be heard with an elfs pointed ears.The elf ringing the bell was their foreman. He was too young for the positiona mere four hundred and fifty. And, he never wore the traditional pointy hat of an elf. Instead, he wore a combover for his bald spot. The worst part about him was his refusal to be addressed by anything other than his first name, Brandon. It was unprofessional and made every conversation with him awkward for Charlie. All the young elves adored him.Id like to have your attention, said Brandon. Has Charlie come back from his shift yet?Charlie was a common enough name among elves. Maybe he was looking for someone else?The crowd murmured amongst themselves, seeking an answer to Brandons question.Cobbler, said Brandon. Has anyone seen Charlie Cobbler?	The other Elves snickered. Most Elves took the name of the job they fulfilled. There were plenty of Transistors and Resistors in the crowd. But, no other Cobblers. It had been Charlies wifes idea to keep their name when they started working in private residences. She thought it would keep them proud of where they came from. She was a smart woman, but she was wrong in that instance.Charlie sighed, then rose. Here sir.	Ah, Brandon looked happy to see him, could I see you in my office for a moment, Charlie?	He didnt need to ask permission. He should have ordered Charlie to report to his office and threatened to sack him if he didnt comply in a timely enough fashion.	Of course sir.	Charlie rounded the edge of the room, trying to ignore the snickers of those who looked at him as if he were a bratty child on his way to being punished by the schoolmaster.	Brandon was already on his way back to his office through a red, circular door. Charlie followed after him, opening the door to the support beams, which doubled as highways for Elves all over the house.They passed the nursery where young Elves were being taught how a television remote worked. An elf would hide inside and listen to the buttons a human clicked. Then, the elf used a small mirror to send codes to the elves that ran the television. The codes were complex. Charlie had tried to memorize them, hoping to find a job in the living room, but he was too old to learn such complex work.	Charlie and Brandon made it to a small, humble door with a plaque that read, CHIEF SUPERVISOR OF KITCHEN.	Brandon held the door open for Charlie. Another breach of protocol.	Charlie tried to set things right. After you sir, he gestured to the open door.	Brandon smiled, refusing to move. I insist, you first.	Charlie had no other alternative. He entered first.	Brandons office was too comfortable for Charlies tastes. There were two sardine cans, one on each wall. The tops of the cans were peeled off and the insides were stuffed with dried grass from outside. They were heavenly to sit on. Charlies legs and back were soothed by the sight of them. But, Charlie didnt find it appropriate to feel at ease in his foremans office. In the corner, there was a pile of trash. Dozens of papers carpeting the floor with no organizational method.	Brandon jumped onto one of his cans as if it were a bed and let out a yawn. Take a load off Charlie. Ive got something I want to talk to you about.	Charlie hoped it wouldnt be what his mind was already assuming. Of course, sir. He sat down on the opposite can as if it were a couch. His weary limbs thanked him for doing so.	I insist you call me Brandon. I dont want to be called sir or anything else.	All the comfort Charlie felt on the couch vanished. If you insist Brandon.	Youve been pulling a lot of shifts, Charlie. Arent you getting tired?	Charlie supposed there were worse things than lying to your boss. Losing your job was at the top of that list. I feel fine.	I went over your records. You started doing this after Carolina passed. He seemed sincere, but Charlie wished he wouldnt say his wifes name. You do realize that filling your time with work isn't going to help you get over the pain, dont you?	With respect, sir, Charlies tone was as firm as he dared to go when speaking to a superior, is it not customary for an elf to dedicate himself to his work after the death of his spouse?	Brandon paused for a moment, considering his response. Yes, but isnt that a little old-fashioned?	Sir he remembered his request and corrected himself, Brandon, I am over nine-hundred years old. I am a little old-fashioned.	Brandon sat up, mirroring Charlies position on the opposite can. At the rate youre going, youll work yourself to death. And, that might not be an exaggeration.	Charlie stood and adjusted his overalls to make sure they looked smart. Then, so be it. Would an elf ever be prouder than to be found dead at his post after excelling at his work for his house?	Brandon started to speak, butin a move that shocked himselfCharlie interrupted him. Id like to get started back to work as soon as possible. Please assign me to the next shift. With that, Charlie started for the door.	You got off a double shift, Brandon said. You must be exhausted.	Someone must show these young elves how to do a good job. Charlies hand was on the small door knob.	Thats the thing, Charlie. Brandons tone turned dour, like how the doctors had when he told Charlie that his wifes condition wasnt going to improve. Youve not been doing a good job.	Charlie spun around, realizing the true reason he was here.	Brandon couldnt look Charlie in the eye. Your productivity is way down. You cant run through a power cable, delivering electrons with the same speed a younger elf can.	The truth was spoken. And, it was the worst possibility Charlies mind could imagine. It was something he already knew to be fact. But, in the past, he could lie to himself and say that the other elves wouldnt mind if he were a little slower than them. They could learn from his wisdom and experience. What foolishness.	Charlies anger subsided as he realized there was nothing for him to do but retire. Hed spend the rest of his days wandering across the support beams, chatting with those whod bother to take an interest, living without purpose. Being alone.	Charlie never could have imagined himself crying in front of his foreman. He wasnt some young pup being chewed out for the first time. But, he was weeping, unable to control the fear and sadness inside him from leaking out in a liquid form.	Brandon stood, walked over to Charlie, and embraced him. Itll be okay.	Charlie understood his soon-to-be former employers predicament. No one wanted a sad, old elf crying in their office. But, he also wanted to slap Brandon for patronizing him. How can you say any of this is okay? Youre condemning the rest of my life to misery.	Brandon actually laughed. Isnt that a little dramatic?	Certainly not! Charlie knew hed regret his words and tone later, but hed say his peace. You want to rid me of the one thing that brings me satisfaction because I dont measure up to your productivity quota. You are a cruel elf, with no sense of dignity, nor true appreciation of your employees.	Charlie! Brandon brought his hands up as if he were trying to calm him. Let me finish before you bite my head off. I knew you wouldnt want to give up work entirely, so I sent out a few letters about you.	The embarrassment Charlie anticipated earlier hit him like a hammer. You did what?	Ill be honest, most of the elves I contacted didnt like the idea of hiring someone pushing a thousand. But, a cousin of mine seemed interested. Brandon walked to the back of his office to a pile of papers stacked in the corner.	Charlie had assumed the papers were part of a trash pile. He was surprised as Brandon skimmed through the pile, snatched up a folded sheet, and brought it over for Charlie to read. There must be some system in place that Charlie had never considered.	Hes gonna run a new factory in the city as soon as it opens up. He thinks you would be a great asset.	The momentary hope that Charlie had vanished. He refused to take the paper. I have never worked in a factory. Eight hundred years ago, I worked in a cobblers shop, and have been in private residences for the past several centuries. I am too old to learn a new trade. Thank you for trying to help. And, I am so sorry for speaking to you the way I did.	Brandon cocked an eyebrow. He grabbed Charlie by the wrist and placed the folded paper in his hand. Read the letter.	Charlie unfolded it. His eyes struggled to read the small letters, but the point came across as a smile formed on Charlies face. Its a shoe factory?	Brandon nodded. He needs an expert on how shoes were made in the old days. He wants to bring back that elf quality that shoes have been missing. But, Ill only write back to my cousin if you promise you wont work yourself too hard.	Charlies hands shook as he read the letter over and over. But, his thoughts kept going back to Carolina, and how she always pushed him to new adventures. He supposed one more wouldnt hurt."
I'll Never Desert You,"My eyes fluttered open at the first light of day. Grayish hues scattered across the dawn-lit sky, the ambient rays of the rising sun peaking over the distant horizon, and beaming down trace amounts of warmth to a cold desert. I sat up and watched it for a bit, my eyes blinking lazily while I tried to find the energy to get myself up. I wished I could stay, lay on the soft grass, and enjoy the full extent of the morning, but unfortunately, duty called. I looked around the hidden oasis.	Everything seemed so still and beautiful at this hour. I yawned, did a couple of stretches to get the blood moving, and then stood.I started making my way over to the center of the oasis where the waters pooled, its' surface as smooth as glass. Along the way, I passed the boulder where Mr. Lizard waited for the sun to warm his reptilian blood.	Hello, Mr. Lizard, I said. How are you this fine morning?	Mr. Lizard slowly craned his head up at me and blinked each eye.	Good, I suppose, he grumbled.	Oh, come now. Today looks like it's gonna be a good one.	Mr. Lizard closed his eyes, flattened himself out, and mumbled something I could not understand.	What? I asked.	Talk to me later, Gary.	Oh. 	 	There was a flapping of wings overhead and then a falcon perched itself atop one of the trees bordering the waters of the oasis.	Ahh, Gary! she called, good morning to you.	Good morning, Ms. Falcon, I said with a smile. What news do you bring?	So far, it looks like you might have three today.	Three you say?	Yup, they are walking the South Dune trail and have been for some time now. Theyll need a resupply of water before nightfall. Better get moving.	Thanks for the update.	Ms. Falcon screeched, flapped her wings, and departed to the north. I made my way over to the pool and leaned over its reflective edge, my long neck craning down to its pristine surface. Staring back at me was my reflection: A smiling, happy camel. I loved my job of bringing water to people in need. It was a trade I learned from my former master.	A great man he was, possessing nothing but the desire to help others in need. He lived out here, in this oasis, living a hermits life and he was my most cherished friend. During the day, we would walk the dunes together, looking for weary travelers, and every night, when we would return, we would gaze up at the night sky while he gently pet me behind the ear until I fell asleep. Unfortunately, a few years back, he accidentally stepped on a scorpion's nest and the vile things stung him. He died but I vowed to continue what he started, delivering water to people in need until I drew my last breath.	Just as I had done many times before, I began transferring mouthfuls of water into a 3ft wooden barrel with a leather strap attached to it. It was a tedious chore, and just as I was finishing, Mrs. Squirrel and her family came from their burrow and sat next to me. Once done, the family hoisted the nearby wooden lid and used its latches to secure it to the barrel. I slid my head through the strap, and Mrs. Squirrel adjusted the neck pad. Then, I hoisted the barrel up and allowed it to slide down to the base of my neck. Once the family fitted the strap, I started on my journey.	Have a good day at work, Gary! Mrs. Squirrel called.	Thanks! I shouted back and then set out across the sandy dunes in search of the three travelers. 	After about 12 miles, I came across the first who struggled his way up a large dune. As I approached, he looked at me, his black eyes peering through the long, gray scarf wrapped around his head and covering his face from the sun. The pack he carried looked dangerously flat. We walked toward each other and, once together, I stood still while he filled his water skins from the barrel. When he was finished, he reached up and pet the top of my head. I smiled.	Thank you, the man said and then patted my hump and continued on his way. 	A few hours later, I found the second traveler and replenished his water supply. After scratching me beneath my chin and petting my neck, he too continued on his way. 	 	I hunted the dunes for the third traveler but, as the suns heat intensified, I started to fear the worst. I had about another hour left before I had to turn around and head back to the oasis as the desert wasnt safe at night. Thats when the predators came out and they loved to ambush unsuspecting prey. Just as I was about to give up, I saw a small shape in the distance, laying on the shaded side of a large dune. 		I ran as fast as I could, water sloshing around in the barrel with each trot, some of it dripping out through the tap. When I finally saw what it was, I gasped. It was an adolescent man. A nervousness took hold of me. Young men made up for most of those who died in the desertalways wanting to push the boundaries of their limitations but lacking the experience to do so.	I ran to him. He did not move. I placed one of my feet on his chest and slowly rocked him back and forth. He still did not move. I kicked him. He did not make a sound. Eventually, I did the one thing my late master told me never to do and spat. The thick globule of saliva hurtled through the hot air with deadly accuracy, splattering on his face. 	Finally, the man stirred, spittering and sputtering to keep the spit from entering his mouth. After he wiped his eyes with the back of his sleeve, he looked up at me as if I were sent from the heavens, and used my leg as a brace to pick himself up.	He filled his two canteens with water, drank half of one, and then filled it again. Finally, he pet my neck and said, Thank you, Mr. Camel. I would have been lost without you.I smiled and he continued on his way. I trailed behind him for a bit to ensure he was okay and then headed back to the oasis, arriving just as the sun touched the western horizon.	Gary! Mr. Lizard called once I was in sight. Howd you do today?	Three for three today.	Nice job.	I walked over to the pool and set the barrel down at the shore. After taking many gulps of water for myself and grazing on some grass, I laid down between two bushy shrubs. Mr. Lizard skittered over, climbed up my side, and started licking the back of my neck where the leather strap rubbed my skin raw. Once the numbing compounds of his saliva started to work their magic, I gave a lazy yawn and stared off toward the west and waited for the colors of the sunset to paint themselves across the sky. Just like the morning, all was still and quiet and it was times like these when I missed my master, terribly. I looked over to the side of the oasis. A bleached white skeleton lay atop a fertile patch of grass, bones picked clean, courtesy of Mr. Buzzard. A single tear streamed down my fuzzy cheek. 	 	Then, I lay my head down and was fast asleep, eager to start the next day."
Fables and Famine,"Content Warning: humorous fairy-tale references to child-eating witches.Once upon a time, an old woman lived in a shoe. She had so many children that she didnt know what to do. How an elderly dame beyond childbearing age acquired so many younglings when residing in a boot is a story for another day. Perhaps we might technically call it a cautionary tale.The rhyme next informed us that the poor, beleaguered caretaker fed her foundlings some broth without bread and sent them to bed. (Note: broth is even thinner than gruel, which is in turn poor mans porridge).Dear reader: have you ever seen a hungry child fall asleep without whinging incessantly? Or, for that matter, even a fully fed child? Perhaps we should revise that line to say that the aged lady tried to send them to bed. Except that the stanza no longer scans correctly due to the additional syllables. Phooey. Either way, this is where our yarn departs from the traditional narrative.Driven to distraction by the sniveling and lack of (blissfully quiet) snoozing children, the long-lived and long-suffering matriarch decided to visit her sister to ask for advice. Because she obviously wouldnt have any peaceful reading time after bedtime that night anyway. Oh you didnt know she had a sister? Just because she had all custody of all those children, you assumed she had no other family? Thats a little presumptuous and over-familiar, isnt it?Over their horrified objections, our heroine set the four oldest children (each a full fifteen or sixteen years old) in charge of the others for the remainder of the night and departed her leathery abode for the shadowy and silent woods. A pleasant breeze stirred the evening air, accompanied by the droning hum of crickets and the sporadic vocalizations of a particular vociferously opinionated owl., she thought. Briefly, she considered abandoning her errand altogether and absconding for the nearest market-town to escape her weighty responsibilities. Surely it would be far simpler to feed one mouth than elevensixteen twenty well, however many mouths it was that occupied her footwear residence. Yet she rapidly and reluctantly acknowledged the unseemliness of her speculation; rather than a flighty milkmaid of nineteen years, she was a mature widow with sixty-four winters behind her. She was supposed to be above such frivolity.Perhaps another venerable matron might have shrunk from entering the poorly illuminated woods where many dangerous fables and mythological beasts (and perhaps a jabberwocky or two) undoubtedly lived on a moon-dark night. Yet, as our story is set in the land of fairy-tales, it so happens that the ladys older sister was a witch. A very dangerous witch. In fact, let us acknowledge that the witch owned a cottage constructed of candy, cake, and other sweets, and that she subsisted primarily on a diet of small children who strayed into the forest.As all denizens of fairy-tale land who survive for more than a few decades have at least a passing acquaintance with the origin stories of their fellow residents, none of the other inhabitants of the forest would consider interfering with the shoekeeper due to her blood-relationship with the witch. Particularly after what happened to the last set of pigeons that dared to nibble on the witchs cottages gingerbread shuttersThus, the bold beldame resolutely set her feet on the thicket-overgrown path that led into the very depths of the woods. , she shrugged.As she penetrated into the dark heart of the forest, vines slithered serpentinely down tree trunks and groped towards her as if they had eyes and intelligence, winding ominously about her left ankle and tugging tentatively. Dead leaves and branches drenched in dew crunched underfoot, rendering her footing treacherous.Cease and desist! she barked. My patience grows slim tonight. You know who I am. Having ventured forth in search of my sisters wise counsel, I shall not be dissuaded by unnaturally animated vegetation. In fact, I could use some greens in my diet these days. Broth and gruel grow tedious quite rapidly.The vines promptly recoiled.Out of nowhere, as if rising from the very dirt beneath her feet, an indistinct figure appeared before her. Valiantly, she suppressed a startled jump. In the distance, as she peered between ominously gnarled trees, she could just make out the outlines of the witchs cottage. Now that she concentrated, she could also smell the same aroma of densely concentrated sugar that surrounded a bakery in the early morning hours. The shadow-shrouded individual stepped toward her.Bertha, gushed the witch with outstretched arms, as if they had not seen each other for ten years, rather than having drank tea together last Tuesday. I am delighted to see you. What urgent errand carries you into my woods this late on a moonless night?Giselle, she or, rather, answered. Surely you have guessed by now, dear reader!My sisters body felt comfortably soft and pillow-like in my arms. Shed clearly eaten heavily and recently. I hoped that meant there were no children currently caged in her hut; I could never fully suppress a feeling of helpless guilt during my visits when one was present. Their whimpering sobs made my crumpets taste oddly sour and my tea unnaturally salty. Yet I did not wish to starve my sister. I wish your counsel on an important matter, I continued, ending our embrace reluctantly.Is this an official or unofficial consultation? my sister demanded peckishly, crossing her arms over her chest. Because, if its official, you know a price must be paid in exchange for access to a witchs preternatural wisdom.I sighed.  An unofficial consultation only, I clarified.Are you certain? she pressed eagerly. You know my price. Could you not spare just a few children?No, Giselle. I cannot, I retorted. The rules that govern me are just as rigid as the rules that govern you. Would you be more comfortable with an informal question if I asked over tea?Bertha, its almost midnight, she answered flatly. No tea. Not even one?A night-cap, then? I parried.Letting out an impatient sigh, Giselle huffed, All right. Lets have it then.Dear sister, I began, choosing my words carefully to avoid any implication that I was posing a formal request for advice. As you might imagine, feeding fourteen seventeen twenty-one oh, however many children rapidly becomes quite expensive.I already told you I could help you with that, Giselle muttered under her breath. Its not my fault that you didnt like my first suggestion.Summoning up the withering look I generally deployed when the nefarious little spawn were attempting to garrote each other with my homes oversized boot-laces or engaging in similar socially impermissible activities, I firmly declared, I will not hear another word on this point, Giselle. I can no more deliver them to you than I could sell them into slavery. While witches are permitted to consume children, the conventions are quite clear that surrogate parents are prohibited from participating in such activity. Unless theyre wicked stepmothers, which Im not. That loophole is closed to me.Not even one of them was Waldos? she interrupted incredulously.No, Giselle. Sadly, none of them belonged to my dear late husband. Thus, I couldnt be a wicked stepmother and, thus, I couldnt funnel any surplus children in her direction.Then how did you end up with so many? she sputtered.I cleared my throat. Were traveling a bit far afield conversationally here, Giselle. Lets focus on the solution instead of fighting the hypothetical scenario. Just assume that I  to feed the children and I cant afford enough food for all of them. Youre the one with a house made of baked goods: whats your secret? Surely it cant be cheap to replace the various fixtures that have been devoured by passing children. Do you have some sort of inside connection with a reasonably priced bulk supplier?Oh, my sister scoffed dismissively. No such luck. I worked out a trade with a baker. He periodically requires four-and-twenty blackbirds to bake into a pie to set before one king or another. I transform the skinny children that I dont eat and the ones with sweet voices into blackbirds. He doesnt ask any awkward questions about where the birds come from and dedicates one day every fortnight exclusively to baking for me. Though I doubt I can renegotiate with him to obtain sufficient provender for your massive flock of foundlings. He already periodically wails that I am taking advantage of him and starving his family. Hardly likely: Ive seen the well-fed little butterballs he calls children. And to think he wont sell me any of  either she pouted, a gesture that highlighted her puffy lips and make her look rather like a fish. Kings must pay extremely well for singing pies. I dont suppose that, during any of your consultations youve encountered a wicked queen or a previously-cursed princess looking for household help? I tried instead. None of the children are particularly gifted when it comes to cleaning, but a few of them can do wonders in the kitchen with tree roots, mushrooms, the occasional pile of unripe berries, and bone-marrow. Im sure that with some brief training and access to the standard contents of a castle pantry, they could become excellent cooks.Giselles eyes closed briefly and a disturbing smile, composed of equal parts smugness and wistful hunger, crossed her wrinkled features. Ah, bone-marrow, she sighed. I do so like to crack their brittle little bones and spread the gooey insides along my rolls like jam. Honestly, Bertha, are you truly,  certain?Giselle, I grated through clenched teeth. I really need you to move past the idea of eating your honorary nieces and nephews. Besides, we dont have enough food. Theyre too skinny to eat, unlike the human veal you usually cage up. And they would make terrible blackbirds to bake in a pie: they would squawk and squabble raucously rather than sing. Trust me: I already would have sent some of them out to sing for their supper if they showed any musical talent whatsoever.My sister blinked. Then her yellowy eyes widened. Honorary nieces and nephews? Huh. I never considered it that way before. Youre right: it seems a step too far for even me to devour family. Wait a moment. Let me see what yarn I can weave with that particular skein that might change your rhyme-scheme.She reached into thin air and muttered something. A thick book simply fell into her hands.Quickly, she thumbed through the pages. Nieces and nephews nieces and nephewsAfter a moment, she looked up and paused. Ah, here we go. An wicked witch for a godmother or, in some retellings, an aunt. I could enchant a spindle to put them to sleep for a hundred years, until theyre full-grown. If theyre unconscious, they dont need to eat. You would just have to figure out how to make them each prick their finger on it in turn. Surely some would become wise to the trick after watching the first few fall into near-deathly slumber.But wouldnt I have to fall asleep for a hundred years along with them? And wouldnt thorns sprout all around my shoe? I objected. That sounded like an extreme solution. Also, dangerously likely to result in punctures. Dont laugh, reader: do you know how much a cobblers services cost when including travel expenses to leave their shop and patch a building-sized shoe? I already cant afford to feed the children as it is!Hmmm, thats true. It would put a massive damper on the mahjong group if you were incapacitated for a hundred years. We might have to find a new fourth, Giselle conceded.I gasped in outrage. You wouldnt dare! Those are  tiles!All right, all right. We cant weave that pattern then. Lets see if we can find something else more appropriate. Adjusting the wire-frame spectacles perched on the bridge of her pointy and generously be-warted nose, Giselle began to rifle through the book once more, pages whisking rapidly like moths wings.After several moments, she looked up once more. I have rediscovered a classic. Its not a yarn in common usage and stretching the aunt relationship may ripple the weft slightly, but it might still do well enough.Im all ears, I exclaimed, stretching out my hands imploringly. Please, anything is better than the pattern were currently working with!Are any of your foundlings particularly lazy? Giselle inquired with careful precision.Contemptuously, I snorted. A bakers dozen. Take your pick.Dont tempt me, Bertha. Im trying to behave here. Are any of the lazy ones also adolescent girls who know how to spin?. I thought hard for a moment. Spinning wasnt generally a part of our everyday lives. Im reasonably sure Ella knows how to spin. Shes sixteen years old, give or take a year, and shes one of the laziest of the lot.Excellent! Giselle slammed the weighty tome shut and tossed it casually into midair, where it disappeared once more, without hitting the ground. Go home and tell her that her name is now Sarah.I blinked. Wait, what? Without responding to the interruption, Giselle continued, Next, in a few days, beat her for her constant laziness.Even as I opened my mouth to object, she barked, All right! I dont believe you  have to beat her! Just reprimand her loudly and threaten to beat her. Since you claimed her to me as an honorary child a few minutes ago, you should be close enough to being her mother to warp the pattern in the correct direction. I hope. Rolling her eyes, she muttered, Faint-hearted softie, under her breath. I didnt think she was referring to Ella.As soon you do that, a queen should stop by your house I mean, shoe Now, this part is important: whatever you do, do  tell the queen that Sarah is lazy. Instead, you must tell her that Sarah is such a good spinner that you cant buy enough flax to keep her busy. In fact, thats why youre so poor that you live in a shoe. Because you spent all your money on flax. You want me to lie to royalty? I asked incredulously. That sort of behavior results people being cursed or beheaded! What if the queen ends up being a wicked queen? How badly do you need food and wealth again? No risk, no reward. If you cling closely enough to the archetype, you should be safe. If this all works out correctly, the queen will take Sarah back to her castle and offer to marry Sarah to the prince if she can spin an entire room full of flax within three days.But Sarah cant spin an entire room full of flax in three days! I protested.Of course she cant! Thats precisely the point. During the third night, when shes on the verge of failure, three women will show up in the room and offer to help her as long as she calls them her aunts and invites them to her wedding to the prince. One will have a deformed foot, one will have a massive thumb, and one will have a fat lip. She gestured to her own face. Ill recruit two of my coven sisters and well cheat a little by using magic to spin for her. If this tale-weaving holds, well enjoy a high quality, free dinner paid for by the queens coin (hopefully with steak), Sarah will marry a prince and never have to spin again, and you can demand a steady income from Sarah and her rich husband to feed her siblings. I just hope that no pies sing at the wedding banquet.Wont you get in trouble for helping us out like this? After all, you are supposed to be a wicked witch.Giselle shrugged. Witches are still allowed to have families, even honorary ones. A witch tended and cherished Rapunzel for a time, after all. Once you claimed your brats as family rather than potential food, you made it possible for me to temporarily circumvent the rules that govern me. Ill go eat a few extra children lost in the woods, or pinch one of the bakers tender little morsels, and Ill be safely wicked again soon enough.And, so, we lived happily ever after. Until a little man with an extraordinarily long name fleeing another tale deposited his unwanted offspring on the threshold of my shoe"
The Brave Lad & The Chef,"Twas the boasting of the great and prideful orcish chef.Across these wild lands, they all say he is the best.But the brave little lad had no spare time to lend an ear,for a quest he was pursuing and off-track, he would not veer.For the land that he came from, his hometown was at stake. He mustnt dawdle one moment. He couldnt afford one mistake.But this chef blocked his passage and would not let him on his waytil the brave little lad challenged him to a cook-off on this day.The brave little lad was at an impasse with this chef,so agreeing to his demands was the only choice he had left.The brave little lad was not a talented cook, he knew.So what could he prepare that could help him see this through?Twas a frightening proposition the young lad face ahead,so he thought hard on a dish that may yet keep him not dead.While the young lad was no chef, there were some dishes that he knew,His mother taught him cooking, such as how to brew a simple stew.He thought for a while of all the dishes he could make,but none seemed right to protect him from his proposed dark fate.But since leaving on this journey, he had stayed in some friendly villages.Different people taught him new things. Perhaps he could use one of these dishes?A decent plethora of knowledge he had been obtaining along the way.But could that help him at this moment? It was rather tough to say.The lad checked his pack, and through his ingredients, he perused.He hoped something in there he would think of how to use.As the carnivorous orcish chef rushed the young lad to pick a course.From within his bag, he drew two fish he had collected from a port.They call it the Galerka fish, the young lad held them out.These shall be our dish! The fish were portly and stout.The Galerka fish has several small spikes in a row along its sides,they could withdraw and protrude through these holes that look like eyes.As the orcish chef gutted it, he saw the spikes met with the meat,but he snapped em free with ease. He didnt miss a beat.The young lad removed them with much more care and ease.He slid his blade in and detached the spikes. He made it look like a breeze.Oer the flames of the grill, they cooked their bizarre fish,The aroma was unusual; it was a salty, smelly dish.The orcish chefs flames climbed high up in the air,if they burned him, he did not notice; neither did he care.But the brave lads flames were much, much lower,but do you think that this cooked the fish any slower?As the smoke climbed up the chimney, it drew the attention of the wildlife.Their fish were cooked so tender they would cut without a knife.So they plated their fish dishes, and they cared little for presentation.This is all about taste and texture; no need for physical persuasion.First, they ate the lads fish, and it was salty as the sea,said the Orc chef, The orc ate down his own fish, and the lad just stood aside.the orc said with evident pride.But you see what the lad knew that the orcish chef did not,Galerka fish venom was deadly. Thats why few of these fish were caught.Well, that is to say, the females are. Their venom poisons their meat.The male meat is safe. One must know which fish is safe to eat.The lad had cooked the male. So his fish meat was safe.But the orc did not know that his dish held his fate.The poison ran down the orcs throat, but He did not feel it yet.Til it hit him in the stomach, he doubled over in distress.He threw up all his bile, for the poison made him ill.Then he finally gave in to it, and his body fell still.The lad looked at the orc who he bested on this day.He was sad he had to die, but there was no other way.The lad looked across the kitchen for something of the chefs.Sitting alone on the counter was something he had left.He had boasted to the lad that his sandwich was the best.The lad had to know, was it better than the rest?So he took a bite and tasted all its gooey cheesiness.If he had to describe it, he would say that this was bliss.He looked once more upon the orc, who had wanted the lad to eat.But hated him not. He felt bad that he gave him poisoned meat.I am sorry that you are dead now, and I dont think you were evil.But you must understand it is unkind to eat people.I must tell you, sir, your self-praise was no tease.You did, in fact, make the most delicious grilled cheese."
The Poison Tree,"Trees are wondrous things, from their strong trunks to their delicate leaves. They feed from the sun and feel its warm rays far longer than we humans do, pausing under their broad branches, perhaps to shelter from the rain; perhaps to listen to the rustling of the leaves, another language, just as expressive as our own. Sometimes we try to capture what the tree means to us in words; such things as , perhaps your dad has told you that; or  is a favourite of your mums. Enchanting words, plucked from those enchanting trees.But this story is about a different sort of tree; one whose fruit you should not pick and certainly not eat, however tempting it looks. This tree grows within the pages of fairy tale; it grew from a seed which should never have been sown, let alone been permitted to prosper: the seed of envy.This story begins long ago and far away and this is how it starts: there was a beautiful girl, an envious queen and a rosy apple, poisoned to the core. And who had poisoned it? Well the jealous old queen of course. Tricking the girl with the luscious looking fruit, one bite was all it took for death to deal its blow. The lovely maiden was sealed in a glass casket where all could wonder at her eternal beauty; for although days and weeks then months and years passed, the young woman remained seemingly asleep while others stooped, greyed and passed away.The queen thought she had had her cake, and eaten it too; still, she couldnt stop herself from walking past the glass casket. Weekly, then daily, then twice a day: she would stop by and slowly a terrible realisation dawned on her: death had stolen none of the young maidens beauty; the only one robbed was her, of any sense of satisfaction.Envy was like a worm burrowing silently, deep into a fruit. The worm of envy had eaten right to the core of the queen; its canker lived and flourished in her very heart. Yes, she had tricked the lovely young woman into taking the apple, had rejoiced when she bit, fell and was entombed. Her plan had worked but the beautiful girl had, nevertheless, cheated her of victorys sweet taste; for although she breathed no more, the queen had not vanquished her beauty. No, it lived on, undefeated, in her smooth unlined skin and shining hair.In her palace, the queen glanced into her beloved gilded mirror. In the past she had spied on the lovely young woman, sickened by her blossoming beauty which had surpassed her own. Now it was beloved no longer because its reflection reminded her of the maidens ultimate victory: she had cheated age and was a vision of youth eternal; while she, the worker-of-wonders, was powerless to halt the march of time across her face.Deep within her the worm twisted, tying all her initial joy into knots. When she could bear it no longer, she plotted a second time. Creeping into the maidens house, she crawled on hands and knees across the carefully swept floor, until she found the apple, still perfectly preserved in its poisoned loveliness despite its one missing bite. Hiding it in the folds of her cloak, she slipped home to the palace garden.Clearing brambles and nettles, hefting the spade herself, she dug a hole and buried the fruit- not to rid herself of the poisoned fruit, or the memory of her terrible actions- no, as she planted the fruit deep in the earth, she muttered a spell:Shovelling the soil, she imagined the young woman losing not just her life, but beautys power finally weakening before losing its hold.Every day, morning and night, rain or shine, the queen would hurry out to her garden. Standing over the soil, she would weep tears of envy, rage, but also hope: that her monstrous plan might bear fruit and succeed. And, slowly, more than the rain, more than the sun, the water from her eyes woke the apples seeds, for, like the queen, they had been waiting for the chance to work some fresh evil.When the first shoot broke the soil, she wept tears of elation. The shoot strengthened into a sapling, grew thicker, hardier, branches casting shade; and one monumental spring day the apple tree, with its ebony bark, bore blossoms as white as snow. The queen had long since dried her tears, now she smiled a thin smile to see the blossoms tremble and tumble from the boughs; in their place, apples as red as blood. Her plan was bearing fruit; time would bring the harvest.A prince from a neighbouring land rode by and was captivated by the maiden, so lovely even in death. Summoning his royal powers, he asked for the casket to be opened, which of course it duly was. With a jolt they raised they lid and the piece of apple, never swallowed, dislodged and the sleeper woke from her death-like slumber.The queen rejoiced. She herself could hardly believe it, but she rubbed her hands and threw her head back, howling with delight. Here was her chance to do the job properly; this time beauty, along with life, would surrender to her magic powers.Even news of a royal wedding in the neighbouring land could not dampen her bliss, and when a footman dressed in green velvet knocked at her door, delivering her invitation to the couples wedding, she smiled with awful pleasure.Hurriedly she penned a reply:She closed the door, picked up a basket, and went into her garden. The queen knew that revenge is a dish best served cold, even if her envy had been simmering ever since the girl had thwarted her first plan. As she plucked apple after apple from the tree, placing them carefully in her basket, she considered which dish would best deliver the revenge she had in mind; but from apple pie to crisp, no recipe seemed just right.She rested the heavy basket on her kitchen table and picked up the paring knife: splitting the fruits, gouging out cores, wresting the pips from their snug beds, cutting slice after slice, white flesh rimmed with a deep blood red.As she worked, she looked in her mirror, propped against her pots of spice: dried onion, powdered tears; and chilli: flakes to raise a fever.  She crooned to herself. Her cold eyes stared back at her and inspiration struck: a tarte tatin it would be, that most lovely of apple puddings would be her foes downfall: her just desserts.Carefully she placed the slices, arranging them in spirals before making the sauce: melting the sugar, cubing the butter, stirring until it oozed from the wooden spoon when she lifted it like threads of sticky honey. Finally, she brushed the apples, crowning the dish with its pastry hat, before popping it into the oven. Forty-five minutes to wait: after the long years of watching her rival triumph, in death as much as life, it was no time at all.When it was bronzed and the kitchen was filled with the glorious scent of home baking, the queen turned the tarte onto its crystal platter, noting with satisfaction that the apples had darkened to amber: the poison to trap her fly. The sugars had seeped out a little and she had to resist the temptation to lick her fingers as she carried the sticky confection to the door.The wedding feast was due to be celebrated the next day, but the Queen was not prepared to leave her plan a moment longer, summoning her coachman to bring her carriage immediately. Four beautiful black horses were harnessed, the carriage drew up to her door and the queen stepped lightly inside, resting her wedding gift- the lustrous dessert- on the crimson seat beside her. The coachman flicked his whip and the steeds sprang to a gallop. The queen settled herself back against the sumptuous cushions; the wheels of her plot were turning and she couldnt have been happier.From the carriage window she saw the palace come into sight. She had been expecting turrets and towers, imagining the lady would demand a home as lovely as herself. The reality was a surprise: her foes residence was more a house than a palace; it didnt dominate the land, if anything it looked small- almost ordinary. The carriage drew to a halt, the door was opened and the queen almost forgot to pick up her terrible tarte in her shock and confusion. Steadying herself at the steps, she carefully alighted and made her way to the front door, cradling the dish carefully in the snug of her arm.Before she had a chance to knock, the door was opened and the lovely young maiden- her foe- stood in the entrance, wearing an apron and a smile. The queen took two steps back in surprise but the bride seemed unphased, moving forward and taking the tarte from the visitor before it was even offered.So kind, smiled the wife-to-be, the footman gave me your reply, and how lucky that I just love apples.A pleasure, my dear, managed the queen, unsettled by the brides appearance: crumpled clothes, smudges on her cheeks from cooking, and was that a grey hair glistening in her ebony locks?The woman noticed her puzzled stare but only laughed.Oh, you must excuse my appearance: Im helping with the wedding feast, and since I woke from that long sleep, time seems to have been catching up with me a bit- busy working woman and all that!She took the queens elbow and guided her into the kitchen which was a busy chaos of platters and pots, tureens and tumblers. The bride cleared a space for the dessert and pulled two champagne flutes towards her.We must have a drink, a toast before tomorrow: we are neighbours now after all!The queen demurred: Oh no, my dear, Ive reached an age where I cant touch a drop.The bride uncorked a green bottle and a scent, strangely familiar, filled the air.Well this can be drunk entirely guilt free: water, fruit and nothing else. I promise. She said coyly. Just a little taste now, on the eve of my special day.She pressed a glass into the queens protesting hands and took one herself. And somehow the queen couldnt stop herself from raising it to her lips; like an invisible hand was lifting the glass too, and the queen was compelled to drink to the toast:The queen had to swallow the sweet drink, managing to gasp fitfully through the bubbles: but-how?How did I know about your plan? Well I took the trouble of getting a mirror of my own; you could say that I learned from experience to keep both eyes peeled for trouble.And she crossed to a mirror, gilded and oddly familiar, which reflected a kitchen the queen knew all too well, for it was her own.When I saw you making your dessert and casting your spell, I thought it might be time to pay a visit to your tree and work a little magic of my own. I hope you dont mind; there were so many apples, I didnt think youd miss a few.The queen couldnt answer as the drink was working its magic. Deep inside, the worm of envy, which had burrowed so deep- a parasite within her so long- was writhing in agony. In its death throes it lashed and squirmed until, finally, it ruled over her no longer and was gone; finally, she was free. Standing before her now was a foe no longer, simply a woman- a neighbour- with wise words to impart:But perhaps, on reflection, it might be best if we both got rid of our mirrors, staring into them too much can be a damaging past-time, at any age!The queen looked at the bride with her crumpled clothes, smudged cheeks and one grey hair, recognising her for what she was: a fellow woman and a sister to embrace.She crossed to the rubbish bin and tipped her tarte inside. Then she smiled, refilling both their glasses, and raised hers to the lovely bride.A toast to friendship: the most beautiful thing of all."
A Quiet Night,"Quiet nights like this were pretty rare in this part of town. No sirens, no parties, no loud neighbors. For once Mikes apartment was as tranquil as a Buddhist temple. He couldnt wait to fall asleep, The bed, under all its blankets looked warm, and comfy in contrast to the icy chill of his bedroom. 	But the peaceful night was interrupted with a bang. Complete terror overtook Mike. He had locked his bedroom door, and stood so quiet that the only sound he made was the uncontrollable thump of his heart beating. Somehow through the ruckus he tried to decipher what was happening in his small apartment.	From what he could hear the front door had opened, and frantic footsteps traveled toward what seemed to be his bathroom. What followed next was pained retching, dry heaving, and a toilet flushing. If this was someone coming to steal from him, they were having a rough go at it. Besides, this stranger knew exactly where Mikes bathroom was. It had to be someone he knew.	Slowly Mike creaked open the bedroom door, and called out.	Hello?	There was no reply, only the sounds of echoed retching, and heavy breathing. Unsure of what to expect. Still unsure of who was in his home Mike prepared himself for whatever would come next.	Cautiously, Mike creaked open the door to peer into the hallway. The bathroom light was on, and someone was definitely in there. At first Mike wondered if a stranger just really needed to use the bathroom, but unless he had forgotten to lock the front door it would have to be one of the three people who had a key. Mike had thought of the first person to come to mind who would be bold enough to invade his bathroom the way that they had.	Dill Pickle? And as if saying the pet name willed him into existence, there he was. Mikes Boyfriend Dylan. On his knees hovering around a toilet as if it had secret knowledge to give him.	Hey. Dylan could only muster up those words, and in a soft tone as his energy was spent on spilling his guts.	What's going on? Mike had knelt down near Dylan, and rubbed his back for comfort, but it didnt seem to do much for the sick man. He mustve just gotten off work. He was still clad in his paramedic uniform.	I think Ill need a stronger dose. Dylan spoke as if Mike knew what he was talking about, but Mike didnt know that vomiting was a normal occurrence in his lovers life.	Dose of what? Do you need me to run to Rite-aid? Mike continued rubbing Dylan's back.	No, I have to talk to my doctor again. My stomach ulcers seem like theyre getting 	worse. I used to have them when I was young, but they werent like this. Mike finally had a chance to speak after being forced to pray to the porcelain gods for the past few minutes.	You dont think work stress is causing it? Mike was finally able to look into Dylans eyes and only see shame as if he had failed himself.	Ill be fine. I just have a few more shifts this week, and Ill get my day off.	Dylan tried to assure Mike that he was okay, but Mike wasnt buying it. The mans eyes were heavy, and the fatigue that Dylan was feeling was palpable in the air.	Dill, you cant keep on going like this, theres no reason to. Mike tried his best to console Dylan, but the man nudged him away and went back to puking into the toilet. Once Dylan was finished he took a breath, and spoke as if he just ran a sprint.	I wont get better if I dont improve. And I dont want to mess up like  again. Mike had felt that the worst of his episode was over so he allowed himself to sit on the floor with his back on the wall.	Mistakes happen Dill, and that was literally your first day. Mike went to grab him a towel. The night after Dylan's first day was still fresh in his mind. It was the first time since being together that he had seen the rock in his life shed tears. But against the crashing waves of the sea all rocks can crack, and erode against its strength.	Mistakes happen? Dylan shook his head That guy died because of my mistakes. And on top of that I almost killed Mia. Mike had remembered talking to Dylans coworker Mia on more than one occasion about how self critical Dylan could be while at work, and Mike had done all he could to try and ease his mind when mistakes like that happen. But when someones life is on the line, it's hard to dismiss the value of mistakes. Every second mattered when it was someone's life was in your hands, and mistakes shortened that time.	And whens the last time you took a risk like that when youre driving? Dylan was quiet for a moment before looking back at Mike, and shaking his head. Thats right, you dont do that shit anymore. And in a funny way because that guy died, he ended up saving just as many people as you have.	Dylan just shook his head. But how long will it be before my Ulcers makes me fuck up? If they find out how bad it gets, theyll think Im too weak to work, and they mi- and like a surge of inspiration Dylan went from sitting to back on his knees, over the toilet, dry heaving, and in pain.	You need water Dill! Mike darted quickly into the kitchen and came back with a cup of water. Mike set it beside Dylan while he finished leaning on the toilet bowl, and took a sip afterward.	Ill be better after this week I swear. Dylan tried to reassure him, but Mike only	shook his head.	Youll never be content this way Theres nothing you can do about it now except learn from it. Dylans vomiting had finally subsided enough to where he could think about what Mike was saying to him. He took a sip of the water Mike had brought, and spoke.	People need me. And I just cant let them down.	And I need you too, but for different reasons. I just want you to be okay, and get home safe and healthy. You arent weak or less of a man because you need the day off sometimes. Your body is telling you to take it easy, and youre ignoring it. The two were silent for a while, partially to wait out and see if Dylans stomach had anything else left to say, and partially for Dylan to contemplate his lovers words. Finally Dylan spoke.	Sorry for barging in and ruining your night Mikey Dylans eyes held dark circles over them. But Mike just scoffed at his apology.	One of the best people in my life came over, had a deep chat with me, andll cuddle me tonight. Im actually kinda happy you got sick.	The two men chuckled and a wave of ease fell over the both of them. Dylan was still a bit weak, but luckily Mike had some medicine hidden away that would settle his stomach down for the night, and after a while the night found its peace once more, and Dylan with Mikes help was ushered to bed with a bucket in his free hand just in case."
Insanely Fine Cuisine,"Warning: a bit of gore and violenceDuncan Dupree, head chef of La Vie Le Calamar, drummed his fat fingers on his crossed upper arms and surveyed the chefs in training as they prepared Le Grande Repas Quatro, the feast for that evening.His snooty nose in the air, his little piggy eyes lasered onto Pierre as the young man added a dollop of truffle oil to his risotto.Dupree waddled over to the gently bubbling pot and inhaled the steam, dramatically closing his eyes and wafting the steam towards him with one hand, the other hand at the end of a limp wrist.I thought, . The cool young man ignored the fat chef and even had the audacity to smile.His smile was beautific too, like Mona Lisa watching the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld.How I admired him.He was tall, my height, with dark cropped GQ hair and blue eyes so dark, they made sapphires jealous.He was thin, with broad shoulders, and favored the slim-fitting mens fashions of Italy- snug, muscle-hugging, yet soft and sleek and sometimes shiny.I, on the other hand, come from old Scottish farming stock, red of hair, freckled of face, and somewhat thick boned.I was not jealous of Pierre, and dont get me wrong, I was not in love with him either, but instead, I used him as inspiration to get back to the gym.Dupree on the other hand, either was extremely jealous of him or madly infatuated.Or perhaps hed been bullied as a child, and now took out his revenge upon us students.This was a very expensive culinary academy.They taught only four students at a time.The owner of the academy was the multi-billionaire foodie, Malcome Crackett the Third, who also owned the magazine Trip and Tip that I wrote articles for.The writing was my first professional gig; I aspired to write novels, but did enjoy the travel and tasting and reviewing, my name was getting out there.At last, next month, I was scheduled for my first European series of reviews.I was at La Vie Le Calamar onI suppose you could say, a scholarship, Crackett liked my work so far and had injected my name into the roster for this semester.We were into the final week (five days, actually) and I, along with three other students, Dupree, and a guest- sometimes a movie star, sometimes a political star, sometimes Crackett himself- feasted on each of the five nights on meals we created in the immense modern steel kitchen of the academy.Each morning of the final five days, Dupree handed out the assignments; each of the five days, us five- students and head chef- were tasked with one of the five categories: Entre, starch side, vegetable side, soup, or salad. Salad did desert as well.Each of us made one of these in accordance with whomever was tasked with the entre.When the meal was eaten, the cameras stopped rolling.Dupree was the quintessential jilted one from a Gerry Springer, the crier of a black mother whose murderous, drug dealing gangster son was killed by cops. He was drama personified.The preparing was all filmed for the hit foodie tv show on HBO of the same name as the academy, Duprees bullying was essential for the shows success, he was the man you loved to hate.He threw things.He ranted and raved.He bulliedand the audience ate it up (pun intended.)As I watched from the corner of my eye, Pierre nodded slightly.He was bracing himself.The other two students in the kitchen, Vera, the only woman in our class, and Charlie, the burly, bearded Canadian, tried not to quiver, but did anyways, fearful of Duncans rants and raves.Not to disappoint the audience, Dupree, after inhaling the steam I caught whiffs of from across the steel prep table in the center, dramatically flailed his fat white hands in the air and bellowed, Wrong! All wrong!Where is the !Where is the earthy scent dat de connoisseurs want?!Gah!Start over!He grabbed a wooden spoon in the rest on my side of the table and threw it at Pierre.Then he dumped the risotto, pot and all, into the trash bin.My mouth had watered as the risotto steam met my nose.It had been perfect.Pierre smiled that smile, and silently bowed towards the fat man who turned his back on him with a Harumph and acted as though Pierre were kowtowing, but I knew different.I saw the young mans eyes.They flashed red, like a warning.He grinned and his canines grew as I watched, saliva strung thinly down his chin.He lunged at the fat man and sunk his teeth into the fat roll of his neck.Wet red blood spewed like a geyser!I gasped, ducked, and covered my face before the shower flooded over me.Dupree said, Michael Magilicutty!Cest quoi ce bordel!You got de bee in ya noggin boy?Mind that souffl or it will fall.I looked up.No blood, no fangs.I realized that I did have a bee in my noggin.I stifled an insane titter.Dupree then set his sights on Vera, a petite Vietnamese woman with deer-in-headlights eyes behind thick glasses.She was assigned lamb for the entre that night and had chosen a braised recipe with Morroccan spices.Vera cringed under the bully-chefs piggy gaze, and I lost respect for her.Dupree inspected the rack and tasted the marinade.He slammed his hand onto the table WHAM! and Poor Vera jumped, as did I and the Canadian that looked like a lumberjack.Only Pierre kept his calm as he prepared a new pot of boiling chicken stock.This is fine, Dupree said with a hint of meh, Needs some zing some pow.He slammed the table again.I dared a peek into my oven.I swear that ass was trying to collapse my artichoke souffle.I felt those nasty little eyes on my back and chided myself for letting him get to me.I busied myself with my lemon aioli sauce.Behind me Charlie, the Canuck, sighed audibly as Dupree passed him by.That night, Jennifer Judson was our guest star, there to promote her new talk show.Naturally, Dupree bent over backwards to kiss her black ass; Vera and Charlie were star struck, Pierre was visibly amused by her advances towards him off camera, and I was glad to see the egocentric twat flustered though Dupree would make Pierre pay.She sat at one end of the table, Dupree, at the other.Vera sat across from me next to Pierre.Dupree acted the proud momma hen, Charlie was his funny self, Judson talked about herself and her show.The meal was delicious, though the risotto was too earthy, and damn that Dupree if he didnt belittle Pierres culinary talents.I warned you the truffle oil was potent. Dupree waggled a finger at Pierre.Pierre said, Ah.Arent certain breeds of ovine the truffle experts?He didnt look up from his forkful.Judson laughed like a braying mule.The rest of us looked stunned as Duprees entire head turned into a tomato.He recovered quickly and said, Oui. Why yes, in the Basque territory of France, leetle piglets of the rare Gascon family are trained to sniff the delicacies out.As a leetle boy I often accompanied mon pere with our prize piggiesPierre, who actually did come from France, put down his fork and said, But Chef Dupree, is it not fact you grew up in the Bronx?Dupree stood, sprightly for such a large man, plucked the carving knife from the table and hurled it at Pierre like a spangled professional at the circus.Pierre caught the knife by the blade, leapt upon the table like a cat, crouched, then sprung at Dupree.Blood from his hand rained down, turning the white tablecloth into a gory rorschach test as he charged.Both women screamed, Vera fainted, Charlie turned, and discreetly vomited under the table.Dupree quivered with fright and fury, his fists balled as if he was going to punch the feral young man.Pierre plunged the knife into the top of the mans head to its hilt.Dupree feebly punched left and right like a windup toy monkey winding down.Blood teared from his eyes, spurted from his nose, and gushed from his open mouth as he gargled a scream.Micheal.I spun to the left to see who had spoken, but to my left, Judson stared at me curiously.I looked back to Dupree and realized I had stood up.He was not bloody.He had that smarmy look on his face.Pierre was just digging into his creamy Rhubarb Vanilla mousse.I sat and Dupree made a circular motion by his left ear.Buzzing bees in dere.I sat down and faked a laugh.I thought to myself, I zoned back to the dinner party, but my mind was on the issue that had sent my wife packing a month ago.ook?Charlie had been talking to me.I looked up.He had green lumpy vomit, like pea soup, down his front.When I blinked it was gone.Im sorry.What were you asking?Wonderin how your book is coming.Its nearly done, eh?Heh heh.Well, its been on hold the last couple of weeks.I gestured at the table, now devoid of the meal but displaying near empty desert dishes.The next day in the kitchen, on the air, Pierre, tasked with venison for the entre, announced it would be Bourguignon.Dupree smiled smugly.No one made Bourguignon as good as heand venison?Unheard of.I was tasked with the soup and felt a light bisque of some sort would be an ideal starter for the rich, sauce-laden entre.Tomato-carrot with a drizzle of parsley pesto.I heard Janices naggy voice in my head as I chopped my carrots with a deadly looking blade. naggingsaneThe voice was chill, calm, patronizing.I wondered for a minute if she was right. The lie felt even worse in my head that it had out loud. I was lying to myself now..That sounded better maybe.Dupree was on the warpath.We all could feel it in the air.It was his last chance to humiliate Pierre once and for all.He wanted a meltdown.He wanted a resignation. I suspect he wanted, above all, a blowjob.Though his exterior was calm, the air buzzed with his nefarious intentions. Then I realized that it was my head that was buzzing.Those damned bees. I looked around.No one was watching me.I poured a half cup of cooking sherry into my water bottle, looked around again, and drank it down. The buzzing subsided.Dupree was complimenting Vera on her choice of bitter endives for her salad, the bleu cheese crumbles and small dabs of bright red sundried tomato chutney was perfect.I looked over and saw that the chutney was oozing over the table and plopping to the floor like bloody gore.I blinked.It was gone.Vera was mixing the batter for her crepes suzette.Shed won back some of my respect, the Grand Marnier would double as an aperitif and her extra egg whites guaranteed a lighter crepe. She would make a fine chef one day.I wasnt so sure about Charlie. I just couldnt get the lumberjack image out of my head.I looked over at him and saw he was chopping his broccoli with a wooden handled axe. Whump! Whump! Whump! As Charlie scooped up the bite-sized florets, I saw a scattering of severed fingers on the table, their bloody stumps glistening redDupree came over, surely to take the axe away and laugh at the funny joke.The fat man blocked my view as he patted Charlie on one of his beefy, flannelled shoulders.Very gute Charlie.Very creative to infuse a hint of Asia into a French meal.Bite sized, I like that, we cut the meat, we dont need to cut the veggies too, no? Charlie was whisking together a miso-based marinade, his black mushrooms sitting by in a julienned pile.I drank some coffee quickly as Dupree turned my way, swirling the fumey beverage in my mouth. Ah, Michael.Very good choice for zee soup.Light, cleansing ze palate.Ah, and ze parlsey too, an obvious palate cleanser, not so subtle.I wished he would STOP with the fake accent.It made my head start to buzz again.Should I have used basil?Tut tut dear boy, non. A chef goes with what he feels is right, his instinct. I would have chosen parsley as well.Dupree was being nice.Scary.I feared for PierreWho was humming as he sprinkled a pinch of fresh herbs into the aromatic dish Julia Child had made famous.I was concerned. Dupree had given Pierre venison instead of beef because if not cooked just exactly right, it would be tough and, or, too gamey, stringy.But the handsome Pierre was humming as if he were Peter Pan and had a pixie at his shoulder to magically make everything he made the most spectacular.And it was.Dinner that night was the best of our five.The entre was spectacular.I had only eaten venison in sausage form and knew it to be gamey.But, like a good scotch, one embraces the character of the drink, whether oaky or smokey, in venison, a subtle hint of gamey is key.Pierre perfected the dish.It melted in the mouth but wasnt mushy.The texture resembled rare filet mignon.Seasoned perfectly, and wonderfully black peppery, his entre was unique and sure to be a hit at whatever restaurant he opened in the future.I was proud of him.I swelled with joy.He nonchalantly accepted the praise of our guest, Mr.Crackett himself, with his glass of cabernet raised.He was radiant. His pale skin glowed, his sapphire eyes sparkled as he looked directly at me and licked his lower lip.My head was buzzing again.  And I congratulated myself for knowing better. .We all looked to Dupree.His opinion mattered little. The viewers voted, the guests comments aided the viewers decisions.How would the fat man deal with this young nemesis moving on to greatness?Dupree, smiling and smarmy, cloyingly polite, apologized to the table and the cameras, as he got up and said, Im afraid zere iz something wrong with ze meat.I fear I am going to, uh, be ill.He dramatically left the room, limp-wristed hand on his up-raised brow, the other on his chest.! I thought.Getting sick on major tv was the absolute worst, the paramount disgrace no aspiring chef could survive. Everyone was talking at the table, but their voices were buzzing in and out.I held my head together with my hands, unsure of what was real, and what was my illness.When I looked up at the table, everyone sitting around it was grinning. Apparently, Id imagined the whole thing beforeincluding the eating, the entre in the center was still sitting under a silver dome.I looked around and sighed with relief, no buzzing.Everyone looked normal.No blood spurting from knife wounds, no bloody gore dripping to the floor.The sides were passed around, I took the bowl of miso dressed broccoli from Charlie on my right and turned to pass it to the fat asshole on my left.His seat was empty. I placed the bowl on the table and looked surreptitiously at each person sitting at the table.They were chatting and talking with their hands and smiling.I caught Pierres eye from across the table.He winked at me and grinned.His canines were two inches long.When the tongue that flicked out licked up his entire forehead and around to his chin, I shut my eyes and chanted, He lifted the silver dome and, , there was Duncan Duprees fat piggy head, roasted, perfectly charred on all the right edges, a sweet Honeycrisp apple in a mouth that was stretched far too wide.The edges of it were split like the Jokers, and marrow-like goo drooled down the fat, roasted chin.Real or imaginary, I cared not at this point. I ran screaming from the room, not caring what they thought or what the cameras caught.I ran home.It was six miles.I did not trust myself to drive. At my condo, I swallowed three of the pills and crawled underneath my bed with my cell phone.I googled psychiatrists.I texted my ex."
Are You All  Over the Meadow?,"Teddy was out of sorts. This afternoons visit with his cousins was not living up to expectations. Ruby, at six, was a year older and bossy. He no longer liked her silly game. Ruby had made it up and insisted they play it all afternoon. It seemed to Teddy to consist of nothing more than running about and never getting anywhere. He stood at the top of the lawn, which sloped in a smooth sweep of spongy turf to the road below, making angry dents in the soil with his toe. Ruby was calling out the signature line again.Are you all over the meadow?Yes. He responded with little enthusiasm.Can I come with you? Teddy roared his frustration.That was the signal to run, and Teddy and Ruby raced away on diagonals across the sloping lawn, passing each other in the middle and looping around to the top where Ethel sat, her hands clamped over her eyes. Ethels three-year-old legs had had enough, and she had decided to become invisible. It wasnt working, though, because Teddy marched straight up to her and pulled her hands away. You were sposed to run with us.I not, declared Ethel.. Thats the rules.I  Ethels voice rose in defiance. Teddy scowled. His head bent suddenly over her hand, still held in his. Poor Ethel squealed in horror, her face crimson; he had her. She held the injured wrist up to show Ruby, who plopped down on the grass beside her and peered earnestly into her face, full of big sister concern. Whatever has happened Effie?Deddy bid me Ethel huffed through her tears. Look Ruby, look. marks. Ruby looked. She glared at her cousin who stood with his arms folded firmly across his chest, pouting and unrepentant.Teddy, did you bite Ethel you?So what if I did, said Teddy, she was cheating, so there.Shes only three, Teddy. She doesnt understand the rules. Youre very naughty to bite.Dont care. Youre not my mummy anyway. Youre a big ninny.Incensed, Ruby did something that she was to regret, oh so much, afterwards. See how  like it. She grabbed Teddys hand and raised it to her mouth. Before he could react she had closed her teeth, leaving bite marks on skin for the second time that day. Teddy roared in anger.Im going to tell Mummy on you. vewynaughty, Wuby. You will be in big twouble now. His face burned and angry tears glazed his eyelashes to points. Teddy always lost his rs when he got upset. He stumped off in righteous fury to find his mother.Why did Teddy bite you, Ethel? said Henry, Teddys older brother. Henry was nearly ten and considered himself far too mature to join in the younger childrens game. He had spent the last hour sitting on the grass with a book in his hands. A thoughtful boy, he had quietly observed Teddys rising anger.Ethel was starting to enjoy the attention. din do anyfing, Henry. She cradled the sore hand against her tummy, unselfconsciously using her baby voice to good effect. He jus did it, jus like dat. She emphasised the point with a chopping motion of her good arm.Ruby rose and offered a hand. Come on Effie, Daddy will be home soon. Lets go down to the gate and wait there. I bet I see him first.No will. Tears forgotten, she bustled across the lawn with Ruby. Henry followed the girls, and it was Henry who saw his Uncle Walter first, striding down Arney Crescent with his jacket over his shoulder. Walters law practice was handily situated in the nearby village of Remuera, and he loved walking home on a fine summer evening like this, down the hill past the many fine houses with the sea in his face. It gave him time to put aside the problems of the day and prepare to indulge in that most rewarding of pastimes, playing with his children. Now he swung Ethel onto his shoulders and took Rubys hand, listening gravely as she explained in detail the rules and objectives of her new game.As soon as she learnt to walk, Ruby would potter about the garden with Walter on the weekends, as he patiently explained what he was doing and why. 'See this little leaf here, you have to break it off very carefully, so the plant channels its energy into growing tomatoes instead of growing more stems and leaves. Yes you can try. Gently, Ruby, gently! Oh, see you've broken the whole stem now. Never mind, next time you'll get it right.' They would spend whole afternoons walking down to the wharf and fishing with a handline for sprats, walking back as the light faded and the sky blushed green and gold.But now, only half an hour later, Ruby hung her head and stared at the patterned red carpet in the big front room, twisting her hands in front of her. She bit her lip and tried to keep back the tears. Walters ice-blue eyes, which normally radiated laughter, were troubled. Your aunt is very upset. Teddy says you bit him, Ruby, is this true?Ruby didnt look up. Daddy was so cross! She couldnt remember ever seeing that look on his face, and she was devastated. Yes, Daddy, she whispered.I am extremely disappointed in you, Ruby. I should have thought you would be more responsible. You will need to be punished for this. Walter was a gentle man. He had never yet punished one of his children, but his sisters boy had a valid grievance, and she expected to see justice done. They had been brought up in an era when children were seen and not heard, when spare the rod and spoil the child was considered sound parenting advice. Walter desperately wanted to be a good father and bring up responsible, considerate, and law-abiding children. His own parenting style was more aboutmentoring than reward and punishment, and he knew his sister believed he was over-indulgent. His decision was strongly biased by that knowledge. I shall have to spank you, and then you must go to your room. You will have no dinner tonight.Ruby lay in her bed upstairs and cried for a long time. She had never been spanked before and she felt the shame deeply. She had wanted to expose Teddys behaviour to excuse her own but somehow the words she needed wouldnt come. She craved her Daddys approval and she feared there was nothing she could say that would absolve her. So she endured the spanking and cried into her pillow.Rubys mother had planned a special meal but dinner at the big round table was unusually quiet. Teddy, fully aware of his guilt, was disconcerted by the severity of the sentence passed on Ruby. Henrywas contemplating injustice and whether he ought to speak up, while Walters mind was haunted by Rubys woebegone face. In the absence of her sister and in the strained atmosphere, Ethel was uncharacteristically subdued. Henry finally took advantage of yet another long silence.Uncle Walter?Yes Henry?Actually, he said. Henry had recently discovered this word and used it whenever possible. Teddy bit Ethel first. And thats why Ruby bit .Is that so? Thank you for telling me that, Henry. Did you bite Ethel, Teddy?Teddy, red faced, concentrated desperately on his plate. Yes.Walter regarded Teddy for a moment, his face expressionless. In that case, maybe the wrong child has been punished. I must visit the prisoner.Ruby lifted a tear-stained face when Walter knocked.May I come in? He looked around the door.Yes, Daddy. Her voice was hoarse from crying.Im told that Teddy bit Ethel, he said, sitting amiably on the bed. Is thatwhat happened?Yes Daddy. He was so mean about it and I was so cross with him Her lip wobbled.Oh sweetheart, he gathered her into his arms. That was wrong, you know that dont you? Two wrongs dont make a right. She nodded her head against his shirt front. But there is such a thing as a mitigating circumstance, and I shouldnt have punished you so harshly without asking more questions. Im very, very sorry. Ok? More vigorous nodding. I am going to make a promise to you, Ruby. I promise I will never spank you again.And do you know what? He never did."
A Night Of Waking Dreams,"I can see it now, She says nervously. Her big blue eyes stare over you, out the window. I can see the rain now. It wasnt raining before, was it?You pretend to be asleep. Rise and fall. Rise and fall. You force yourself to take big, deep breaths, breaths like the ones Aria takes, the times shes fallen asleep faster than you. You let out a little sigh, a sleeping sigh, and pray it wasnt too dramatic.Aria is sitting up. She had been asleepthen the storm started. Probably woke up to the sound of the sky cracking in half and booming as it broke.Not literally, of course. But by the thundering growls outside, it sure sounded like it.Iris? Arias small hand taps your shoulder, Iris? Are you asleep?You choose not to answer.Your eyes are closed, but you can still feel her eyes on you, in the way most sisters can. Shes watching for a twitch of the eye, a flick of the wrist, a jerk of the leg.And you wont give it to her.The thunder roars, past the yellow flowered curtains, lighting filling up the night sky like flying electric eels. Squinting your eyes the littlest bit, you see shadows dancing and twirling and waltzing on the bedroom wall. The room, and the world outside the window, looks eery and dark. The clouds cover the moon, but sometimes they shift to let its light through.The soft glowing white rays illuminate the walls and the objects in the messy bedroom, filling places that shouldnt be filled with a sheet of ghostly white. The storm and the night work together to play tricks on your eyes, on your mind. You see a shape flick past you, to your right. Or maybe you dont. you hear a howling in the distance. Or maybe you dont. a hill to the west, not visible through the small window, but there nonetheless, would make a perfect place for howling at the moon. A perfect place for dangerous night things. A perfect place for fear.But youre thirteen years old. Storms dont scare you. Youve studied them in school, studied their patterns and formations. And youve lived on this farm all your life, lived near the hill to the west, and you have never seen a dangerous night thing.Yet.A small hum comes from your side, light and high and worried. A siren. Or a little girl.You remember Aria next to you. In truth, you never forgot. You feel her weight shift, as she lays back down, seemingly giving up on the thought of waking you.Not that she could. You like to consider yourself the best fake-sleeper there is. Seven years of sharing a bed with Aria does that to you.You wait until you hear her breathing slow, hear her whimpers resolve. You turn slowly on your side, facing her, silently hoping shes really asleep. Or even in that land between sleep and waking, that land filled with tunnels of light and explosions of dreaming particles. You like that feeling, that feeling of being half-asleep, half-awake. You like feeling like time has frozen in place. You feel safe there, in that land, so close and yet so far away.You hope Aria feels safe, there, too.Her little body is curled in on itself, frilled, clumped. She holds a small bundlea bundle of rags. A bundle called Rugs. A bundle called love.Her young, plump fingers squeeze the tighter and tighter and tighter. Unflinching. Clenching. Because it seems shes still awake. It seems she hears the thunder. Though her eyes are closed, she must see the bright flashes of lightning behind her lids.Thats alright. You used to worry that you subconsciously liked Aria best when she was sleeping. A strange worry, that was. Youve had a lot of strange worries.But you know now, for sure, that even though you like sleeping Aria, you like awake Aria better. Normally. But maybe not now. Not an hour past midnight.She looks so peaceful, even if shes only faking sleep.And then, the thunder cries louder than it has before. The ground seems to rumble the ceiling fan swings ever so slightly, casting a dancing shadowa large bird flying in the dim light.Arias eyes fly open. Her death grip on Rugs loosens and she reaches her small arm to you. She needs you.Iris, her little voicethe voice of a bumblebee, mother sayscalls to you.The storm, she whinnies, a pony with pigtails, Rugs is scared.Rugs is scared. Of course rugs is scared. Rugs is a bundle of rags. If you were a bundle of rags, you'd be scared, too.Fine. Fine, she wants you awake. You had both been faking each other, in truth. And you both knew it, too. You werent asleep, and neither was she.What, Ari? your voice comes out more crackly than you thought it would, What can I do to help Rugs feel better?A roaring thunderous boom.Aria sits bolt upright. Her hair is sticking up at all angles, and you would laugh, if she didnt look so terrified.Rugs wants a story. Can you tell him a story, Iris? she says.Ari, its late. Later than late. Im not sure if a storys a good idea.Pleasssse, she stretches out the word so long it sounds more like a moan.Oh, alright. One story. And then will Rugs stop pestering me and go to sleep?She bobs her head full of straw-colored hair. Up and down. Up and down.Once upon a time, you start, there lived two sisters. One of them, the older one, was calledumIsabel. and the younger one was namedAddy. And they were pirates. They lived on a boat called the Dangerous Night Thing, but they called it the DNT for short. Yeah. The DNT. Anyway, the two sisters werePrincesses?Excuse me?They were princesses, right? Werent they princesses, Iris?Uhwell, I told you they were pirates. Thats their thing.They can have two things, though. Cant they be pirate princesses?Pirateoh, fine. Let me keep going, though. These two pirate princesses sailed the seven seas with the DNT, and they fought sea monsters for a living. Not because they liked too, really, but because fighting sea monsters was a stable job with a good hourly pay. And this one night, they were fighting a big sea monster with tentacles. It was like a giant octopus, if a giant octopus was neon orange. And it had one eye. One big, glaring, blinking eye. And it could swallow a whole fishing boat with one gulp, a bit like how you ate your potato salad yesterday. But it couldnt eat the DNT, because the DNT was as big as it was. It would be like you, trying to eat a motorcycle. If you were the size of a motorcycle. But yeah. IsabellaIsabel, Iris. Her name was Isabel.You give Aria the stink eye. No, you say, Im telling the story and I say her name was Isabel. But she went by Isabella, sometimes, too.She shrugs. Keep going.Thats all there is to it. They were fighting a sea monster. In the DNT. And they were winning. The end.Thats not a very good story.I know.Then make it better.You cross your arms. How?Act it out. Arias little bottom lips pouts out. She seems to have forgotten about the storm outside. Good. Youll keep it that way.Alright. Lets say the bed is the boat. See that chair? Thats a lifeboat. And the ceiling fan in a seagull.The thunder clapped outside. Aria leaned closer to you.Rugs doesnt like the thunder, Iris, she says softly.Well, tell Rugs thats not thunder. Thats just the sea monster roaring as we so bravely vanquish it.Arias frown twists and flips until it runs into a grin.I can tell him that. So were fighting itthe sea monsterright now?Yup. Were winning, too.And, looking out into the bedroom, you let yourself imagine. You havent, in a long time, but you do now. The carpet dissolves into a black ocean. Your guitar in the corner tangles into a school of piranhas. There have to be piranhas. Obviously. Arias soccer ball becomes the DNTs anchor, slowly sinking so that you can keep fighting the monster.Oh, the monster. It roars and growls and hisses. It gets louder every few seconds, then dies down as you stab at it with your swords. Side by side, you and Aria take on a beast.But the roaring gets louder. Louder than any living thing could get. And the carpet turns to carpet again, and the guitar and soccer ball become just that. And you and Aria find yourselves squatting on the bed together, facing a monster that never existed.A powerful crash of thunder.Iris? Arias bumblebee voice squeaks, I dont want to be on the boat anymore. Rugs is scared. Tell me another story.And you do. Because you want to feel that feeling againthat feeling you get when you imagine, and everything dissolves into something better. You want to feel alive.This time, the story starts in a jungle.Not just a jungle, a jungle cave. Two super smart and brave scientist ladies are there together, studying the rare one-footed dart frog. The frog lives on trees but will squirt poison at your through its eyes if it sees you. So thats why theyre hiding in the cave. And in this jungle, it never rains or thunders. Ever. Never ever.But Iris, Aria interrupts, How are there trees if it never rains?So smart, that one.Well, You say quickly, The trees get their water from an underground river. Like a aquifer.Take that big word, Aria. Youre smart, too. Aquifer. Ha.Wheres the cave for us? she asks.Under the bed, of course. Ready to go?And together you crawl under the bed. Its warm and stuffy, and its cramped (because you seem to have grown since the last time you were there), but a jungle cave is warm and stuffy and cramped, too.That pile of clothes? Thats a rare berry bush. Called the shadow berry. The lamp it the tree were watching. And that stain on the lamp, from when I spilled my chocolate milk, is the one-footed frog. It looks asleep, but its only faking.Aria stares at the frog with an intensiveness you match. You can hear the tropical birds calling to each other from high above.And then you hear a scratching sound. Like a fingernail against a blackboard. But its not, obviously. No, its the big oak outside the window dragging its branch across the glass..It might be the spookiest sound youve heard all night.Aria shivers beside you. Shes not looking at the stain or the lamp or the pile of dirty clothes anymore. Shes looking out the window, at the dark silhouette of the branch, like a witchs hand, dragging on the sill.And before you can stop her, Arias squirming out from under the bed, Rugs in hand. In a flash she jumps under the covers and pulls the quilt over her eyes. You hear her ragged breathing coming fast from beneath the fabric.It takes you longer than it took her, but you join her on the bed.Aria? you ask quietly.I dont want to be in the cave anymore, she says, Rugs is scared. Tell a different story?Its late. And youre starting to feel tired. The adrenaline from studying the poison-shooting jungle frog is wearing thin.I think we need to get some sleep. Rugs, too.This affects her instantly.I caaant! she whines. If Rugs talked, he would be whining, too.You rub you temples. But you have an idea.Fine. One more story. Once upon a time, there was a little girl. This little girl wasnt a pirate, or a princess, or a scientist. She didnt live on a boat, or in a jungle cave. She lived in a little house on a farm with a hill to the west. And she was sitting on a bed with a blue quilt. And she was holding a ball of kitchen rags wadded together. She called it Bugs.Arias eyes narrowed. This girl sounds a lot like me. And Bugs sound a lot like Rugs. I dont know what youre doing, Iris, but whatever it is, stop it.You go on.And its storming outside. But heres the thing: this little girl and her bundle of ragsBugsloved storms. And so she walked up to the window and looked out. And she saw God. Well, maybe not God, but she saw something that looked a lot like God. She saw little drops of silver, falling from the sky in the smallest drops. Where had those drops been before? She saw a flash of bright light, like a ray of sunshine, only faster, quicker, smarter, filling the night sky with a powerful blanket of a thousand stars. She saw the fingers of a motherly oak, stroking the windows in a caress. And she heard the most spectacular sound. Like a billion moments of laughter, all bundled up together. Like a collectiona chorus! Of miraculously hilarious instances, let out in a few seconds of built up noise. It was awesome. And the little girl just sat there, for the rest of the thunderstorm, with Bugs by her side, and she watched and listened. And she felt so small. But that felt good. Because there was so much out thereso much awesomeness. And the storm reminded her of that. And then, after she got really tired, she went to sleep. And because she was asleep, her big sister felt safe and secure. And her big sister kissed the little girls cheek, and kissed Bugswellkissed on of Bugs rags, and went to sleep, too. The end.You cleared your throat. And sat in a moment of silence. Was Aria asleep?You turned to face her. No. no, she was awake. She wasnt looking at you, though. And she wasnt looking at the bed-boat, or the lamp-tree. She was looking out the window, at the rain. The lighting. The oak branch rubbing the window. And the thunder boomed loud and powerful and good, and she didnt hide. She didnt curl closer to you. She just held Rugs a little tighter, and kept watching.And she didnt say a word. She just sat there. And you sat there. But oh, were you tired. Slowly, ever so slowly, you laid down. You closed you eyes. You fell asleep.Later, you awokebut not really. You were half-awake, and half-asleep. Maybe your eyes opened, and maybe they didnt, but the next morning, you could have sworn you had seen Aria, still watching the window, a small smile playing on her lips.Hours passed, and then you woke up for real. It was still dark outside. The storm was over. Water droplets were racing each other down the window pane, and the oaks branch wasnt waving in the wind anymore.Aria was next to you, fast asleep.You leaned over and kissed her forehead. And then you kissed Rugswellrag. And you laid down next to your little sister, and let yourself drift off into a world of your on creation. You dreamt of pirate princesses and neon orange sea monsters. Of explorers and poisonous fake-sleeping frogs. And you dreamt of new things, wonderfully crazy things, until morning came."
That Damn Remote,"Months ago, my wife and I had a heated argument over the most ridiculous thing in the world. Our remote for our television disappeared, as they tend to do, which started a domino of exhausted complaints and snarls on both our parts. We checked the recliner cushions, under the sofa, we even checked the damn cat bed at one point. After at least 30 minutes of sprawling around like wild animals, nearly tearing the place up like it too, I sat down and bared our loss. Lets just give it a rest and return to this later. Im sure itll show up I suggested.	My bitter wife expressed the most sour disappointing look Ive ever seen. A look an old fashion father would give after learning his son was gay while subsequently sucking a juicy lemon. Way to give up, Gerard! Thats a new one.	I returned with a sour face of my own, Whats that supposed to mean?	You know what it means! You always do this and its why nothing ever gets done. Id bet you the freaking house well end up just buying a new remote knowing you!	Youre overreacting again. For Christ's sake its just a remote, Kim. Itll turn up soon enough and well both look stupid for making such a big deal about it.	Kim threw her hands up in disgust before resting them firmly on her hips as if getting comfortable for one of her rants. Look, Ill admit, the remote is a stupid thing. But this isnt just about the remote at this point. Gerard, this last month you have failed to get the car cleaned, to buy Stavros birthday gift and even small things like taking out the trash or feeding the cat. Im getting pissed that youve being so lazy lately	I sighed, knowing that was just a small part of her complaints. First of all, Ive been working overtime this week, second of all the car is nearly spotless and third of all, youre just as lazy as me half the time. Those girls nights of yours last hours upon end and all you do is talk about stupid, mind-numbing stuff like work gossip and rom coms. I mean you guys sound like you came right out of desperate housewives in there. Meanwhile our kids rely on me and me alone to see them put to sleep while they wonder why mommy isnt there to tell them a story or even kiss them goodnight	You volunteered for that responsibility, thank you very much! she yipped like a dog far too loud for how small it was, When we got married we agreed to our responsibilities, Im not good with kids and you know that, so you take care of teaching them and all that while I take care of keeping them busy and entertained. Im grateful that you got that part of your job down, but tell me, why cant you feed the animal and take the trash out when you can?!	At that point our argument had derailed in directions they hadnt in months if not years. I hate doing that with her but she always made it so difficult to reason. Maybe you should consider trying. Every think of that? Kids arent exactly a walk in the park to deal with but once you put the effort in you can at least know how to talk to them like a parent should. This is a team effort so why do we have to separate ourselves like this?	Oh so now you're making this about me being a bad parent? Kims voice peaks with genuine shock, This is about you being sloppy and lazy over simple little things! I do my part so why cant you do yours? I hate having to argue like this as much as you do, but if I dont youll just keep this shit up. Heck, I wouldnt be surprised if this kept happening for months to come knowing you.	Taken aback by such a spontaneous situation I sit myself down on our couch. I rest my face into my palms and take a deep, necessary breath. I dont know what your problem is, Kim. But Im not in the mood to argue any more. Can we please just end this and move on with our night. Ill sleep on the fucking couch if you want just please. I hope the kids didnt hear us	I hope the kids did! she shouted, They need to know how much of a lazy piece of shit their father is. Maybe then theyll start talking some sense into you too	Just like how they need to know their mother is too much of a coward to love them like she should?! Lets sleep this off, Kim. We can talk about this tomorrow. And not yell. Talk	Kim began making her way towards the stairs, dimly lit by a nightlight in the corner. Her eyes looked as tired as I felt. I knew she hated to argue as much as I did, which still confuses me as to why she starts these things in the first place. I looked away while I could to make our departure less awkward. I found myself a cozy blanket to shelter myself under for the night and fell into an unsettling slumber accompanied by a dream of our life before the kids. Before getting married. Just two young idiots roaming the country for a nice simple life to share. I imagined how happy we were. How comforting and fulfilled we felt when we embraced. A fairly distant memory I find myself missing more often than I feel I should. 	The morning finally came after my near endless depressing void of a dream. I quickly folded the blanket and put it back where it belonged so as to not tempt any questions from our very observant boys. The day went by silently and almost agonizing as it was both a weekend and one of my days off. My wife and I didnt share a single word throughout the day. We hardly even saw each other. Halfway through it, I noticed the kitchen trash can was overfilling. I thought back on Kims words from the night prior and almost ignored it out of spite. But I decided to do the hygenic thing and deal with it before it became a bigger problem. A part of me felt great for doing something productive, however a different side of me felt guilt for doing it after our confrontation. It was almost as if I only did it because of the corner I was backed into. I felt humiliated and disheartened. Even so, I continued to do small things around the house such as sweeping the bathroom floors and wiping down the living room coffee table. I hardly felt any better after each courtesy.	Trying to keep a level head about it, I made my way through the upstairs hall where our bedrooms are to check on our boys. Each passing room waited emptily as I creeped through. That was until I reached the room at the very end, Stavros room. I peaked in, slowly and cautiously after hearing soft words and giggles. Kim was sitting on Stravros bed, between our sons, talking about possible birthday plans and movies they might want to go see. A warm light thumped in my chest at the sight of it. I hadnt seen my family so close since the boys were toddlers. Kim had a smile far outreaching any she'd ever had. I no longer felt anything negative doing those chores. I think the two of us grew a little bit from our heated argument.	Since then, our arguments have been far less common, which isnt to say they dont exist, but Im happy to say our marriage has inched a little closer to how we always envisioned it. Kim has spent much more alone time with the boys and I now have a daily routine for small chores around the house.	Funny thing is, the only reason I brought this whole thing up is because I just found that damn remote."
Tea For The Queen,"WRITER NOTE: This is a retrospective for one of my characters, Queen Esther Greath, through her eyes in Chapter 41 of The Blacksmith's Nephew. This also happens to be one of my favorite chapters I have written so please enjoy.It has been nearly four days since I, Queen Esther Greath of the Northern Kingdom of Rissindell, has sent my brave warriors out to save my one and only daughter Ruth. I have been hardly sleeping for the past few days. Each day, I keep on thinking about my daughter and each night, I was having nightmares which were being fueled with the Dark Wizard in them.One night, I dreamt that Ruth gave up hope and said I do to the vile villain having to marry him for all eternity. The next night, I dreamt that the Dark Wizard killed all of her brave warriors and took Ruth beyond Rissindell, never to be seen again. But just last night had to be the worst one of them all! Ruth was somehow conceived to set her soul to darkness all thanks to the villain getting into her head. And with that, the two of them appeared in front of me trying to overthrown myself.After the final one of these series of nightmares, I've decided that I should start drinking hot tea before heading to bed. I was never a fan of tea to begin with but with the endless sleep and unwanted dreams, I had no choice but consider it as an option.It was about 6 oclock in the evening at the Northern Kingdom. All was quiet throughout the night. Everyone in the village and castle were heading to bed early that evening. Ever since the kidnapping, everyone has been rather sad and depressed for the Princess was truly loved by many. The one who was suffering the most of them all was myself of course.There hasnt been much activity going around in the village because it was mostly Ruth who had made things such enjoyable. My Ruth would organize all kinds of events for us people in the Northern Kingdom. These events inlcluded: festivals, parties, masquerade balls, fashion shows, pie eating completions, singing and dancing contents. Everyone always had a blast at these events hosted by my lovely daughter of mine but with her gone and capture by the evil sorcerer, there was no need for such events.No one worked at all and I was completely fine with this. I wouldnt want my people to be out in case the Dark Wizard comes back to hurt them. Even the kids werent playing outside for their parents were awfully concerned about the evilness lurking about the village. Security was really tight within the week of my Ruth being gone. Though there havent even been any sorts of crimes at all in the village. This all made made the guards job easy yet extremely dull.Everyone and everything was quarantined expect for the knights and guards, for they were the essential lookouts during this time of need.With everything being on lockdown mode, I had made sure my people got enough food and drinks to last the whole week. My guards, knights, servants and I gave the villagers the essential supplies for all of them to survive by going to each household. Even my dear best friend, Flavia, and her band of Fanjesters helped out with the supplies.I had made sure that Flavia and the Fanjesters would stay at the castle for the entire week. For I wouldnt and didn't want them to be involved with any of this.They accepted the offer but had no spirit of playing any type of music since Ruth was gone. I couldn't blame them; I won't have the heart for it either. The band was in lockdown as well as everyone else including myself was in the Northern Kingdom.In my bedroom chambers up in the highest tower of the castle was where I slept. Before heading to bed, I had to drink my tea in order to try to get a good night rest. I sat there in my most comfortable chair near by the chimney which was warmed with fire. I wore a blue nightgown that night and with soft, delicate hands of mine, I held the cup as I felt the warmth given from the tea.I've requested a guard every night in my chambers while I was alone for I had feared that the Dark Wizard might want me as his next victim. The guard of the night: Aimon gave me my tea which was stored in a pot along with some sugar cubes, honey, and three cups all on a sliver plated tray. I offered Aimon some tea but he politely declined it.I then sat there and thought about my friend Flavia. We havent gotten talk much recently so I requested to have Flavia come join me for a cup of tea. Flavia accepts the invite, and shortly afterwards was seated on a chair next to me drinking some hot tea. Flavia wore a pink pair of onesies that evening. They also acquired white otters on it. She even wore some otters slippers made out of fake fur.The two of us talked for some time once Flavia was acquired for. We chit chatted about the Fanjesters journey across the country and beyond along with the my years of ruling and raising a child as a widowed parent over a cup of tea.There I was, a more relaxed Queen sitting on a chair by the fire accompanied by a guard, best friend, and hot tea.Suddenly the fire in her chimney went out. Myself along with my guard and bestie became startled. A flame came up from the ground. It took shape of a six foot figure, the Dark Wizard: Gerlard, who stood there in the middle of the room grinning at the three of us.Aimon quickly drew out his sword pointing it at the villain yet I held out my hand out for him to remain calm. He withdrew his sword but kept a very close eye on the evil sorcerer standing there before us.Meanwhile Flavia remained sitting there giving the villain an angry face. She didnt want him here anymore than Aimon and I do.Hello Beautiful, how are you doing on this lovely evening? asked the villain through his villainous grin. He was referring to me when he asked the question.What do you want now Gerlard? I replied. You are getting what you want! My warriors will be there before the week ends. Have you come here to surrender seeing my warriors potential of defeating you or did you want to kidnap me while youre still at it?Ive come here for old times sakes, the villain said. You see, its been years since we had talked, my love. And yesI know youre precious warriors are still on their way. Ive been watching their every move. But no, I will never surrender because I am no quitter. You should know that given our history together. Anyways Im good with just having your daughter as my prisoner and future wife.I responded: Save it! I dont want to speak to you! Youre the cause of all of this! First of all, you waged war onto the great people of Rissindell; secondly, you killed my husband, Ruths father; third, you made everyone including my own people fear from any magic of the sort; and finally, you have kidnapped my daughter having me to be stressed and exhausted. There is no need to talk to you. Youre just wasting your time.Ha-ha-ha, sweet little Esther...always blaming it all on me for the troubles within the land of Rissindell said the villain as he drawls forward. Aimon the guard quickly drew out his sword again while Flavia and I immediately stood up from our cozy chairs. Gerlard sees this and chuckles. Dont mind me, said the villain as he reached for the pot and cup from the table pouring himself some tea.Gerlard poured his tea very dramatically and slow while having the three of us there standing feeling tense. The Dark Wizard takes his first sip from his tea, sighs with relieve and replied: Ah, I do love me some teaMy dear friend Flavia then chimes in by saying: Im going to have to ask you to leave.Flavia, please dont provoke him, I whispered to her.Flavia looks at me and replied: Its alright, my dear. I can handle this. She then turns to Gerlard and continues on by saying: You shouldnt be here Gerlard. No one wants you here. You should leave because not only you have been stressing Esther out, but youve also have stressed me and the others out as well. All of this stress is killing me because of you kidnapping my precious niece.Ha, chuckles the villain while rolling his eyes. He continued: she isnt your actual niece because you both arent blood related.Flavia replied with frustration after hearing that comment: That all doesnt matter because I treat her as of my own. She is adopted by heart. Family is more than just being blood related. No matter who we are or where we have come from, we will always be there for each other. SHE IS MY NIECE NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY!I had some tears in my eyes. I've always appreciated that Flavia always treated my daughter as her own niece. But I had no patience with the villain at this point. Gerlard, Ill ask you one last time: what is it that you want?The villain stood there mid-sip while the I asked my question once more. He finishes his sip and then replied: Why I have missed you oh so very much my dear. The only way I can reach you is through your dreams. You and I both know we had a thing for each other until that fowl king had to come into the picture and ruined everything.I saw that coming. It wasnt surprising that Gerlard would bring those sorts of stuff up especially with all the things he had pulled in the past. He always had to blame it on someone or something else he has done onto himself. 'I cant believe were arguing over this,' I said this to myself mentally, 'especially when it was his own doing.'But with soft sigh, I replied back: Yeswe did have a thing, but that was a very long time ago before you started talking madness. You talked about wanting unlimited power and gaining control over everyone. Plus, I didnt like that we were secretly dating considering it was against the rule for a knight to be in any sort of romance. Reuben came to me when I was at my lowest. I was only a milkmaid having with little to no pay. When he visited at the Capitals market day all those years ago, he had brought all the milk he needed for him and his people. I could see his kindness from my own eyes with that gesture! He also saw something in me no one else could see and neither could I back then, which was my beauty. Since then, I have loved him and he loved me. Reubens twice the man you ever will be!SHUT IT! shouted Gerlard making his flame burst upward making him look a little taller than he was.Flavia and I both took a step back. Meanwhile my loyal guard: Aimon went in front of us while we stood behind him.The villain then takes his fist over his mouth and coughs, continuing more calmly now: I loved you and you broke my heart. You should have given me a chance. No one else did and here I was thinking youll be different. But nope, I was wrong. You cant be trusted. Not you, not anyone.I was quite frustrated and tired. I've had enough of this mans grudge towards me. Yet somehow I had felt a little bad from what he had to go through but even still, his actions were as of a madman.I sighed once again before continuing with a calm voice: I had feelings for you too but that was all gone when I saw something in you that I didnt want. I saw the ugliness from within. Im sorry for breaking your heart but I couldnt trust you either with all the things you had did in your past at the Knights Academy especially when you started the war. I hope you had made some closure today because I did what I can do for you. Now, please leave and never come back here ever again! And also stay out of my dreams, you creep!Gerlard responded:As a matter of fact: yes, I now have some closure. It was about time I did. You know, you and I are the same if you think about itStill holds true.The Dark Wizard then threw the tea cup into the chimney causing it to break in pieces onto the warmed logs. The villain then walks away to the middle of the room and slightly turns his head continuing: And thank you Esther for the apology. You were always apologetic.I was furious at this point from what he had said. For what he had said was true. In actuality, Gerlard and I were the same in a sense because both blame each other for what had happened all those years ago. So I threw my cup towards the Dark Wizard but as far as it went, it didnt hit him for the fire was already gone, deceasing to the floor.I stood there for a moment with some heavy breathing through my mouth and nose. Aimon withdrew his sword as Flavia attends to me and says: You must sit down, Esther dear.Yes, yes Flavia, you are right. Thank you honey, I replied as I sat back down back on my cozy chair with Flavia and Aimon watching over me. I sat there praying in thought as my eyes shut: Lord, please help my dear daughter and brave warriors come back home safe and sound.After my little prayer, the chimney fire came back after the conversation with Gerlard and the pot was now filled with lukewarm tea.As I seated still there, I thought about the knight rule and how silly it was. I've been thinking of changing it for quite some time now ever since I met Terrance all those years ago. I thought to myself: 'I shall have it taken care of once my warriors come back safely with my one and only daughter.'"
When Emotions Took Shape As Words,"There was a hurricane of activity in the hallway. The atmosphere was exuberant. Ignoring all the frolic, Monika sat at her writing desk and stared at the speck of dust on the window pane, without diverting her gaze even for a second. That tiny speck seemed to take in the myriad eclectic emotions that churned in her heart and created a whirlpool. The paper that lay on the table fluttered in air and made a tapping noise each time in stroked the table. The clock ticked at its pace oblivious to the turmoil in her heart. Her mind was flooded with memories. Both good and bad. She was married at the age of twenty one. Dave was a good man and a wonderful husband. He was everything she had asked for. Two years after their marriage, they were blessed with their first child. She had given up her full time job and worked at a quaint cafeteria in their locality for a few hours everyday. She juggled between her role as a new mother and a part time employee. Her pregnancy glow was replaced by the grime and angst caused by the newly acquired responsibilities. During their fourth year of marriage, they were blessed with another child. Tiya was joyous on knowing that she was the elder sister who got to boss around her sibling. John was the quieter of the two. He was more sorted and balanced. He was Monika's ray of hope. She had trusted that he would be there for her in her twilight years just like she was there for him in every walk of his life. Her birdlings developed wings and as much as she enjoyed watching them take their first flight, she dreaded the time when they would leave her nest and build a small world of their own. A few years passed. She was engulfed by the mid life crisis. It was when Dave suggested that she wrote letters. He had gifted her a stack of colorful papers and a set of pens. Letter writing for her was a form of journaling. She wrote letters to her younger self. Her eloquent words spoke about what she missed. She wrote reassuring letters to her older self hoping that they would act as a guiding light in the years to come. She wrote letters to Tiya and John, some of which were read and the others were left unopened. She never inked any letters to Dave though. Her feelings for him were to be felt and understood and not written or read. Dave was good at that. He understood her unspoken words, gauged her camouflaged emotions and wiped her unshed tears. Their hearts beat in synchronization with one another for almost four decades until one morning when Dave's heart stopped. He left the mortal world and took a part of Monika with him. His death shook the earth beneath her. Like sand slipping away from between the fingers, she had begun to drift away from life. Sunrise didn't carry a ray of hope for her any more. The days seemed gloomier and nights felt darker. Loneliness and distress took a toll on her well being. Six months back, she slipped and fell in the bathroom and injured her hips. She was hospitalized for a week and Tiya and John took turns to nurse her back to health. She returned home but her health was status quo. John and Tiya couldn't visit her regularly. They were busy building a little cozy world of their own, a world in which their mother had no place. So they had chosen the easier option. They left her in a convalescent home. The home had nurses and doctors who took care of her. A physiotherapist helped her with her exercises and she was slowly limping back to normalcy. A squealing noise brought her back to the present. She looked through the door that was left ajar and saw that her friends were playing with their grandchildren. They made merry as though their presence was permanent. They would all be gone soon and the inhabitants of the home would be loners again. The door opened and her grandchildren entered. ""Granny,"" they shrieked and ran to her. She hugged both of them tightly. A surge of warmth rushed through her veins and her eyes welled with tears. She peered at the door from beyond their shoulders. ""Where is your dad?"" she asked. ""Dad dropped us at the home and left for work. He will be back in the evening,"" said Tom. Lizzie was engrossed in her phone. Headphones were plugged in her ears and she swayed to the music. The technology made Monika feel irrelevant. She felt antiqued. Outdated. Old. Backwards. She felt low about herself. ""What are these?"" asked Tom pointing at the envelopes on the table. ""Those are the letters I have written to your dad and aunt. I'm yet to post them,"" she replied. Tom looked at her with surprise writall over his face. Lizzie removed the headphone and asked, ""Why do you still write letters in the era of cell phones and emails. You can just ping us whenever you want. It makes the job easier."" Monika smiled. She was relieved that Lizzie got rid of those clutches that held her ears and robbed her of the present moment. She looked at the letters endearingly and said, ""Letters give a personal touch and a tinge of warmth that the electronic messages lack. Writing a letter takes time and effort but when we put a pen to paper emotions take shape as words and flow freely from the nib. That doesn't happen when you type away on your phone or computer. That feeling of holding a dear one's letter in your hands is priceless. You can feel a whiff of their fragrance. When we read a letter it feels like the one who wrote it is conversing with us. We can hear their words, feel their emotions, caress their tears and share their smile. Letter writing is magic."" Lizzie looked at her and rolled her eyes. ""Isn't it time consuming? You can type and send a message in the blink of an eye. Letter writing is boring,"" she remarked.""Writing a letter takes time. So does forging a relationship. In the era of two minute noodles and instant fixes one doesn't enjoy the process of doing things. Everything has become use and throw. Read and delete,"" said Monika and walked to the cabinet and opened it. She reached for a mahogany box. Placing it on the table, she opened it. The letters were torn at the edges. They had seen the good, bad and worst days. Ink was smudged at a place or two yet they were precious as were the memories. The letters carried the words written by Monika's mother. It gave an account of their lives. Picking up a letter from among the lot, Monika began to read it. ""You have always made us proud,"" she almost choked. ""My mother had written these letters many decades back. Whenever I read them I feel that she is by my side, protecting me and guiding me. Letter writing might have become irrelevant with time. But it is cathartic and soul invigorating,"" said Monika. Lizzie nodded. She diverted her gaze. Maybe she had nothing to say inher defense or she wanted to respect her granny's opinion. She chose to embrace silence. ""I have written more than two hundred letters,"" Monika claimed with pride while Lizzie looked at her phone and nodded absent mindedly. The sound of pen rolling on the paper diverted Monika's attention. She turned and saw that Tom was scribbling away. ""What are you doing?"" asked Monika. ""Oh, I'm trying to write my first letter,"" he said. Tears threatened to bite the corner of Monika's eyes. ""Will you help me"" he asked.  Joy flowed out as tears and she agreed. Dear Ruby, I love your smile he began to write. ""Who's Ruby?"" she asked. ""My would be girlfriend,"" grinned Tom and continued to write. Monika helped him with the words. Lizzie watched them indulge in their favorite activity. Monika wasn't sure if Tom wanted to write a letter for his happiness or to make her happy? But she enjoyed the process. For the first time in years, she felt relevant. She felt important and useful. Tom was an empathetic kid. She stroked his hair gently and blessed him. She knew that a few hours later, she would be an empty nester again. She would be alone and unattended. She would have wait for months to see her children and grand children. But putting the painaway for another day, she revelled in the present moment. After all, the present was present from God."
You're Just So Intolerant,"Content warning: this story contains allergens!""I've thought about it, and it's chocolate.""""Well that sounds good to me. Thought about what?""""What you asked me earlier. Chocolate, it's a universal panacea.""""I didn't ask ?' is a universal panacea. I asked ' a universal panacea. It's all in the inflection and the emphasis.""""Oh, well you obviously inflected in the wrong place. That's so you. Nice pyjamas by the way. Are you comfy?""""Yes, thanks. I could have slept on the air-bed, I didn't mind. I like your jimjams too, cute little bears. So what is it then?""""I'm so glad you asked. It's the cure for all ills. Everything. Pain, sorrow, illness, World War III, the lot. I thought about it for a couple of hours and it's definitely chocolate.""""Erm, does the United Nations know about this? Or the World Health Organisation? Hmm, . Do you really think chocolate solves everything?""""Well, it does for me. Remember when I scraped my first car? I cried for a week but KitKat got me through it. And when Dan left, it was M&M's.""""You sobbed and snorted in the bag. It was disgusting.""""I still ate them. It made me realise I loved M&M's more than I loved Dan. He tried to come back, but I was stronger then. And he brought flowers from a petrol station.""""Cheapskate! That's hardly universal though, is it? Just you, and were they the peanut ones? I mean, does that even count as chocolate? And why is it universal, and not a world panacea? What works on Earth might not do much on Jupiter. Or Alpha Centauri. Or the Crab Nebula. Do you want that pillow? I could do with another. Ow, you didn't need to throw it.""""It's good though, you've got to admit it. If someone, or something, did turn up from Orion's Belt, you'd give them a Crunchie. They'd love it and not invade Earth, because they're full of peace and joy and Cadbury's. It's the pheromones.""""I think you mean endorphins. What if it's Hersheys? Or Nestle? Ooh, or Belgian chocolate, like those little seahorses and seashells with praline in the middle?""""Now you're just being pedantic. Mind you, I'd invade Earth for Belgian chocolate seashells with praline, or those hazelnut noisettes. What time do you have to go in the morning?""""My train is at nine so set the alarm for seven, would you, please. Sorry that's early, but I'll have time for Coco-Pops before I go. Get my endorphins going. I'm not invading anywhere tomorrow,""""Haha, you're good! But anyway I'm right, aren't I. Everyone loves chocolate.""""What if you're dairy or lactose intolerant?""Really? Like 2 or 3 people?""Forty two million, although most of them don't know it.""""You're blowing my mind. They still love chocolate though.""""Endorphinately.""""I hate you.""""You'll miss me when I'm gone.""I'm ignoring that. Okay, so it's a universal panacea for everyone who isn't dairy or lactose intolerant.""""Or diabetic.""""I'm starting to remember why I left home.""""Or gluten-free.""""Oh come on! A little bit won't hurt.""""Don't go there! I was sick for a fortnight last time.""""There's no gluten in chocolate. Is mum picking you up from the station? I have a birthday present for her if you'd take it.""""You don't read labels do you? Think about the KitKat. Yes, I can take it. What is it, chocolate?""""Funny. Okay, so we're settled. Chocolate is a universal panacea for anyone who isn't diabetic, or dairy, lactose or gluten intolerant. Are you happy now?""""You're forgetting soya. It's an allergen.""""What? Are you kidding? There's soya in chocolate? So far as I'm concerned, chocolate is the answer to 'life, the universe and everything,' not 42. Douglas Adams just had the wrong computer program running.""""But the best punchlines.""""I can't believe we're arguing over this.""""Who's arguing? You said chocolate, and I just pointed out you were wrong.""""Yep, you love doing that.""""I'm your sister. You should know by now, it's compulsory. You'll miss me when I'm gone.""""I'm still ignoring that. Why did you ask anyway? It's not your usual dinner table conversation. It's usually strange things.""""You mean, .""""I know what I meant.""""Gee thanks! Dad said to mum, 'wine is a universal panacea,' I wondered what he meant.""""Wine? What's he talking about? Was he drunk? There's sulphites in wine. And hangovers. And what about the Baptists? Or the population of Yemen?""""Yemen? We went to see that film, Salmon Fishing in The Yemen.""""I know. You ate my popcorn and drooled over Ewan McGregor. Yemenis don't drink alcohol.""""Oh God!""""Nope, forget God, there's been too many religious wars. Religion always kills someone.""""I wasn't suggesting God as a universal panacea, I was drooling over Ewan McGregor again. Although God is more universal than chocolate, I guess. Stop pulling faces. What's your beef?""""No good. You've just alienated the vegans, vegetarians, and pescetarians. And probably a few sagittarians. """"That's part man, part horse, not cow. You're nuts!""""Nuts? They're an allergen, and a choking hazard. You can't open a bag of peanuts on a plane anymore, not if there's a passenger with allergies. Did you know?""""Pfft. I'm going to choke you, in a minute! Or smother you with this pillow. Or let the air out of that mattress.""""Tough guy. Says, ?""""Sesame.""""Hahaha, do you fancy a hot chocolate drink before you go to sleep? And yes, sweetie, I will miss you when you're gone.""""Sleep, that's it! That's the universal panacea. Everyone sleeps, and like Mum says, 'it always looks better in the morning.' Go tell the world.""""Not if you've got sleep apnea. Ow, no, get off, get off.""""Night sis. Thanks for letting me stay.""""zzzzzzzzzzzzz"""
Escape,"The first time it happened Cassie thought it was a dream, that she must have been asleep, and dreaming. Since that day, now and then, she had felt a similar sensation when she concentrated on Sonny, in the sliding of taut muscle or the shiver of skin under the tickle of a fly. On this sunny summer Saturday, Cassie was sitting in her favourite place in Sonny's paddock, her back against the steel gate and her legs stretched out in front of her, when it happened again. The morning sun was warm on her shoulder and the side of her face, and glinted in copper shards from Sonnys chestnut coat as he grazed barely metres away. He munched with a steady rhythm, and she had closed her eyes against the glare of the sun, harsh and bright now as the morning stretched out.The next thing she knew, she was snatching the soft green strands between her own teeth, ripping with a slight sideways twitch, and feeling in her mouth the miraculous dance of lips, teeth, and tongue. She could taste the succulent grass, sugar-sweet and pungent.A cry from the house startled Sonny, and as one the two heads swung and looked. Laura, Cassie's big sister, was standing on the front deck and waving. Cassie! Grannys here. Cassie was sure she felt her own ears swivel and prick forward at Lauras call. Laura once had a friend visit who could wriggle his ears, and after he'd gone Cassie sat in front of the mirror and tried to make hers move, tried and tried, but nothing happened.Before she was interrupted just then, it had felt like she was doing it. If only she could be a horse! But for now, she was just Cassie again. She scrambled to her feet and hurried over to the house, the circulation returning painfully to her rear.They had moved here from the city six months ago, partly to be closer to Granny since Grandad had died, and partly because Mummy had excelled her highly motivated self to win an important job at the borough council. Since the move, Cassies world had changed in every way. She didnt like her new school. She always seemed to say the wrong thing; the other children didnt understand her thoughts, and stared or smirked at her questions. Mummy was hardly ever home, trying hard in her new job to make a good impression and prove herself, always at work, even on auspicious Saturdays like today. When she was home, she seemed distracted and unreachable, constantly finding fault and out of sorts. Cassie was never sure what she had done wrong or how to fix it. The only good thing about the move was darling Sonny, the elderly chestnut gelding who had come with the property.Her yearnings receded as she ran to greet Granny with a hug and kiss. She loved Grannys visits. She seemed to have a unifying effect on the whole family. Mummy would be lots calmer; she could even be quiet and kind. Laura played for longer with her, and Daddy tried hard, too. He often answered her questions when Granny was here, the sort of questions he usuallygrunted at or ignored. She was six and she had a lot of questions.Granny, can people turn into animals?You mean like a shape shifter? People used to believe that, once. They thought it was a punishment from the gods, or a way to escape unpleasantness. Granny studied her thoughtfully.Why do you ask, my darling?I think I was turning into a horse just before. Granny smiled indulgently, and Cassie was suddenly cross with her. Really, I .What would you do if you were a horse?Id eat grass and then Id gallop around and around. And then Id be itchy so Id lie down and roll, and then Id stand up and jump and kick. With enthusiasm Cassie demonstrated on the bouncy turf. 'Sonny would be my best friend and we'd be together always. And no one would be grumpy and shout and tell me I was naughty.You would make a lovely chestnut pony, said Granny, with your hair that colour. Its like Sonnys coat in summer. She gathered the little girl into a hug, but as she did it she tightened her lips and frowned over Cassies head. You arent naughty my sweet, youre a good girl.Mummy said I was naughty this morning though, said Cassie, twisting out of the old ladys embrace and gazing up into the sweet familiar face. I just wanted to see Sonny before breakfast, and she said if I went, I couldnt have any, so I ran outside with my toast.'Oh dear, sighed Granny.And then Mummy went to work and she didnt say goodbye.I suppose she was running late. Never mind, you can say Im sorry tonight when she gets home. Cassie agreed that she would and felt comforted. She would recite a little speech, after which Mummy would hug her and they would both say, I love you. Maybe then everything would be all right again.Are you here all day, Granny?Yes dear. Your dad wont be back from golf until late. If his day goes according to plan and he wins the club champs, he will have to stay and shout the bar.Maybe he wont win, said Cassie, and hoped he wouldnt. She immediately felt bad. Winning was important to Daddy, and she wanted him to be happy. If only he could win and come straight home!'Im sure hell win. He has been practicing every day since you moved here, hasnt he?Yes, he has, Cassie said. Every day. He doesnt even have time to read my story, and Ill never find out what happens to Harry and Ron and Hermione.She was interrupted by the sound of wheels on the gravel drive. Bye Granny, bye Cassie! Laura was waving from the window of the plum-coloured Corolla, the extra car they found they needed now they lived in the country. There was no public transport out here, so as soon as Laura turned sixteen she got her restricted licence. Now she was independent, able to drive herself anywhere she wanted to go. When she had her full licence, she had promised, she would take Cassie sometimes, but for now Cassie had to stay behind. Wheres Laura going, Granny?She has a practice for the high school stage challenge, didnt she tell you? Then shell probably hang out with her friends. Which means its just you and me! Hooray! Granny hoisted two fists in a victory salute, but Cassie turned away, bottom lip between her teeth, and watched the car until it turned at the gate and disappeared on the road into town.Laura didn't return until the sun had lost its warmth and the fence posts were leaving long bars of shadow on the grass beside Sonnys paddock. Granny left then, with waves and kisses. Cassie had prepared a contrite little speech for her mother, which she perfected as she snuggled up in bed that night. But the speech was wasted as her mother didnt get home until late, when Cassie was already asleep and dreaming of galloping and bucking across green hills as a chunky chestnut pony.It was another cheerful morning full of light and birdsong. Cassie woke to a restless urgency, and crept outside while the house slept, to watch the dawn with Sonny. The grass was drenched with dew, so she stood and leaned her back on Sonny's comforting shoulder, moving when he moved, facing the mound of hill to the east, black against a lime-green morning sky. When the first rays of the sun stroked her forehead, she closed her eyes and wallowed, lizard-like, in its warmth.It was much later when Laura opened her bedroom curtains and looked across the lawn to Sonnys paddock, to see a second chestnut grazing beside him, smaller and lighter with a deep russet mane and tail. She immediately thought of Cassie and how excited she would be. She hustled along to her sisters bedroom door and pushed it open. Cassie look, theres a pony in the paddock with Sonny, and its mane and tail are exactly the same colour as your hair. wake up sleepyhead!. The room was still dark, and she peered at Cassies bed, willing her eyes to adjust in the dimness. One corner of the top sheet trailed on the floor, but there was no mound of fiery hair on the pillow where it should have been. CASSIE? Laura turned and shouted through the open door. Muuum! Dad! ?Beyond the steel gate, the strange pony raised her head and pricked her ears. She gave a little buck, raced once around the paddock, then blasted back to stand beside Sonny, toss her mane, and stare."
Gingerbread Mafia,"Many folk tales describe hapless children marking their paths with stones, to not get lost. Now, its become a thing. Once humble hiking trails have transformed into gleaming, shimmering paths to a fantasyland. Or to the dark lair of a witch. Trends, fads and fashions prove spontaneous generation. Like love locks on a bridge. Who expects the weight of so many padlocks to threaten its structural integrity? What captures the popular imagination?Always innovating, the fad had outliers. A flock of birds reportedly swarmed a man tossing morsels of bread on paths. Another report described a trail of peanut butter cups. The sale of sparkling, pretty rocks had blossomed. And where money grows, the tax man reapeth. Investigators Hansel Cutterson, and Keith Chekov, drove into the mountains. Their destination, the Pebble and Crumb tavern. Their assignment, investigate the trafficking of semi-precious stones. Mere stones held little interest. But talk money laundering, and everyone listens. Local news featured two young men with a coin filled canvas sack. One walked a trail and placed a coin every few yards. Once his sack had emptied, he rested on the roadside.His partner followed a mile back. He retrieved each coin. Reaching his friend while lugging his bulging money bag, they would begin again. They claimed to be philosophers, and insisted they ended each hike richer than before.Hans never knew philosophers to flaunt their wealth. Could money laundering enhance their magic? The fad, grown so popular with young romantics, led to crowded trails. Traditional hikers and pebble pickers disputed over rights-of-way. Chaos ensued. Violence loomed.It fell to the tax office to rein things in.Legend held a witch ran the Pebble and Crumb, a ridgetop watering hole for hikers. P&Cs fortunes rose along with the popularity of semi-precious stones. Hansel and Keith pulled into the taverns empty lot. If you ignored the wicked witch subtext, P&Cs classic gingerbread design was cute. Aromatic smoke poured from the chimney of the converted cabin. The adjoining herb garden boasted a team of gnomes.Hansel said, Stay sharp. Ill do the talking.The simple bar had three taps, several small tables and vintage pinball and video games. Candles flickered. Black and white photos and prints adorned the walls. Keith pointed to a display case filled with various crystals.The wizened proprietress watched from behind the bar. Her youthful spirit belied her advanced age.Hansel approached the counter with a smile. Youve got a nice place here.Hard work. Never got a freebie in my life. They kept looking around. What can I get you?Just coffee. On the clock, after all.You a cop?No. County inspector.You look like a cop.The men glanced at each other.Hansel said, Ms. Bread?Thats my name. Dont wear it out.Ginger, right?Ginny.Business good?Better than usual. What you want?We received reports of increasedWait, I know you. Youre Cutterson. WoodyThats my father.Right, youre HanHansel.She began yelling. Moving about, brandishing a broom handle, she seemed everywhere at once. Stay back!Just have a few questionsOh, no, no, no. Im not going through that again. Get out! Hansel and Keith stood and watched. I need a lawyer? Calling him now. Shut you down so fast... Harassment! He knows.Ginger! Im not here for that. If I knew it was you, I wouldve sent someone else. Were following a report we received. No ones accusing you of anything.She stopped and gave them a hard look. About what?You know anything about moonstone trafficking?She dismissed them with a wave. NahOkay. Heres my card.She glanced at it. It read: Hansel Cutterson, County Tax Inspector. She snorted. It doesnt say anything bout inspecting pebbles.If you hear of anything, give me a call. Thats it.She stared. Really? Thats it?The men looked at each other and shrugged. She let her guard down. They started for the door. On second thought, Hansel turned.Since Im here, Ginny. I want to tell you how bad I feel for what I put you through, back then. Hope theres no hard feelings. She sighed and strode behind the bar. Still want that coffee?Sure Not being a hard case. Just doin our jobs.She poured two coffees and pointed to the creamer and sugar.So, hows Gretel?Okay. Moved back east. Got married. Im an uncle! Six times over. Think theyre in college now.Ginny laughed. She leaned in and addressed Keith. She was a feisty thing. Dont cross that chick.Duly noted.She thought back. Terrible what happened to that little, Ms. Hood. Her granny and I went way back. Nice old broad. Tough... What that predator did He got hisHansel nodded to Keith. Her tone changed. But that Goldilocks slut She asked for it. What an entitled twit.Keith spoke up. But she wasHansel stopped him with a look.Lost in thought, Ginger continued. Yeah Those were wild times. The press raped me. Never got to tell my side. No one cared.But you stuck around. Built this place. Did alrightI tried a new start. No point. Always some newshound sniffing around, butting in breaking a new story. Expos! Make a splash. Dish the dirt. Like a dog returning to its own You know Old lies sell better than a fresh, boring truth.The men sipped their coffees and listened. She refreshed their cups.Better hide in plain sight. Nothin to see. Move along. Nobodys got anything on me, that everybody hasnt seen. Just an old witch with no secrets. Like it like that.She looked about and stood straight. She smiled and gestured to the room.Has a certain cache, dont you think? Come curious, leave full of food and fun. Come back and bring friends. Businesss picking up latelyShe looked at Hansel and got serious. Hansel, dont you worry bout what happened. You were a know-nothing kid. But dont get me started on your sister He laughed. But you didnt mean nothing. Brought it on myself. Was the adult in the room, or so they said.Hansel nodded. She shifted attention. Want some live entertainment up here. With all these pebble pushers who knows?Hansel picked up the tab. They turned to leave. She said, Bye the way. Dont know about no moonstones. But if I hear something Someone I know might know someone You know the drill... But it cant come back to me. I never said a thing.Hansel said, Of course, Ginny. Good coffee, by the way. LaterThey exited into the early evening. A line of hikers approached the tavern.Keith said, Hans, what was that about? You know her?He laughed. Do I look like the brothers Grimm to you? I could tell you a hair-raising story about Gretel and me fighting for our lives, PTSD and waking up with the sweats. But I never met her. No sister named Gretel.Trying to understand, Keith shook his head.Hansel continued, Ive heard stories about this witch forever. I wondered how shed react to my name. You have to roll with it. Relax. Get her talking. Yeah, but she knew youHansel scoffed. This is why we need hard evidence. People like Ginger blow hot or cold. She could help us build a solid. Or she wakes up tomorrow, flies to Neverland, and pins the whole shmegegge on the little Mermaid.Keith laughed as they got to the car.Hansel continued, Once a perp called in Sasquatch as a witness to his alibi.Youre kidding!True story Try to serve that subpoena Had to line up three interpreters, in case he didnt speak English. Keith pounded the steering wheel. Of course, he didnt show.Thats crazyAnyway, we might might have a source with Ginger.So, Betty Boops for dinner?Sounds goodThey laughed as Hansel merged into traffic."
Why Is The Answer,"Are you coming to bed?The voice startled Jay, and instinctively he placed his phone in his pocket before answering. Ill be there in a second, what are you doing up? Jays question was more of a defense mechanism than a quest for knowledge. He was less concerned as to why Pam was up than  she was up.Do you have a minute? She asked, sitting down before Jay had a chance to answer. Ive been thinking.In the decade Jay had been marriedwas second to onlyin his list of things he didnt want to hear, but experience had taught him there was only one correct answer.Sure, whats on your mind?Do you remember our wedding day? Pam asked, And Pastor Richard?Of course. It was the happiest day of my life, Jay answered. His response was both true and ironic. Pam didnt come from money and Jay barely had a nickel to his name so the two young lovers had been married on a beach just before sunset. The guests sat in folding chairs they brought themselves and the altar was nothing more than two tiki torches stuck in the sand at the end of a makeshift aisle. Unable to afford a minister, Jay and Pam had been married by a friend everyone called Pastor Richard.His name was Richard, to be sure, but he was not a pastor, not a trained one at least. He was, however, the type of person who saw truths in life that most people didnt and there was no one else either Pam or Jay would have wanted to perform the task of joining them in holy matrimony than the unkempt but wise man. Yes, Jay remembered the day and the man, but the memory was no longer a pleasant one.Ive been thinking a lot about what he said, Pam continued, He told us that why was not the question, it was the answer.A smile came over Jays face. He remembered vividly the advice Pastor Richard had given them before they took their vows. He had squatted down in front of the couple and placed two dots in the sand a foot from each other. There had been no rehearsal or even discussion of the ceremony so both Pam and Jay were surprised with the sight of their friend as he used the only canvass available to him.This dot is you, he said, pointing at the dot on the right and then at Jay. And this one is you, he said, doing the same with the second dot and Pam. The paths of your lives have brought you together, here today, right now, he said as he drew diagonal lines from each dot to a midpoint between the two. You were on separate paths but no longer, now you walk lifes path as one, and with that, he drew a single line towards the young couple and stood back up straight. If you want to find the true reward of the oneness you seek today, youll remember that Y is the answer, not the question.Jay remembered how struck he had been by the simple lesson Pastor Richard had taught that day. Life was a path and he had committed to share his path with Pam the same way she had promised to share hers with him.Pastor Richard had a unique ability to see the truth and to share it, Jay said, smiling at Pam for the first time in what seemed like years, What made you think of that?Honestly I was thinking more about the warning. Do you remember?I do, Jay responded, instantly aware of where the conversation was headed, He warned us about being halfway in.It was more than that though, Pam reminded, He told us to beware of the paths to the side. I dont think we listened to him that day. I pictured what our life would be and this reality just doesnt match that picture.Jay instantly knew Pam was right, Pastor Richard had not stopped when he had drawn the Y in the sand. He had squatted back down and started drawing lines off the unified path. This is you choosing your friends over Pam, he said to Jay as he drew a line out to the right. And this is you, Pam, siding with your parents rather than with your husband, he said, as he drew a line to the left. Hobbies, work, and even children can be fatal distractions if you let them, he said as he drew multiple lines to the left and right. Before you know it Y is no longer an answer because its no longer a Y.Jay who had been looking at the floor, imagining the sandy beach where he had promised to love Pam for the rest of his life, looked up in time to see a single tear fall from his wifes eye.Is it too late? Pam asked as she stood up and turned toward the bedroom. Dont be long, I dont sleep well without you next to me.No, Jay said, with a certainty, even he didnt understand.No? Pam asked, turning back towards her husband.No, its not too late. Ill be there in a minute.Pam smiled and turned back towards the bedroom as Jay pulled his phone out of his pocket.The text was still there waiting to be sent. Jay had allowed pleasant conversation to become flirting and he had finally asked for her number. He knew the moment he did that he had crossed a line but trial and circumstance had worn him down. Now, where a lack of focus had dwelled only a few seconds earlier, Jay found clarity. It only took a few seconds to delete the unsent text. Y is the answer, Jay said softly to himself as he also deleted the contact from his phone and headed where he belonged, to his bed, next to his wife."
A Story About Someone Trying To Become A Better Person,"Here is a story about someone trying to become a better person.	Here is a carnival and a summertime of any year and lights and people and joyful screaming. Look at the sturgeon moon stamped onto the black sky. Now, if you would, walk out of the crowd and into a darker part of the carnival. You can come back later.	After a silent walk along slick, dark grass- yes, I know, a carnival in the dark? You're too bound by habit. Have a little imagination. Anyway. After your walk here is a single booth.	Here is a man in a dark suit, standing in his single booth. And here are the lamb heads stuck to the walls, eyes crusted with blood, definitely alive once and definitely not now. Now we have the pieces.	Watch. Here is a young woman, young by her own standards, anyway, with dark hair and a blue silk scarf. Watch her steps, focused and measured. Here is the wet grass of the carnival field and the man's raised head and small, ugly smile as she approaches the booth with practiced shyness.	""It's twenty-five tokens to try."" he says quietly.	Here comes her nod.	Twenty-five tokens to try. Tale as old as time.	Here is the purse and the plastic coins and the hands briefly touching, no not like that, she is married and he is not that kind of man, and here is the dagger, silver and angry.	See how the woman looks at the knife, like it could kill her itself without her intervention. Remember that this is a story about someone trying to become a better person, if you can.	Now, if you will, watch the man as he turns into the darkness of the booth. He's walking out in his polished black shoes to the backyard. Its quieter back here, away from the noise of the carnival. Theres a reason he chose to put his stand a little ways away. This needs silence. He comes to a stop in front of the tall wooden fence.	See, and I am sorry about this, but see the agitated lambs behind the backer rails. He's picking one of them up at random. He's a businessman, not a monster. He doesn't care which one dies.	The lamb, of course, is bleating and kicking and screaming, and the woman is waiting patiently outside, the way young women with dark hair and blue scarves are wont to do, and the man is walking steadfastly back to the booth as the lamb screams, for, what, its mother? The fence?	See her fingers run over the hilt of the dagger. Watch as she bites her lip; she has a question.	""Is it very painful?""	A pause. Remember what this story is about. Always remember. Watch as the man puffs his chest as he answers.	""No! As long as you do it well.""	(He means to encourage her to hit the heart. Many other patrons hit the stomach, and you know how that goes.)	""I will.""	Pay attention now. She is tensing her arm and clenching her jaw. He is doing the same. Who is more frightened?	Well?	Anyway. An adult sheep is tied up a hundred yards away, straining at her rope. Look at her panic, not a slaughterhouse panic but a motherly one. A panic of runningto rather than runningaway.	He closes his eyes, and she steadies something snakelike writhing inside herself. He lets go of the lamb and whistles in an entirely nonmusical way.	Here! Here, watch! The lamb is running across the fairground and her mother is bleating in joy, and the lamb's dark animal eyes are shining and catching the light of the stars! This is deeply joyous, but you want to see the woman and the knife and the man, I know.	Well, fine. Here she is throwing the dagger, something in her face dying as she lets go of the hilt with a practiced flick of the wrist. Here is the dagger spinning out! And here is the lamb stumbling on its long lamb legs, almost to its big sheep mother who will keep it warm forever!	She misses! The knife hits the ground, piercing the soil. The womans hair looks a little less dark as she retrieves it and throws it again at the hesitant lamb.	Daggers are faster than carnival-dwelling lambs, so watch, if you can, as the blade slices through the air for a second time. The lamb keeps its little lamb face on its mothers soft sheep body. The dark-haired woman averts her eyes and swallows down something dark before it can reach her lips or the cool night air.	But wait: she begins to shout in confusion and anger, but the lambs white wool remains unstained with blood, so what can be the reason?	Well, you were watching the lamb and the knife and the woman, and you have forgotten to watch the man, havent you?	Here he is running as the woman shouts angrily. Here is the man running, running, running across the slick grass trying to catch the knife as it draws closer to the inside the caverns of the lambs chest.	Here is the look of terror on his face, of regret and speed and trying-to-make-up-for-it-all. Here is the knife and the man and the man and the knife and the woman and the lamb and the knife and the night and the ferris wheel and the booth and the mother sheep straining at her rope! Here is the man and the woman colliding as he uses his manbody to stop her from taking up the dagger for a third time, and here she is in understandable shock, after all, he said twenty five tokens to try, and shes paid her twenty five tokens, so whats this?	Here is hand grazing dagger hilt and woman falling silent.	Men, as a rule, cant run faster than daggers any more than lambs can, and this particular man cant run faster than dark haired women with blue scarves. So, here is the dagger thrown for the third time as the lamb stands by its mother.	Nobody can quite believe whats happened. Then.	Here is a screaming, screaming lamb and an agitated silent mother stomping at the wet carnival grass. Here is a lamb that isnt screaming anymore, but, oh, a man that is.	Watch him as he falls to his knees in his expensive carnival suit, wailing to nothing, kneeling outside his out-of-the-way booth. The womans lips form a thin line as she stands up. He is screaming and screaming and crying and the lamb is twitching and the knife is completely silent in a rather self-satisfied way.	What the hell was that?	He wont stop yelling and kissing the lambs face and grabbing its hooves and holding his hand over its bleeding stomach. He wont stop shouting thick apologies to the silent sheep standing over him.	Just watch for a second. Dont forget who opened the booth.He stops screaming and grabs at the mother sheeps wool. Silence. The woman with dark hair and a blue scarf cant decide whether to stay or go. Shes young enough to stay.	Have you noticed the mans eyes? He doesnt have spectacles, by the way. Theyre big and brown and dark, and so are the mother sheeps. He takes the dagger from the lambs stomach, which makes its body shiver.	Here are two pairs of eyes. Here is one set of hooves and one set of manhands. Here is a thud of impact. Here is a perfectly placed wound. Here is puncturing vein and sheeps eyes dying and a second scream, third scream, fourth scream because now the woman is screaming. She should have been old enough to leave.	The man recovers quicker this time, watch. Now both a mother and her daughter are dead, not just one, and things seem more in balance.Wretched mirrors and all that. 	He stands up and brushes the carnival dew off his carnival suit.	You can take them both if youd like.	The woman is shocked. Watch her face in the moonlight; shes older than shell tell you. Blame society, if youd like. But, then, shes not that old, so blame her histrionic personality, if that suits you better.	But I didnt want you to do that! she says, almost a wail.	She did.	The  told you-	I was trying to be better.	Youve remembered the point of all of this, havent you?	The dark-haired woman purses her lips.	You probably shouldnt run this stand, then.	He wasnt expecting this. He drops his voice.	I know. I-	Actually, I will take both. The lamb and the sheep. Please.	He falls silent, looks at her as a betrayer.	Im under no obligation to be better myself. she says, impatient.	Itll be ten extra-	Seriously?	No.	Thank God.	He nods.	I can bag them myself. says the woman.	Shes not really asking but shes not really telling. I dont know. You decide, but remember its not terribly important.	He nods and they walk over to the booth together, both trying very hard not to look back at the two white bodies lying in the grass that is rapidly becoming crusted, not dripping, with blood.	Do you mind if I leave you to it? he says eventually, sticking a fork through the porridgey silence.	Not at all.	A few more paces from both of them.	There are plastic bags in the cupboard under the cash register. Dont, um, take any money.	This man is remarkably tactless.	Dont be ridiculous.	Ha.	Well, theyre my wages.	Dont leave me alone with your cash register, then.	Here is a woman with a point.	Here is a man averting his eyes as she walks behind the booth.	Im leaving now. he says, darkly serious. He looks at her with deep distrust. The woman remembers her mother and she also remembers the opened but uneaten bag of granola she has at home, which is going to go stale if she doesnt do something with it, maybe trail mix or cookies or just breakfast.	Okay. Ill get the bags, then Ill leave too.	She knows he wants to hear that she understands. It helps with trusting sometimes. You understand.	Here is a man turning away. Here is a man passing the bodies of a mother and a daughter and trying not to slip on the wet grass. Here is a man walking towards the lights of a carnival, and getting on a ferris wheel, and watching a woman as she does exactly as promised. Shes quick and neat bagging the sheep. Her blue scarf blows in the wind. Her skin is golden in the infant sunrise. He feels nothing.	Here is a man who is thinking about sailing to France, and the sheep in the fields of Old England, and not working in a carnival for the rest of his life.	Here is a story about someone trying to become a better person."
Just Playing,"Just Playing Simon peddled his bike through the woods, bumping crazily over the deeply rutted dirt path.He sped up as the path elevated to a gently sloping grade.His legs pumped in a blur like insane locomotive wheels.He laughed maniacally. 	His ape-hangered blue steed galloped over the earth fleet-footedly.The stallion was named Whiteboots of Lightening, Boots for short, named for his white-walled tires.In his minds eye Boots was of course not blue, how silly would  be?Childish to believe in a  horse stallion was sleek shiny black, like the one in that famous storyonly his had white feet and a lightening shaped white blaze on his forehead. 	His little sister Mavis (who would always be Sissy, or Sissy-Pants to him, cuz she hated it) used to have yellow streamers on the handlebars of her little green tricycle.She rode past Simon one day and he noticed how they waved and flutteredlike a horses tail. He had easily outrun her, grabbed her handlebars to stop her, and yanked the streamers out from the rubber handles.She had cried, Its not fair!He had laughed and run to their garage where Boots was waiting for his new tail.    	The path ahead narrowed and flame colored maple leaves crowded the tunnel.It was like sailing through a ring of fire, or a portal to hell.As he soared through, he shouted, Go Boots, cmon boy! Simons heart was pumping fast, fluttering like a birds	A second later, there was no earth under Simons wheels (Boots hooves)- he was airborne!	Whoo hooooo!	A Perfect 10 jump, as exciting as a roller coaster; every time he sped up the dirt path as it rose, his goal was to catch more air and sail farther.	Simons back wheel landed first. The front tire above his head.A poof of pale dust clouded behind him and whisped into the breeze.	Ah yeah! He fisted the air.His bike continued down the slope to the river on autopilot.	Down at the river, Simon dumped his bike and re-lived the mega-jump. He decided to ask Stan if he wanted to play the next day even though he thought the scrawny kid was a total dork; a dork who just got a Go-Pro for his birthday.Simon often picked on him in school.He did so out of jealousy because Stan was so darn smart.    	Theyd built a fort together about a month ago, with lumber theyd pilfered from one of the many construction sites at the edge of town.Instead of dragging only long flat boards into the woods with Simons Radio Flyer, Stan had grabbed smaller scraps of two by fours as well.Simon had scoffed but when they were finished, the new fort was a hundred times cooler than any Simon had ever built before, looking more like a pirate ship than a whinos shack.Stan brought a jolly roger flag and his Go-Pro, Simon brought Bruce, Sissys favorite teddy bear, as a sacrifice to Neptune when they christened their new ship.	Sissy had discovered the kidnapping shortly after the crime was committed, as Bruce was never far from her gravity, and ran into the woods after them.They werent hard to find, she followed the sounds of their laughter and discovered the ship.At the end of a four-foot plank was Bruce.The teddy was slumped over the edge of the plank, limp because half his stuffing was torn out, it lay in clumps like a small snowdrift under the board.Sissy had screamed when she found Bruces head under the fluffy white stuffing.She had dropped it in horror as if it was covered in blood.Then she had run to the bears body, but Simon had stopped her with his pirates sword (plastic light saber) Not so fast wench.The first mate is a goner.Attacked by a fierce hungry tiger he was!Yara huge tiger	B-b-but this a ship. Shed pointed a pudgy finger at the flag.P-p-pirate ship.	Yar! We were taking the tiger to a zoo.Yar.He escaped his cage and blammo!Rip rip rip! Too late to be saved, we really tried, honest we did.	Its not fair!He never did anything to you, you big meany!	Stan had had the decency to look ashamed.He was an only child and not accustomed to hearing little girls cry.Hed plucked the limp raggedy body off the plank and tossed it at Sissy.It flopped against her heaving chest then fell to the ground.As she picked it up, Simon said, Aw take yer dumb bear, we were done with it anyways.He had picked up the head and hurled it at her, nailing her square in the forehead.	Shed snitched that night to their mom.Hed made her pay.It had been the last time shed snitched.     	Now, at the river, he daydreamed about adding a ramp to his jump, and that made him think of building another fort, a spaceship maybe.Days spent building a fort were as great as the ones catching tadpoles, better in fact, since he had yet to have a taddy survive long enough to become an awesome frog. ha ha! he laughed out loud. He thought himself a kind boy, one who never failed to say a little eulogy with every flush of the toilet handle. 	With a ramp he could catch even more air!He rubbed his dirty hands together like Mr. Evil Snidely after tying the damsel to the railroad track. 	Mr. Evil Snidely was a character in his cast that he played when his pals were not able to come over.The scenario was one in which he tormented Sissy-Pants; the victim, one of her dollies.Sissy was kept in her place by the threat of decapitation of the poor helpless damsel, Then he'd gallop across the neatly mown lawn (He wasnt allowed to play noisy games in the house- no trains, cowboys, galloping anything) and duck around the corner of the house. Then hed come galloping back in his faux beaver-felt cowboy hat or his moth-eaten racoon cap, complete with bushy tail ringed in black stripes.	In the mini-Stetson-esque one he was Rock Courage, Sheriff of Schmittville, blazing in to save the day with his shiny silver revolver held high to ward off any Injuns lookin to make a meal of the struggling distressed damsel on the tracks.	If he galloped back in the raccoon cap, he was Doc Courage, Rocks equally handsome brother.Doc was an explorer who passed through town on occasion or when called upon to rescue some poor babe in danger of losing a limb to leprosy or some other such rare and horrible disfiguring affliction, he was, after all, the most highly acclaimed doctor in all the land, Schmittville and beyond.And if the patient was beyond curing, hed put it down with a blast from his trusty Red Ryder, loaded with monster exploding bullets, equally good for ridding the land of those pesky injuns.In either scenario, the weeping old Miz Sissypants, would inevitably be knocked to the ground in the fallout.	Just last week theyd played, and he had said, Dont you dare go crying to Mom. 	Her face had screwed up, red cheeks puffed like apples, the steam building in her panting chest, ready to let go an ear-shattering wailonly the screams of a little girl stomping in frustration could reach such high-pitched heightsears bled, and dogs ran for the hills. At last, the air in her balloon cheeks had escaped in a thin wheeze.She had stamped her little Mary Janes and cried, Its not fair!Youre bigger than me!	Thats right.I am.He had pushed her and when she landed on her bottom he added, Get used to it.Ill always bigger than you.     	He sat by the river; it was cool and clear amidst the reeds and cattails.  He was stoked to beat his air record.The day was perfect.He put his hands behind his head and was about to lay back and look at the clouds and think about his ramp. 	A movement on the other side of the river caught his eye. 	He sat up straight and realized a kid was sitting across the river, leaning against the sloping grassy bank, just as he had been, a red bicycle lay on its side beside him.How had Simon not noticed?It was as if hed popped out of thin air. As if feeling Simons curious eyes on him, the figure in the brown hoodie sat up too and after a couple of seconds, waved. 	Simon waved back.The other kid beckoned Simon over to his side.	Simon said, But this rivers totally ragin, Ill get soaked!	Thats dumb.Its just a little creek, not a raging river!Here.Lets put some rocks down, two each side should be fine!	Each boy dropped two large rocks on their side of the river.Then Simon leapt onto each one and onto the far bank, laughing.That was fun!You should try it.Pretend its really a river and---	Naw.	Oh.Okay.Youre right.Thats silly.Im Simon.He lifted his fist for a bump.	Sandy.They bumped fists and Sandy added a little finger burst with sound effects, Whoosh.	Heh heh.Cool.Simon copied the act, complete with a Whoosh. He noted that he was a couple of inches taller than the other boy and that suited him just fine.He was uncomfortable around kids that were bigger than him. 	Hey you wanna come over? asked Sandy.My moms making snacks.Ive been binge watching Lost in Space.	I love Lost in Space!Sure. 	Sandy picked up his bike.Simon had never seen anything like it.The frame was thick in the middle, the seat was a saddle centered between the front and back forks, each of which resembled thin red arms with claws grasping the wheel hubs.There was a face like a horses mounted between the handlebars, and the handlebars were shaped like horns. The face had bright yellow eyes with cat-like pupils. 	Simon said, Rad bike dude!Did yer pops make it for you?	Something like that. 	Sandy pulled ahead as the path narrowed and descended downwards. 	Simon said, Hey, this is a great hill! It looks just like the one on my side.Im going to build a ramp so I can jump my hor---uh, even higher!Youll have to check it out.Sayyou ever jump this hill?	Sure.Plenty of timesHow highd you get?I think Ive gotten ten feet at least.Theyd reached the bottom and Simon pointed to a spot on a nearby pine that he figured was about ten feet from the ground.Sandy said, Ive sailed  that tree.Simon gawped, his mouth hung open.Then Sandy laughed, his hand over his mouth, and Simon realized he was joking.He said, That would be so cool. 	Just like on Simons side of the creek, the road was about a half mile through the woods.The suburban neighborhood looked much the same as wellonly it was deserted.No people on the sidewalks, no moms with strollers, no dads mowing the lawnsand man, those lawns could use a mow.No cats or dogs no birds.The place was lifeless and silent as a grave. 	Its that one over there. Simon jumped as Sandy broke the silence.He had the urge to run back into the woods.	Theyre all at church, Sandy said, noting his new friends uneasiness.	Its Saturday	Yeah, folks round here attend the Proxima services Saturdays.He pointed west down the street.The church is down that way a few blocks.	Like Scientology or something?	Mm.Something like that. Sandy shrugged.They strode up the walkway and just before the steps, Sandy laid his bike down in the tall grass.As he did so, the late afternoon sun caught the fine iridescent flakes in the red paint and flashed so brightly in the yellow eyes that for just a split second, one appeared to wink at him.	Huh.	What? 	Nothing.	Cmon in. 	As Simon walked past Sandy, he realized the boy was actually the same height as he was.He figured theyd been standing on uneven ground.  	Inside the kitchen, the aroma of fresh baked cinnamon rolls filled the air.There was a dozen of them, dripping with thick creamy icing, on a cooling rack on the granite countertop.Sandy plated a couple and said, The living room has a bigger tv in it.	Simon realized Sandy must have a tv of his own.   	In the living room, they sat on floor cushions with their backs against a leather sofa.The tv before them was gi-normous, and  when Sandy hit the remote the picture bloomed into life and hidden surround sound speakers blasted their ears. 	Simon exclaimed, Wow man.This is like being in a movie theater!	Sandy pushed the cinnamon roll plate over as he bit into one himself.Mmmm.Mom puts a little surprise treat in the centers. 	Simon bit so deeply into his icing gooshed from the sides of his mouth and oozed down his chin.Hed bitten to the center.It was a sort of jelly, chewy like gummy bears, with a slightly salty taste.He wasnt sure he liked it. 	Good huh?	Uhyeah.	Simon pulled apart the rest of his cinnamon roll for a better look at the jelly.It was a gooey circular shape squished flat where his teeth made impressions in it.He pulled it out and slipped it into his hoodie pocket quickly before his friend could see.Mmmm.Good. 	They watched an episode of Lost in Space.Sandy laughed hysterically at the super scary parts, covering his mouth with his hands, a nervous habit. At one point a truly terrifying space creature was getting the best of Robot, Sandy was laughing, Simon was terrified. By the end of it, Simon was beginning to think there was a screw loose in Sandys head. 	After the episode, Sandy said, Wanna see my room?	Sure. 	The walls of Sandys room were plastered with outer space posters: The Milky Way, the constellations, the earth from afar, and more than a dozen of a planet he thought must be Venus or Pluto.He found it odd because it was so plain looking, not like Saturn, or the giant, Jupiter.The posters were top quality and looked like genuine photographs. 	Simon said, Whats this one?Its kinda boring.	Thats Proxima.Its not boring at all, its atmosphere is very much like earths.	Ive nev---	Just then a high-pitched squeal volted out from behind them.Simon whirled and searched for its source.	Sandy said, Thats Sid.Hes just hungry. 	They went to a glass tank on the desk by the window.Sid was a gerbil.	With six beady black eyes...And a mouth full of needle-like teeth.It gnashed them together and drooled.Every eye was focused on Simon.It stood up on its hind legs and walked like a human to the glass.Simon saw four more legs dangling from its pudgy body.It shrieked and clawed at the glass as if trying to dig its way out.Simon backed away until he felt something hard and pointy pressing into his back. 	He turned around.Sandy was holding the coolest toy ray-gun Simon had ever seen. Impossibly, Sandy was now two inches taller than Simon.He grinned wide, ear to ear, his teeth were slick grey like varnished pewter, and Simon backed away, confused.Sandy pointed the ray-gun at the floor and fired it.A blinding green-white beam shot from its tip, and a smoking black hole the size of a silver dollar appeared an inch from Simons left toe.	He only took his eyes off Sandy for a second, when he looked at him again, the thing that was not a boy at all was now four inches taller than him.Sandy laughed. 	It was the laugh of a little girl.Simons blood went icy as the thing started chanting, Its not fairits not fairits not fair 	Simon turned and ran like hed never run before. 	Outside, it was just after sunset, cold, and darkening fast.He lifted the things bike from the grass and pedaled faster than he ever had before, the bike was lightning fast! 	Through the woods he raced.In minutes he was at the slope.The bike didnt slow as it ascended.It went even faster.It sailed off the topand upwardshigh.The saddle between his thighs was warm.It expanded and contracted.	Breathing..	From under the saddle wings unfurled.They were membranous like a bats, almost see-through, and runnelled with thick veins.From before him, a barking sound erupted.	Laughter.	He was flying over the pine forest. The whooshing of the wings was like wind from a giant bellows.His eyes watered fiercely. 	Please.Please let me down.	Ark ark ark ark! 	They flew low over the suburban neighborhood- his neighborhood.Over his yard, the living, flying thing flipped over and sent him sprawling downward.The land met him fast and hard.He whumped onto the grass on his back, the wind knocked out of him. 	From miles away, he heard his sister calling his name.	Then she was there looking down at him. Whatchoo doin down there silly-pants?Moms been callin you for supper.Youre in troooo-bellheeeeey, what dat?	For you Mavis, its a gummy.	Ooooh, tank you Simy.He reverently placed the squished eyeball in her pale little hand."
Don't You Remember,"Dont you remember?Can you even see when you are sleepwalking?I am trying to remember officer, but it is difficult.My eyes can see when I sleepwalk, but I am not really very aware of what is around me. My mind generates images that my eyes dont actually see.I once fell down the stairs in my sleep, picked myself up, and headed back to bed.When I awoke I was quite surprised by the blood on my pillow.My mother wasnt though.She had heard me fall, got up and apparently she guided me back to bed, and washed the first flow of blood from my head.That is what she told me anyway, and I had no reason to not believe her. .I must have been able to see.Otherwise I would not have been able to get back up the stairs without falling again. What do you recall then from your walk in the woods last night?Anything come to mind?I do recall dreaming about running in a race in the track in my old high school.I often dream about that as I was on the track team.Anything other than just that sir?Well, as I told the other officer on the phone this morning, when I heard the news about the little girl that went missing, I do have a picture in my mind of seeing a little girl with very long hair that was a bright red.She looked kind of like a slightly younger version of Anne of Green Gables.I told the other officer that I was not completely sure that was what I saw.My wife and I had recently been on vacation on Prince Edward Island, and visited the home of the author of the book, Lucy Maude Mongomery.Now did you see anyone else standing close to her?Well, officer, this might sound strange, but I think that I saw something that looked a lot like a bear.There are no bears in these woods, sir. You are a visitor here I understand, staying at one of the hotels on main street.Im sure thats true officer.But now that I am putting more thought into that sleep-walking vision.I believe that what I might have been looking at was a fairly big man with a thick brown coat on.Now we are getting somewhere.I will call the little girls mother, to see if she knows such a man.Maam, this is officer Jenkins.I have been talking with the man who thinks that he saw your daughter last night, and called us when he heard the report on the radio,.Now this is going to sound like a very strange question, but I want to know whether you know a big man with a brown coat.There is a brief silence as the woman contemplates the question.Well, I used to know a big man, my ex-husband.I dont know about the brown coat though.I never saw him wear one, but we have been separated for two years now.Do you know where he lives now, maam?I am afraid that I do not know that.We havent communicated with each other in months.And he was never one to do much in the way of providing information.Well, give us his name, and any other information that might prove useful in finding him.His name is Christ Jenkins, but I dont even know his current cell phone number.Okay maam, well see what we can find out about him.If you can think of anything else, just give us a call.Once his conversation with the police officer was finished, the sleep-walker headed back to his hotel room.He was anxious to tell his wife about how his sighting of the little girl has proceeded.He knew that she would want to know everything.He was also searching through his mind for a reasonably accurate picture of the man who looked like a bear when he first envisioned him.He had no luck in that regard, but he would keep on trying.He and his wife had dinner, the table talk being all about his sleepwalking adventure, his conversation with the police officer, and his still failing attempts to conjure up a clearer image of the man who was a bear.His wife asked some good questions, but he still was a few answers short of being definite.That night he hoped that he would do no more sleepwalking, but there was a restlessness in him that sometimes would be followed by his late night wandering.Sure enough, not long before midnight, still dressed in his dark blue pajamas, he got up and began the zombie-style walking like he had engaged in the night before.He passed by a few people who stared in dumb wonder, but did not say anything, thinking that he was probably drunk or stoned.He went out the back door, as he had the last time.Again, like the previous night, he proceeded through the parking lotBut this time he saw something before he hit the trail to the woods that he had travelled on before.He again spotted the bear, but this time he rapidly changed into the figure of a big man wearing a brown jacket. The man was carrying something in both of his arms.The sleepwalker saw the red hair again.The difference this time was that the shock of sighting both man and child once more woke him up to where his mind saw clearly what his eyes beheld.He turned around sharply, but not before he got a good look at the number on the front license plate of the car the backseat of which the man was placing the little girlThen he moved quickly to and through the back door, heading for the reception desk.He took a chance and asked the male receptionist to call 911, but not before he told him, I have just seen the little girl that disappeared.She is being kidnapped.Fortunately, the receptionist overlooked that the man asking him to do this was in his pajamas, and did what he was asked to do.He was new at the job and did not want to anger a guest.The sleepwalker got on the phone, and told the officer on the line who he was and that he had seen the kidnapper about to escape, taking the little girl with him.Guided by the license number, the police were soon on the scene and caught up with the man and the child.The radio report the next day said that the man was the girls father, and that she had been rescued with the brave assistance of a tourist staying at a local hotel.No mention was made of his sleepwalking or of his dark blue pajamas."
Cheese and Honey,"Bruce Bear! Bruce Bear! The tiny voice echoed through the black bears den. Bruce Bear rolled over and checked his calendar alarm. He had been pushing the snooze button on his alarm for the past few days. His hibernation was technically over but he was not ready to face the new season. He sat up and stretched, raising his arms above his head and then scratching the back of his neck. Molly mouse? What are you doing here? Bruce yawned looking at the tiny mouse standing in front of him. Fantastic! You are awake! I have been trying to wake you all winter. Molly mouse squeaked. What is the big deal? Why are you so desperately trying to wake me up? Bruce rubbed his temples with his paws. His claws have grown out from lack of use over the winter and he nearly poked himself in the eye. The Smiths! The what? The Smiths. I need you to help me get rid of the Smiths. Who are the Smiths? I have been asleep for months, remember? Bruce was not interested in any of Molly Mouses games and wanted her to get to the point. Oh yes! The Smith family is a human family moved into the abandoned house just over there Molly pointed behind her. Bruce had no clue what direction that was. But Bruce was not interested in location, just in what Molly wanted with this human family. And why do we want to get rid of this human family? What did they do to you? Mollys eyes got big and then she said, The cheese. The cheese? This did not amuse Bruce. Yes, the cheese! I have never seen so much cheese in my life. There is Havarti, Swiss, Cheddar, Blue, Creamed, Mozzarella, Parmesian and Provolone. Molly counted the cheeses on her tiny paws, They have truffle cheese. It smells so good. If you want a piece of cheese, theyve got it. We are getting rid of the Smiths for cheese? Bruce asked, staring at Molly. Then he laid back down and turned his back to her. But there is more! I want the cheese, but do you know what else they have? Molly asked. What? Bruce asked over his shoulder at Molly. Honey. Honey? Bruce was now intrigued. Yes, honey. Bruce sat back up and looked at Molly. They have bee hives and collect lots of honey. So, why do you need my help? What do you need from me? Bruce gave Molly a puzzled look. I want you to scare them! I tried doing it myself but all they did was set mouse traps and now Im too afraid to go near the house. I need you to work your scary bear magic and scare them Scare them? How will that help with the honey? And the cheese for you? Bruce added. See, if we scare them bad enough, they will leave for good, and then we can eat all the honey and all the cheese we want whenever we want. But I see a hole in your plan. What happens when we eat all the honey? And the cheese for you? Molly mouse thought for a second. Bruce Bear did have a good point. As it was right now, Molly could sneak in, grab a small piece of cheese, and then leave. Just to return later. But then she remembered the mouse traps. It was too risky. But Bruce would not buy that. She needed to come up with another explanation. The bees will still be there, was her response. They will continue to make honey for you. And if the Smiths are gone, there are no humans to tell you no. And your cheese? Havent you heard of aged cheddar? It will be fine for years. Besides, have you seen me? Im tiny. I cant possibly eat all the cheese they have by myself. It will take me years to finish it. Bruce Bear pondered this for a moment. Ill do it! Molly led Bruce out of his den and through the woods until they reached a clearing. Molly stopped and Bruce Bear almost stepped on her not realizing she halted. There! Molly Mouse said, pointing to a cabin about a hundred yards from where the two animals were standing. Now what? Bruce Bear asked. Go scare them? How? I dont know. Just go be your scary bear self. But I dont want to scare them. They seem like nice people. Nice people? Do you even know them? Bruce Bear sat back, Well, no. But I feel like I do. I see their bikes. Two big ones and two little ones. And the smallest is pink. And I see their vegetable garden, ripe with tomatoes and look! It looks like they have strawberries coming in. And I see the national flag. And I see the stained glass in the window with a picture of an oak tree. And look! A dog house. These people seem like good people. Honey! Molly Mouse reminded Bruce Bear. Right! And at that Bruce Bear took a step forward and then another. And before he knew it, he was directly in front of the biggest window of the house. Not too close, but close enough. He peered in and saw the family gathered around a big table, playing a game of some sort. Bruce Bear stood on his hind legs and gave the biggest roar he could muster. His voice was still a little horse from all the sleeping and so he tried again and this one came out much louder. The family looked up from the table. All four of them had big eyes and wide mouths. And Bruce Bear felt content with his attempt and dropped back down to all four legs. But the family didnt move. They just stared. Bruce Bear took another step forward and tried again. The family still didnt move. Bruce Bear took one more step. He was so close now that he could reach out and touch the glass and so he did. He took one of his sharp claws and tapped on the glass. The whole Smith family screamed. As Bruce Bear continued to peer through the window, he could see the larger humans of the family both stood up and disappear. Then he heard a noise to his left. The two Smith humans stood, each with a rifle in their hands. This was enough for Bruce Bear. He liked honey but not enough to give his life for it. He will just need to find it in the wild. He galloped back to Molly, picked her up, and threw her on his back. He continued to gallop through the woods and didnt stop until they reached his den. Where is my cheese? Molly Mouse asked with the corners of her tiny mouth turned down. You will need to do without, Bruce Bear explained. He told her about how he scared the Smith family and made the whole family screaming. But his scare tactics were no match for their rifles. You will just need to live without cheese. Thats it! Molly Mouse screamed at Bruce Bear I bet Carey Cougar will do it. And at that Molly left the den. Bruce sat back and contemplated the honey he lost. His stomach grumbled and he thought about the last time he ate. But in the end, when he heard gunshots, he was happy with his decision to let the honey be."
Gabriel,"The cat with the ebony coat and pale green eyes sat on the fence post next to an elm tree where a family of squirrels lived.The cats name was Gabby, and the squirrels were his closest friends. 	Jeremy, a fluffy-tailed grey squirrel, climbed down the elm to the branch closest to the fence.He said, hey Gab, have you seen Juniper? Juniper was Jeremys sister.He had two younger sisters and an older brother.There had been six siblings at one time. 	Gabby said, Nope.Shes probably up in the oaks with Jersey collecting acorns.	Jeremy said, Yeah, youre probably right.Moms kinda freakin cuz of you know 	Gabby did know.Jeripoo had disappeared the month before and the family was still unnerved and on edge and sad.Squirrels are at the bottom of the food chain so as much as the Js parents mourned their losses, they accepted the fact that the woods were full of the claws, teeth, and the hungry bellies of animals much larger than them. 	Hey, you guys wanna play hide and seek?A voice called down from the elm.It was Joey, Jeremys brother.	Sure!said Gabby.	Youre the seeker first! shouted Jeremy.He and Joey scampered down the tree and into the woods.	Gabby cried after them, but Im always the first!	Ha!Thats cuz youre a slowpoke! shouted Jeremy, laughing.	Gabby counted to ten as he watched the squirrels tails disappear through the bushes. 	After the count, he took off through the same bushes.He looked around for signs of their passage: grey fur caught on sharp twigs perhaps, or fine disturbed dust motes in the air.He studied a clump of raspberry bushes and saw a couple of ripe, red berries on the ground. he thought and darted through the prickly bushes.	An obnoxious blue jay squawked ahead.Gabby ran towards the noise, the tuft-headed birds always freaked out when squirrels frolicked their way. 	Through a clearing and into a grove of oak trees, Gabby ran.He skidded to a stop at the base of the tallest one. There was a hollow about ten feet up the trunk.	Gabby thought, He jumped and clawed up to the inky black burrow and thought, Out loud he shouted, Here I come!And leapt through the opening.	It was deep.So deep, in fact, that he fell in pitch blackness a very long way.	He feared he would fall forever.Maybe all the way to China.	Just before seriously panicking, the tunnel curved upwards slightly, and he was thrown out of an opening and into the middle of no-where.He sailed upwards into a star filled night sky as if he had wings.He gawped in amazement at the earth far below as wispy clouds breezed by. , he thought as looked down upon trees and moonlit meadows.Though hed dreamt of flying many times and always regretted waking from those wonderful dreams, this time felt so 	The stars all around him sparkled like diamonds.The moon was the shape of a slender crescent and wispy pale mist swirled around the tops of the trees.His eyes were like night vision goggles, they were agog with the sights around him. The pleasant scent of a cook fire wafted his way. He looked down and spotted a lone cabin, the smoke drifting up from its chimney, and warm amber lighting emitting from its windows.	Gabby was drawn downwards by a magnetic pull. His paws landed on the ground as silently as feathers.This place felt magical.Even the coming storm clouds were a beautiful work of art, as mysterious and colorful as a Van Gogh painting.	Gabby slinked to the window by the door.On tippy toes, he peered into the cabin and saw a cozy living room with crackling flames in a stone wall-to-ceiling fireplace.An iron pot hung over the fire.A woman came into the room, she was draped in a dark woolen shawl.She wore flowy purple pants and short Ugg boots.	A rumble of thunder suddenly rolled over the cabin.	Gabby looked to the sky and saw bluey-grey clouds swirling like misty phantoms.	He looked back to the window	A flash of lightening lit the window up on the other side of the glass, mere inches from his face, was an ancient grotesque mummies face, curtained with long white hair like straw. Blueish lips parted in a wide grin, revealing teeth filed to sharp points. Gabby shrieked and fell backwards, his eyes bugging from his head.He dared to look up.In the illumination from the next lightning strike, the window was empty.	Gabby lay on his back and blinked as light rain pelted his face.	, he thought as he looked through the window again.        	The woman came out of the kitchen.She was young and pretty, not old and creepy.She crossed the living room and opened the front door.Welcome little friend.Would you like to come inside? Supper is ready and you look hungry.	Gabbys stomach rumbled.It felt empty, like he hadnt eaten in days.It was nighttime after all, and the aroma of beef stew wafted past his quivering nose.He salivated and followed the woman inside in the sort of trance one only experiences in dreams.	Inside the homey cabin, Gabby said, Yes.Please. Who are you?	Im Marjabelle call me Marj. She giggled like a schoolgirl.On closer inspection, she seemed about thirtyish.She twirled as she went to the kitchen, her pale hair like cornsilk in a breeze, and her purple pantaloons rippling like flags on her slender legs.	She came back with a pair of bowls and went to the iron pot.He said, Im Gabby---	She said, As in Gabriel like the angel.	Gabby said, I suppose so."" 	The young woman filled the bowls with stew and placed them on the little wooden table where two place settings were set.	Gabby sat at the table across from Marjabelle. 	The stew was the best hed ever tasted.She was a master with herbs and seasonings.The meat was tender, juicy, and gamey.The carrots and turnips were soft and though Gabby wasnt a huge veggie fan, these were delicious.When sated, Gabby said, Im confused by this place, here, where you live.Ive been hallucinating crazy stuff	Marj tittered prettily again.This is heaven.Heaven on earth. Its my own creation.Any creature who makes it here experiences their own heaven. Many wish to fly. She winked at him.	Why?Why do you do this?	The hollow tree is the only portal. I dont fit through itShe shrugged and her smile turned sad.	Gabby said, Youre trapped here	Yes, Ive been here for four hundred and thirty-seven years.Its another dimension, invisible from earths dimension, the one youre from.My father put me here.He was a powerful sorcerer but mad, quite literally mad. She pointed at her head and cocked it a bit.She was awfully glib for someone trapped in another dimension.	Marj noted the alarmed look on Gabbys face and said, Oh, you are free to come and go, dont worry.If you fit through the tree, youre good.Youll never find a mastiff or a donkey in here.	Gabby remained uneasy, the alarm bells in his head clanged like a firetrucks.	Marj said, did you like your heaven?	Wow. It truly was my heaven.	I know.Ive had many visitors, through the tree portal, over the years and it became my pastimemy artmy, um, I dunnoa way to make others happy.Doing that makes  happy.	I should be going home.Its so late	Actually, youll find when you go back through the tree only ten minutes has passed. *** It was true.	Gabby clawed his way up inside the tree (it was only ten feet again) and came out into a chilly March day.Grey, overcast, a little damp He felt a pang of regrethe already missed his heaven.	He went home and wondered if the squirrels had worried about him.	Gabbys head was spinning, and his belly was full.He crawled into bed for a nap and slept as if hed been up a week and run a marathon. 	Early the next morning, when the day was still purple-pink, the squirrels started shrieking.Gabby raced to their tree.Momma Squirrel was wringing her tiny paws and weeping while her babies consoled her with eyes full of sorrow and tears.	Gabby said, whats going on?!	Joey said, Juniper never came home last night.	Gabby had a thoughtone that curdled his blood and made his stomach fold over on itself.He told his wee friends that he was going out to search for Juniper even though he was pretty sure he knew she was lost forever.	Hey, you want me to come with you? It was Joey, the bravest of the siblings.	No!	Joey cringed and Gabby felt bad, he said, Im faster on my---	---But Im faster than you	No!Please.Let me use my catness to search for your sister. He knew exactly where to go and couldnt risk Momma Squirrel losing another of her babies.	Joey eyeballed Gabby a few seconds then nodded.Fine.  	Gabby silently made his way back to the enormous tree with his ears on high alert.Squirrels were very sneaky but not so stealthy, their claws made tiny  noises as they dug into tree limbs and bark.Every time he heard a squirrel his hopes rosebut none were his wee friend.	He dove into the hollow and eventually came out the other side into his sanctuaryIt was as before- he exited the tree and flew in the starry sky.Though he would have loved to fly for hours, he was on a mission.He made his way to the cabin and peeked into the living room window.No witch in sight.He saw that the back door in the kitchen was ajar and cautiously circled the cabin to it.	The cabin was as cozy as before, with a fire in the hearth and the welcoming scents of onions, herbs, and rich, meaty gravy. Gabbys mouth watered involuntarily.He scolded himself and felt ashamed.	His sharp ears detected no one in the cabin.	He crossed the living room and peeked into the pot hanging in the hearth.	A small white skull bobbed to the surface as he watched. 	The kitchen door slammed shut!	He whirled around and the witch was there!Hello there nosy kitty.She stepped towards Gabby, and he stepped away.I dont want to kill you.I enjoy your company.I even thought perhaps youd like to be my familiar	Never!Youve been eating my friends!	Yeah, well, a gals gotta eat.She shrugged her shoulders.But you liked flying right?Stay with me and you can fly any time you want to.	I could never trust you!I saw what you really are	Marjs eyes narrowed, and her lips tightened whitely. She lunged at the cat with her thin white fingers curled like the talons of an eagle.She screamed like one too.	Gabby dodged unexpectantly towards her instead of away and the witch stumbled.	She screeched as she whirled around.A wicked grin cracked her face from ear to ear, revealing glistening pointed teeth, as the black tail vanished around the corner and into the kitchen.	As the witch raced into the kitchen, the cat knocked over the broom by the fridge directly into Marjs path.It caught her in the shins.AAA! She stumbled to the linoleum, her head whumping into a cabinet.Oh no! Ohhh no.I dont  so.She leapt to her feet and grabbed the cleaver from the knife block on the counter.As she exited the kitchen, she said, Say night-night my furry friend.	The cabin was small and offered few hiding places.She looked around for signs of disturbance. She scanned the interior and sniffed the air.	Gabby thought, . 	He was hidden at the base of the coatrack by the door, concealed by a long velvet cloak.He noticed the window over the credenza on the other side of the door.It was open about six inches.A tight squeeze but his only option.His eyes flicked towards the fireplace as a shadow passed over the cauldron.She was heading back towards the kitchen.He chanced a peak out from under the cloak.	Gabby took what might be his only chance.He raced to the credenza but before he jumped onto it a black booted foot caught him in his side with a sickening crunch (not Uggs this time, but leather with pointy toes.)  He went sprawling under it instead.	Marj yanked him out by his tail. Every breath hurt, it felt like every rib was broken.	Aww, poor kitty. Marj dropped the cleaver and wrapped her hands around the cats neck. Wanna watch the life seep out from your eyes.	And she did.  	The witch was singing as she added more wood to the fire. Her voice lilted into the kitchen where Gabby lay unbreathing on the counter by the sink. 	And then he breathed.And listened.The song was familiar, an old classic rock tune.  he thought as he came back to life.	As Gabby lay, pretending to be dead, he felt strength building in his limbslimbs he was very happy to still have attached to his torso.His nerves thrummed with energy like live wires.Warmth spread through his deathly cold body.Over his head the kitchen window was open halfway.Gabby invoked every silent, stealthy cat gene in him and slipped out of the window as silent as a ghost. 	At the tree, he looked up and wished he could fly again.He scrabbled up its bark and heard the THUNK of the cleaver whacking the bark an inch below his tail. 	FFFLLLYYYY!shouted a voice from nowhere.  It was one hed never heard before.Deep and reassuring.	Gabby grabbed an ounce of faith and pushed off the trunk into the air.	He flew.	He didnt have the luxury of enjoying the flight. He heard a lengthy screech of frustration from down below as he entered the mysterious tree tunnel.  	On his side of the world, he looked around and sighed a breath of relief.The feeling didnt last long. A voice- the same that had commanded him to fly- said, Gabriel.Theres something you need to know.	Gabby looked back at the tree and spotted an unnatural pale blue light where hed just exited.It expanded and pulsed as if it had a heartbeat.The light floated down towards him. He stared in wonder as the glow took the shape of an elderly, ruggedly handsome bearded man.He turned to flee but the light man said, Dont be afraid.I am here to help you.You could say Im your guardian angel.He laughed warmly.Grandfatherly.	Gabby turned back and saw that the light emanating from the man dimmed considerably as his feet touched the ground.	Are you the one who brought me back to life?	No.No need to.You are immortal.	Gabbys jaw dropped.He instinctively knew the man spoke the truth.	I am Siris.An angel like you once were in another lifetime.	Gabriel	Yes.The re-incarnate of Gabriel the angel.Sent to earth for a purpose.The flying was not the witchs doing, it was all you.	But Ive never flown before yesterday	Did you ever try?	Hm.No.	The man spread his hands palms up, in a see, there you have it gesture.	Is my purpose to kill the witch?	Oh, no need for that.Simply destroy the portal.Shell live on forever as a vegetarian.	How can I destroy a tree?Im just a cat	You were once an angel.The King of Angels will grant you a wishat a cost. Siris paused a moment and Gabby knew what was coming.	Siris continued, Yes.I can see that you understand.You may only have that one wish- the closing of the witchs portal- in exchange for your heavenly gifts: flying and immortality.	Gabby said, I was happy before I met the witch. And Ill be even happier knowing my friends wont be eaten by her.	So be it.Siris glow began to brighten but before his feet left the ground, he said, At midnight the tree will die of dry rot and parasites.It will fall over and turn to dust; the portal will be no more.	Gabby nodded.He looked wistfully into the sky.It was as beautiful as his heaven had been.	As Siris rose above the tree, he called down, By the way, its only 10:30 now.Then he was gone.	The cat understood his words.He leapt into the sky and soared upwards.He spent the next hour and a half living his dream."
Mermaid of the Oasis,"Flashing lights danced within the aircraft cabin. The signs of danger swirled with the air as it conveyed certain death to its passengers. A siren sang in harmony with the screams of those beside Ammon. His best friend yelled into his ear like a muted television. He grabbed his hand and held it tight when he felt his stomach leap as the plane plummeted. 	He read the lips of his friend, Ammon, I just wanted to tell you  as fire protruded from behind his head. The fire swallowed every inch of his face; his green eyes were the last to be seen among the flames. 	Gasping for air, Ammon awoke from his nightmare. The others stared directly at him and soon returned to their own devices. The man beside him leaned over, Another nightmare, Ammon? 	Yes. Its haunted me many a night, David. Its been twenty years since Ive returned, he grabbed the bridge of his nose. 	Wow, that is a long time, wiping his glasses against his shirt. 	Some things I just didnt want to relive. 	 	I hate the landings, he grasped the belt against his chest with a python's grip. The plane began to violently shake and Ammon was turning paler by the second. A loud thud was heard as the wheels touched the desert sand. The captain opened the aircraft side door and ushered everyone out. Ammon stood at its exit staring into the vast dune sea trembling. 	I never thought Id come back to this place. I dont think I can go through with this, he turned away grabbing his backpack. David appeared beside him and placed his hand on his shoulder. 	Is that what Mallory would have wanted? 	Dont you dare tell me what he would have wanted. You werent there. You didnt see what I saw. Whats out there cant be explained and you want me to just go back into the lion's den and for what? A silly promise given to me by some thing? shoving Davids hand off his shoulder. He looked at his bag with Mallorys name etched into it. Releasing a huge sigh he turned to the exit and stepped into the desert plain, For your family. 	The harsh desert wasted no time bearing its ruthless teeth on these travelers. Within minutes two members already returned to the aircraft with heatstroke. As the days passed not much comradery was formed as their chances of survival were at an all-time low and the desert constantly pushed them to their limits. They shared a tent at night to stay warm as the temperature dropped to freezing conditions and when they woke one morning they found that another person didnt make it. David was the first to say something, Damnit, a fucking nother one. What is with this desert? Its like it's purposely trying to keep us from getting to this treasure, Ammon. 	Ammon zipped his shrinking bag closed, I told you all that this is no ordinary trip. Things happen here that arent natural. If you want me to be honest I think Lucca got it easy, in his sleep and quiet. The others werent so lucky last time. I can still hear them screaming. 	Yeah, I remember the stories. We better find this meeting place soon or there wont be any more of us left to meet this so-called . 	Hey! Dont believe me if you want. I dont know what else to call it. Her. Whatever it, she is, strapping on his backpack, leaving with one final glare at David. 	The day went on as they followed Ammon through the vast nothingness of the desert. Murmurs of disbelief that there were treasures to be found or even a  circulated the group. Ammon ignored them as he had for the past twenty years. No one ever believed him so why would they start now? David was the only one who actually listened and put this band of misfits together for Ammon, and he never questioned why each person was willing to risk their life for this story. 	Look, Ammon, I know we set out on this journey to help Mallorys family, to help his granddaughter. The others are starting to talk and I just wanted you to know that I have your back, smiling towards Ammon showing his pearly white teeth. His glasses slipped off his crooked nose and fell beside his feet. Reaching into the sand he pulled his hand out quickly and placed his finger in his mouth. Oww! Shit, that hurt. 	Ammon stared at Davids feet and the others gathered around to see what had happened. Of course! The sand would have buried the wreckage. This is where I survived the plane crash. Were getting closer, he checked his compass, and without hesitation went further into the desert. 	Setting up camp at nightfall they all gathered around the campfire exchanging stories of their lives and what they would like to buy when they found this treasure. Ammon never chimed in, he just stared into the flames for hours. David looked to Ammon, furrowed his brow sitting beside him, You okay Ammon? 	Moments passed in silence and David began to leave. It was a night like this when it happened. Over in a flash and there I was, laying in this desert with blood-soaked clothes. I could still hear their screams as their burning bodies illuminated the night. I could barely move at this point. I searched for Mallory but just couldnt find him, reaching into his pocket he pulled out a butterfly pin. David studied the pin and returned his gaze to Ammon as he put it away. 	I couldnt believe it, he was gone. We were just two kids looking for an adventure in the jungles of Africa. Explore the unknown and find treasures and relics never before seen. What a grand dream we held and it came crashing down as soon as we touched this sea of nightmares, he took out a flask and took a hard gulp. 	I found him a few days later, though I didnt recognize him at first. If it wasnt for his bag, his gaze shifted from the fire to the bag then searched for Davidss eyes, he lay there in agony David. His eyes swelled with tears, My best friend in the whole world who was there for me when my father beat my mother to death in a drunken rage. Do you know what that's like? David shook his head. Ammon took another hard gulp of the flask, he asked if help was on the way. Of course, I had no idea and was praying that someone knew what happened. The captain had sent a distress signal, though being able to pinpoint our location was difficult as I found out later in my rescue. David, this desert isnt normal. Things are here that shouldnt be. Maybe, its us that shouldnt be here. This pin was in his bag. 	So why do you have it now? Wouldnt you have given it to his daughter? 	She gave it back to me as a reminder of the promise I gave to Mallory. I cant fail this time. I cant fail Mallory again. I will find this promised treasure and pay to save his granddaughters life. They have suffered too much in this life, he took the final gulp from the flask. Staring hard at David he took in a giant breath holding it for a moment. David backed away quickly ready to reach for his sweat rag anticipating drunken puke. As Ammon heaved out his breath violently he slouched over and fell asleep instantaneously. David stared bug-eyed, shook his head, and retired to the tent with the others. 	GYAH! Maurice was found pointing and shouting that something was in the sand. The others gathered beside him scanning the desert. I guess we are all a little spooked? David said as he patted Maurices shoulder and went back into the tent. 	I know what I saw! the others just nodded whispering their disbelief and soon their memory of the event eroded. They gathered around Ammon, who was wrapped in a cocoon of blankets from head to toe, ready to depart. 	I cant believe he just slept through all of that. 	Has he always slept this heavy before? 	No, but he is having a challenging time guys, David began to prod Ammon to life. Ammon's eyes searched the surroundings, squinting at those near to him. His eyes widened raising his hands to his face massaging it the same way you'd take a napkin and squish a bug beneath it. Clambering to his feet he gathered his things without a word. He stared at the compass waved to the crew and drudged onward into the dune sea once more. 	What is that Ammon? David was pointing into the distance. Putting his hands above his brow he noticed that there was a black dot flashing every few seconds. 	Hmm, its random so I dont think it's morse code, David was writing in his small journal. 	Ammon gave him a look of confusion, What? Stories for my kids one day. Ammon quickly squeezed his eyes and relaxed them as he turned back towards the black dot in the sand. I suggest we take caution, like I said we arent the only things here and that could very well be the thing that took Mallorys life. 	The closer they got the wilder the dot seemed to move. As a tadpole grows its legs so did this dot. The dot now had arms and was splashing in and out of the sand like a dolphin. Their pace increased and they were whispering among one another trying to guess what it could be. Ammon was staring intently and didnt take notice of any question that was being asked of him. 	Ammon! What is that thing? David grabbed Ammons arm. Jerking his arm back keeping his gaze among the creature, David, Im sure this is the monster that killed Mallory before I was saved by that . Davids eyes darted back and forth towards the creature, Whoa! Are you sure? 	No! reaching his arm out towards the group they all stopped. 	The dot had stopped and a slender silhouette of a female-like figure stared directly at the group. It dove into the sand. The group took a step back searching the area. 	Remain calm and stay alert, drawing his hunter's knife Ammon lowered his stance. 	It burst from the sand showering golden stars on the group. They covered their eyes and some let out wails of terror. Ha ha ha, humans are so easy to scare, the creature said showing their sharp teeth. With only half of its body exposed from the sand, it was female-like in form only. Its skin was covered in scales that shimmered like gold and many of its joints had spike-like shapes that flexed as if it was breathing. The face was missing a nose and the navy blue hair was as slimy as it was shiny. Its black eyes with red pupils bounced around to see each person. 	Ansa, is that you? Ammon walked towards the . 	So you have finally returned as promised? 	I did, though I didnt want to. Im only doing this for Mallory and to collect only enough to save his family. 	Such a noble human, and since you did save my life I will lead you to our Oasis. 	Lead the way, and stop staring, fellas, the group quickly picked up their jaws from the floor pretending to be looking at things in their bags. Ansa took a dive and their legs were seen with giant flippers where their feet should be and rainbow-colored fins that followed down the sides of its legs. The sand bulged as Ansa swam through the desert occasionally, playfully telling the group just how slow they were. David stayed very close to Ammon, Can we trust this thing? 	We can, they saved me when I was on the verge of death, David. I had no one else to help me with Mallory and then it came along. 	Okay, if you say so. I cant believe something like this even exists. I can understand why no one would believe this. Its not something you can describe in believable words, pushing his eyebrows together and upward he let a soft smile reach Ammon. 	Night arrived eerily fast this day, and worried looks were exchanged as the crew noticed gathering around the campfire once more. Ansa had already made a nest of deep clay, dry plants, and sticks. 	So, Ansa was it? How did Ammon save you? David moved to sit closer to them. 	Ah, yes, I forget you humans are so tightly knit for companionship. Not something our kind tends to do. We only work together for food. 	Blurting quickly and loud Ammon spoke aggressively, Nothing really to tell! I saved Ansa from some other creature and she took me to the oasis before I was rescued. There... Story over. Get some rest everyone. Ammon took a violent swig of his flask. David turned to face the , So is that all that happened? 	With an unsettling smile, In short, yes that is what happened. I found your friend Ammon there with a companion who was in terrible shape. We were resting just like we are now when it attacked us. 	What attacked you? the crew leaned in closer. 	Pistrisvir. Very aggressive and lone hunters. Twice the size of my kind and took the companion very quickly before anything could be done. I was attacked and Ammon stabbed the creature in the head. It vanished and we never saw it again. 	Wow, how very lucky, the crew were praising and tapping Ammon on his arm and legs. 	Yes, how so very lucky that you all did not have to watch someone you love die before you, silence filled the air. Their heads dropped in unison. I suggest we sleep and rest up. 	That would be a wise idea, Ansa curled into their nest as they slowly closed their eyes. 	David put his journal into his bag and walked beside Ammon placing his hand on his shoulder as tears fell. Ammon didnt look back at him, only drinking from the flask. David choked the words  before going to the tent. 	In the early morning light, Ansa took the lead once more and the crew followed suit. The silence from the night before accompanied the group until Ansa raised their arm. This is it! You all made it! How delightful. 	What do you mean we made it Ansa, there is nothing here? Ammon stomped ahead of Ansa gesturing around them. 	Do you think this is a place that humans could find on their own? Otherwise, would you hunt us down and take all of our treasure for yourselves? For eons you humans have always done what you wanted and showed time and time again just how greedy you truly are. 	Truer words have never been spoken, Ansa. David shifted from foot to foot. But we are here to help a fellow human friend. I was saved by Ammon who taught me that I wasnt alone after having my parents taken away so quickly due to a drunk driver. 	David. Ammon had only heard him speak of this once in his life. 	Its okay Ammon, I just want Ansa to know that we are doing this for good. 	What a nice human you are and quite handsome. Your type has always been my favorite. 	Blushing, David rushed the words, Thank you! 	So how do we get into this oasis? said Ammon checking his compass. 	Ah, yes, sorry I was caught up in something, she disappeared among the sand. A burst of sand flew towards the crew, and with increasing speed, Ansa could be seen swimming in a circle shape. The sky turned purplish grey and the field of view in front of them began to melt away revealing an oasis. The water was crystal clear and gold could be seen at the bottom of its lake. The crew walked to the water's edge. 	Go ahead and have a drink, Ansa dived into the pool. 	David and the others followed directions and began taking handfuls of water wastefully spilling and drinking to their heart's content. They collapsed sporadically. 	What's going on! shouted Ammon as he ran to their aid. Before he could reach David the sand exploded and before him stood a man-like creature with grey scales. Their face also had no nose and their giant teeth couldnt be contained. Beady black eyes stared into Ammons. In a flash, the creature grabbed Ammon by the neck and held him into the air. His eyes filled with anger, Ansa, you promised me! 	I did, didnt I? But I also said that our kind only work together for food and the desert is a harsh place. 	When she spoke he realized that the creature holding him had a giant scar on his face, You! The creature smiled, slowly unhinging their jaw until their mouth was larger than Ammons head. His eyes widened and let out a scream before violently being interrupted. His head was severed in a single bite, lets hope its not another twenty years before we eat again, shall we, Ansa? 	Ansa wiped the blood off her mouth and grinned."
Nothing But Blue Skies,"Your husband tells me you cant sleep.I explained to him--Is his name Frank?I explained to Frank that its not that youre not sleeping. Its that youre not sleeping . Youre getting some sleep here and there whether you know it or not. The trouble is that its of no quality. Sleep is like food--theres the good kind and the bad kind. Youre getting potato chip sleep. You need carrot stick sleep. Did you ever show your children the food pyramid when they were younger? Not that its any of my business what you did or didnt show your children. I never had children. I told myself if I was going to have children I would want nine girls. If I couldnt guarantee myself that Id have nine girls, I wouldnt bother at all. So I never bothered. I got a lot of sleep though.Thats just a little joke.My mother used to beg me not to joke. Shed say Crystal, you are my golden child. My gem. My Faberge egg. But you are not funny and never will be.She had a talent for honesty.Now your husband, Frank--Is his name Frank?--Hes at a hotel tonight. Itll just be you and me. I brought some yarn, because Im working on--I work on all kinds of little projects. I hope you dont mind. Im making some blue. Isnt blue a lovely color? Everything I do, I opt for blue. Blue sweaters, blue blankets. I never had enough blue growing up. I didnt see colors until I was fourteen. It broke my heart. Id look at a fresh strawberry and it was no different than looking at a newspaper in terms of the aesthetic. On my fourteenth birthday, I was helping my father fix something on our roof. I had to help him, because both my brothers were scared of heights. I wasnt scared of anything. While I was up there, I felt a dizzy spell come over me. The next thing I know, Im down on the ground. My mother saw me come down right in front of the kitchen window. She screamed bloody murder. The scream was what woke me up. I opened my eyes, and what did I see?Blue.These beautiful blue skies.From that moment on, I could see any color I wanted. My mother and father said it was a miracle. , I thought. Some girl who saw the world as dull and gray could suddenly see maroon and aqua. I thought miracles were supposed to be all about healing those who couldnt walk or saving the souls of the damned. I felt selfish. An entire miracle wasted on me being able to appreciate a blue sky. My mother told me not to question it. Who knows what would happen now that Id been made better? Maybe that meant I was supposed to do something with all these colors I was seeing. Become a painter or a writer of some kind. I never did either, but I did pay attention to the little ways people can be assisted when theyre struggling. When I turned eighteen, I started posting little notices all around my town.Potential meaning--I dont know if I can actually do miracles. It seems to me that if someones had a miracle bestowed upon them, it might have rubbed off a bit.I found out pretty quickly that I have no skill at healing the injured. I cant make ignorant people worldly or hateful people kind. I laid hands on my cousin Sherman, who could never remember anybodys birthday, and his bad memory stayed bad.When I had no luck with people, I tried animal and mineral. The family dog was missing an eye, and no matter how hard I prayed over him, the eye never grew back. Dead plants remained dead. I tried to turn a head of lettuce into a cabbage--a simple enough miracle, I would think. Nothing doing.Its all right, Crystal, my father comforted me as I held the leafy green, I never did like cabbage too much anyhow.It wasnt until my sophomore year of college that I discovered I could do miracles after all. My roommate, Rhonda--I think her name was Rhonda?--She had trouble getting that carrot stick sleep. Shed toss and turn all night. Finally, one night, I said to her, Rhonda, Id like to try and perform a miracle on you, if youre up for that.Rhonda looked at me like I was a talking pentagram, and I guess I dont blame her. She came from a family of atheists and Communists, and people were always trying to show her Jesus in their cornflakes in the mess hall at breakfast. I let her know I wasnt trying for a conversion. Just wanted to contribute to the positive energy of the Universe.The poor thing was so exhausted, I think she would have let Ivan the Terrible sing a lullaby to her if it would have helped. Ivan was probably a better singer than me, so I didnt try anything like that. I just sat across from Rhonda--I think her name was Rhonda. Rhonda or Rhoda like from --I sat across from her and I told her Id be right there, sitting awake, if she felt like sleeping.Now, she must have thought that was the dumbest thing shed ever heard, because what good does somebody sitting across from you do when youre trying to sleep? If anything, it should make you self-conscious, shouldnt it? Somebody staring at you? Eyeballing you while youre trying to give your beleaguered body some respite? But something in my soul told me that was what Rhonda needed, and you know what?She passed out in two minutes flat.Well, once word got out that I could put people to sleep, I was loaded with requests. It turns out college students live and breathe off potato chip sleep, and if I could help get them to the higher plane of REM, theyd have more energy for studying--or partying. Thats how I ended up sitting across from someone every night until they went to sleep. Two minutes was all it took--sometimes less. Nearly all of them offered to pay me, but I wouldnt hear of it. I was so excited to finally have a gift, there was no way I was going to risk losing it by using my ability for selfish reasons.Not to mention the fact that as soon as I found my first gift, my second one came along right behind it. You see, once I started helping other people sleep, I noticed I didnt need any sleep of my own.Oh sure, Id try.As soon as my nightly charge was awash in slumber, Id retire to my own bed--but nothing would happen. Id just lay there. The wild part was that it didnt affect me whatsoever. Every morning Id get out of bed feeling as revived and refreshed as if Id slept like Van Winkle under his tree. I told my doctor about it, and he explained to me in a very slow-moving voice, that I had to be getting sleep. That there was no way I could exist without it. He said Id die if that was the case.That was nearly forty years ago.I havent died. I havent slept. And I can still get anybody to sleep in two minutes or less--free of charge.Once somebody asked me if I miss sleeping. I couldnt lie and say I didnt. I used to have wonderful dreams every night about flying over the great mountain ranges of the world. Soaring through the blue skies--especially once I knew what blue was. Then again, you have to sacrifice if you want to do good in this world. I lose some sleep, and somebody else gains the sleep I lost. Seems like a fair trade to me. And all that extra time comes in handy. For one thing, I always get my taxes done early.Most of the time Im there when somebody wakes up. To see the realization on their faces that theyve been asleep when they thought they were going to be eating potato chips forever? It moves me every time. The doctor who saves your life may be like a god to some people, but the woman who tells you shell be there if you feel like letting yourself go for a few hours so nobody comes along to harm you might just be an angel.Oh yeah, thats how I think of it. Maybe the reason people cant sleep is because we have it conditioned in our bones to never be vulnerable. Never weak. Never at risk of having somebody or something hurt us. So as much as we tell ourselves to give in to rest, another more primal part of us fights back. It might go back to the Stone Age days, I bet. Chances are, nobody got any real sleep until we started sleeping in packs. In communities. One person always stayed up with the fire to make sure nothing bad happened. Even then, I bet some people had a hard time. Why wouldnt they? Good sleep is a matter of trust. Its hard to trust these days.Some people think of me as a kind of Sleeping Angel, but I dont see it that way at all. I just think something about me is easy to trust, and this is one of the benefits. You see me sit down across from you, and that part of your brain thats been keeping you up says--The next thing you know, youre flying through those blue skies just like I used to do.Ill admit its not much of a miracle, but--Oh, would you look at that.And I didnt even have time to sit down.Well, some are easier than others, I suppose.Better go call--Frank?Is it Frank?You know what?Never mind.Ill ask you when you wake up."
For the Rest of My Life,"Their high school friends had gone on ahead, laughing and teasing one another, yet the thought of entering the Fall Festivals Howl-O-Scream terrified her. It was the  what lurked in the darkened corners that bothered her the most. She hated being surprised.Are you ready? her boyfriend asked. What an insubstantial word for what he meant to her. She loved him beyond measure.Im not sure, she replied, reaching for his hand.You dont have to go, he said, nuzzling her forehead with his own. Ill stay here with you.Gamely, she shook her head and smiled at him. He cradled her chin with one hand and gave her a kiss that still curled her toes.Ill be all right, she conceded, looking apprehensively at the towering structure.While they walked down the woodland path to the haunted house, she shared with him the last gooey bites of buttery caramel, luxuriously wrapped around a crisp Granny Smith apple. In turn, he fed her large chunks of funnel cake, topped with whipped cream and a caramel drizzle.Dusk fell swiftly.She sensed shadowy figures on the fringes of the fallow field from the corner of her eye; whether they brought her good cheer or meant her harm was indeterminate. She had a fairly good idea what was going to happen in the haunted house, but there was enough uncertainty to slow her step.Her boyfriend stopped up short and looked directly into her eyes. ""Look. We dont have to go. We can ride the Ferris wheel or the Tilt-A-Whirl.I to go, she said, fooling neither of them. Okay, well go he replied. And Ill be right by you. You trust me?I do, she said. But what if someone or something pops out of the wall and I pee myself?Is that likely?And what if I get scared and poop my pants?Is THAT likely? I mean, we can stop at the bathroom if you need toUgh! Im being ridiculous. Lets just go.Warm and reassuring in the late October chill, his strong arm encircled both of her thin shoulders.Hey. Remember. If you get scared? Keep your eyes on me, he said.She nodded. That would be easy to do. Ever since she first saw him in elementary school, she thought he was the most beautiful boy in the whole world. Little had changed since.Now settled on the matter, there was just the path forward.There was no turning back.  As they approached the attraction, he held her hand as they climbed the endless staircase to the top of the old mill, converted each fall into the popular horror show. She could hear screamsimmediately followed by loud laughterfrom both inside the mill and all around the Howl-O-Scream grounds.A vampire with bleeding eyeballs motioned them to the entrance. A crowd expectantly waited, only a few sent in at a time.Does anyone have any cold medicine? Im coffin too much, the vampire joked.Her boyfriend snickered. She stood stone faced.Maybe some fruit? I just love neck-tarinesThe crowd chuckled good naturedly as it moved forward.Im a bad artist, the vampire continued. I can only drawblood.This time, she joined her boyfriend in giggling at the bad puns.  Five minutes later, she had dug her fingernails into her boyfriends arm.No! No! NO! she shrieked, when they walked into the Mad Doctors Operating Room. The deranged patient lay supine on the surgical table, hacking off his own leg with a hatchet. Gouts of fake blood spewed everywhere. A ditzy nurse with a knife in her back gleefully mopped the floor.Hes chopping his leg! Hes chopping his leg! his girlfriend repeated over and over, each time more shrill.Hey, its just an animal bone. Not a femur, I promise, her boyfriend explained. See? His real leg is tucked underneath the table.The next room was worse: the medieval torture chamber. A girl about her age was lashed to a rack, writhing in pain as a masked man ratcheted the wheel. A little farther down, another young girl was displayed, impaled in a solid iron cabinet with a hinged front and spike-covered interior.Behold, the maiden in the Iron Maiden! announced her tormentor. He threw a bucket full of clear liquid that had the word ACID emblazoned on the front.Oh my god! she howled, when they entered the Inferno, devils dancing in a demonic disco, all decorated in Day-Glo paint, illuminated by the black lights.Her boyfriend just put his arm more tightly around her.After a few more terrifying rooms, they finally exited the mill into an empty clearing. After the hay bale maze, all they had to do was to walk to the end of the lane where their friends awaited, no doubt drinking hot chocolate around a bonfire.But the lane was lined with large oak trees, the perfect jump-scare alley.Were almost through, okay?Okay, she said, blinking back hot tears.They walked arm in arm.In a flash, a werewolf loped over to them, long white fake fangs bared.GAH! she screeched, dissolving into a gibbering mess, faced pressed into his shoulder.Look, Wolfman. Fuck off, okay?Mwahahaha the wolf man laughed menacingly, returning to the woods.And you, he said to his girlfriend. What an inadequate word to call the love of his life. He would take her to prom. . Keep your eyes on me, okay?But what ifHe looked sternly at her.But what if she repeated.But what ifyou give me this dance? he said, fumbling with his iPhone, queuing up their favorite song. The first twangy chords of her parents wedding dance soothed her immediately. By the time Anne Murray crooned her country ballad, her boyfriend had taken her into his arms, faux-waltzing her through one horror after another.A mummy staggered over, muttering ancient curses, but she was lost in her boyfriends eyes.Frankenstein and his bride attempted to stop their progress, but he tucked a lock of hair behind her ear.While Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees stood with dripping knives high overhead, even they paused to see the lovely young couple, enraptured, slow dancing down a lane of mayhem.By the end of their dance, all the creatures and monsters and villains had come from the edges, applauding as a couple finished their dance, turning a night of tricks and treats into a veritable Valentines Day."
"""Two People Sitting in a movie theater, waiting for the lights to come back on","Should I say something?She is so gorgeous, and I did have my eyes on her.She has lovely eyes too soft and looks kind.What are the chances she is sitting two chairs from me!But this is a movie theater  I just cant go over to her  in the semi darkness at that.And  she is by herself.I wonder why though.Sigh  what to do.The lights are out.Perfect reason to introduce myself and have a little chit chat.I have wanted to see this block buster for sometime and here I am finally.Oh man the reviews  fantastic.I just know an award or two is in the works.I wonder what her name is.I love her dress too  yellow suits her.I should go say something.If I go, will she be welcoming?Scary to say the least  for both of us.And what if she is open?That would mean talking  I just cant introduce myself and leave it at that.I was so looking forward to watching this movie alone with no chatter from my friends, to destress from the hectic week.Then again it may be worth it  she is gorgeous, so poised and relaxed.Goodness!She is not looking at her phone or texting!Very admirable.I really should say something to her.But I dont want her to think I am a creep or something.It is so frustrating that in todays world a man has to think twice before trying to start a conversation with a beautiful woman in a semi dark theater.Wait, is she looking at me?I will be damned!

And so it continued  chatting away as if they were long lost friends.Both, at various times, chastised themselves for wasting precious time that the non lights provided.They spoke of the excitement, the wonderment, mystery of movies and the actors who inhabit them.They dissected each others favorite movies.They delved into each others favorite actors.Then the topic of award shows came up.I cant believe we are talking about award shows  they thought.But it feels so natural. The lights came back on. Are they disappointed? Only slightly - they want to see the movie. Are they happy? Oh sure! There is the chemistry and the promise to come. Thank goodness for lights out at movie theaters. How lovely. And those friends? Wait until they hear this adventure - surely it is an adventure! How will they react? Happy to be sure. Slightly envious - oh yes. Thank goodness for movies and actors.  And sunny yellow dresses.  And of course movie lovers."
An Unvoiced Biography,"She hurled me into the truck. I thought that it was time for me to assume another duty but the decaying and putrid odour was an eye-opener. I looked around and saw that I was surrounded by rotten vegetables, discarded meat, diapers, plastic and whatnot. Reality struck me like a lightning and my misconception was gone with the wind. I was in a trash truck and was soon going to rot in a dump.  One look at my stained and disfigured self and anyone would concur that the dump was the right place for me. But I wasn't always like this. I was born more than a decade back when a local artisan took those lovely, fluffy cotton balls in his hands and had spun, spooled, warped and knit them into cloth.  I was then sent to a finishing mill. I was bleached and mercerised. I shone in full glory and was capable of being dyed. A woman probably in her mid-thirties had bought me for a few pennies. She was my mistress. I was elated that I finally had a home to call my own. My mistress folded me and placed me inside a cabinet. She had eventually forgotten about me. I lay in the nook of the cabinet, with every fibre in my being feeling stifled. Holding onto the hope that one day, I would be put to use, I spent the days and nights in frightening solitude. There was always light at the end of the tunnel. On an ordinary and uneventful morning, she took me out of the cabinet. I noticed that she was surrounded by needles and threads of different colours. My dream was about to come true. She sat comfortably on a chair on the porch. I fluttered in the cool breeze. I took a deep breath and allowed the beautiful feeling, the feeling of being useful to someone sink in. Suddenly, I felt a prick in my skin. I flinched. She tightened her grasp on me and prevented me from falling. She secured me in an embroidery hoop and gave me another prick. I didn't flinch. I got used to the prick. She carefully designed a garden with flowers and butterflies.  She ran her hand over me and I revelled in her endearing touch. As I stared at my reflection in an ornate mirror, I almost jumped in joy. I felt that I was enchanting. I was happy and thankful for all the pain for no pain no gain. Isn't it?  She folded me with great precision and placed me inside her handbag. I was her newfound companion and was on cloud nine. Suddenly, there was a jolt and I had begun to rattle and shake. I imagined that I was on a car ride. I was given a design and now a joy ride. I was on a roll. But my happiness didn't last long. My mistress took me out of her handbag and handed me to a man. The happy bubble in which I dwelled was punctured. She signed on a piece of paper and without looking at me even once, she left. I thought that she was gone forever. The man dumped me among a pile of other clothes that he hoarded.  I got used to being unproductive. I hated it but I had no option. On an uneventful morning, he grabbed me and threw me on a table. I flinched and shuddered. My lips moved in silent prayer. Suddenly, he ran scissors across me. Was he going to tear me into bits and pieces? Was I about to be discarded? Where was my mistress? Wasn't it her duty to protect me? A million thoughts ran hither thither in my mind.  He ran a few stitches across me, here and there and placed me in a polythene bag. My eyes yearned to get a glimpse of my new look but were of no avail.  I'm not confident about this but probably after a day or two, I felt as though I was being lifted. I was removed from the bag and blinded by the bright light, I squinted. I was used to the darkness and the light felt like a foe.  What I saw surprised me. A little girl donned me. I was transformed from simple cotton cloth to a beautiful frock. My eyes fell on my mistress. She was looking at the little girl in admiration. Love oozed out of her eyes. That little girl was her daughter.  I was her favourite possession. She had worn me on several important occasions like her friend's birthday party, Thanksgiving Day, and Sports Day. I felt that I was important. I felt worthy. I liked being cared for and attended to.  But all good things come to an end and so did our companionship. The little girl was not little anymore. She had outgrown me. It was time to bid adieu to the beautiful family. But my mistress, that benevolent soul, never ceased to surprise me. Scissors were run over me one more time but I wasn't afraid anymore. I had begun to trust her. She spread me on a table. I was transformed into a tablecloth. My form and duties didn't matter to me as long as I was under her canopy of care.  I was soiled all the time. She never put me for a wash in the washing machine. She soaked me in cold water and gently washed me with her hands. She carefully removed all the dirt and grime and I shone like a new cloth. I loved her and was thankful to her. If not for her I would have been a simple piece of cotton cloth.  A few years passed. Her hair greyed and my fibres were worn out. She gave me a new role. The role of a tea coaster. I happily adapted to my new form. As days passed, I had become less functional. I was a liability. A liability that anyone would want to get rid of. Ignoring my dilapidated state, she used me like a duster. She wiped every piece of furniture, door and window using me. I wasn't excited about my new role. The dust and mite irked my skin. I was bruised all over. Eventually, I was coerced to assume a new role. The role of a mop. She used me to clean the countertop. The oil and spices made me feel nauseated.  She no longer washed me with her hands. I churned in the washing machine in the company of other clothes. I was not special to her. Not anymore.  After getting enough out of me, she finally hurled me into the trash truck. I wish she had given me a little space in her home and her heart. I wish she had not discarded me like a piece of filth.  The hopper opened and I flew in the air only to land in the dump. I looked around and noticed that many pieces of clothes were lying around. Maybe it always came to this. This is how we have been treated for aeons.  I closed my eyes and waited to disintegrate. Albeit her discarding me was not of good taste, I owed my life to her. I have had my share of good and bad memories. But I wish to cling to the good memories. With that thought, I said sayonara to the world and was transported to another world, ready to take a rebirth."
The Ninth Morning,"My morning started with me lying facedown on the floor. The hardwood was cool against my cheek. It would have almost felt nice, if it wasn't because my wrist was throbbing in pain from breaking the fall from my bed. It took me a few minutes to gather my bearings. My alarm hadn't gone off yet. The light coming through my window was the pale light of the really early morning hours. I pushed myself up with my good hand, ready to climb right back into bed, but stopped when I looked down and saw what I was wearing. My cotton pajamas had been replaced by layers and layers of... Silk? No. The fabric felt too soft and airy, though it did have a shine to it that resembled silk well enough. The texture was so pleasant that I could sleep in it as comfortably as I could in my pajamas, but this outfit was no oversized t-shirt. I scrambled to my feet, drowsiness and pain evaporating away in the face of curiosity. Standing up, I looked down at a long white dress that seemed ripped out of a fairy tale. The skirt flared wide, like that of old-timey ballroom gowns. It looked like it should have been heavy, but the fabric was so light that even the numerous layers practically floated around my legs. The bodice had the look of a corset, flush against my skin, but it was far from restrictive. There were no wires or laces. The thin fabric clung to my chest and waist as if by magic. The bodice and skirt were embellished with flowers -not floral prints or even embroideries. There were dozens of actual daisies, poppies, bluebells, dandelions, iris and even orchids. The flowers' colors were bright and the petals unblemished. I plucked one coral-pink orchid to examine it up close. There were little dew drops on the petals, and a delicate sweet scent rose from the flower. I looked at my bed next: the sheets were tousled and wrinkled, like they were every morning. I plopped down on the bed in a flurry of skirts and petals. I stared at the blank wall.I regretted the fact that I had no mirror. I hadn't had time to buy one yet for the new house.I didn't plan on buying anything new until I finished unpacking boxes- and I wasn't even halfway done with that. I had felt out of place in the house before. There were no decorations, my bed and an old sofa were the all the furniture I had, and most of my belongings were stuffed into unlabeled boxes and the occasional garbage bag. But this was the first time that I felt out place and out of time. I sat in a daze for so long that the light streaming through the window grew bright and hot. There were birds singing outside, loud enough to be annoying. I turned to look toward the window. It was open. I finally stood up and walked around the bed, to the opposite wall where the open window offered a clear view of the trees outside. I remembered closing that window last night. It was a French style window, so its panels swung out wide. I shut it to avoid bugs flying into the room, or worse. Part of the house's charm was that it had several acres of woods out back. As much as I loved that, I did not want to wake up and find that a fox had climbed in through the window. Could a flowery gown have flown in through the window? Maybe a performer lived nearby and was drying laundry? I supposed I could have put on the dress in my sleep. I tried to remember what I had been dreaming about before falling off the bed. I could't recall any images, but I did get the vague memory of feeling nervous, or anxious maybe. It was the sensation of my heart beating fast in my chest. I could have spent all day pondering how I came to be wearing the dress, but I was forced to put those thoughts to rest when my phone's alarm jarred me back to the present. I took off the dress, leaving piles of flower petals on the floor in the process, folded it up as nicely as I could and shoved it in a mostly empty closet. I all but forgot about the whole thing for the rest of the day. The weirdness of it all seemed to fade in the mundanity of a day spent in an office, typing emails and making phone calls. That night, however, I made sure to shut the window properly before going to bed. I woke up in a dress the next morning.It was a different dress, though it was made of the same soft fabric, and covered in flowers as well. This one was an apricot color, and most of the flowers were pink thistle. Before I spent too long examining this dress, I shut my eyes and tried to remember what I had been dreaming about. Again, I remembered a sensation more than anything else: a nervous excitement. I grasped at the feeling, trying to return to its source. I got an image  a glimpse really- of stars, twinkling in the gaps between leaves on twisting branches. Try as I might, that was as far as I got in my memory. I looked toward the window, and found it open yet again. The day that followed was as uneventful as the day before, but I did not forget the strangeness of the morning as easily. I couldnt dismiss the event as easily now that it had happened twice. On the third morning, I woke up in a periwinkle dress, covered in blue flowers. I recalled starlight, and a smell like rain on leaves. The window, that I had shut the night before, was open.On the fourth evening, the open window was no longer a surprise. I hadnt bothered to close it at all. The dress was pink and the flowers purple.I had dreamt of moist earth, and a memory of a sound; a flute, I thought, or some other wind instrument. Another four nights passed. Three new dresses graced me each morning. The hardwood floors in my room were covered in a rainbow of flower petals and my closet was half full with extravagant gowns. The flowers never seemed to wilt: even the first dress looked as fresh as it had when I first wore it. I was ready to fall asleep and wake up dressed in flowers by the ninth night, but something changed then. I didnt fall asleep. I was wide awake when they came through my window. I heard the sound of rustling leaves first, then tapping on the window glass. I tossed off my blanket and got up, looking down to confirm that I was still wearing pajamas, before going to the window. There were three visitors outside, easily visible in the bright moonlight: a fox, a deer, and a bear. They all looked right at me, eyes bright. The bear, who was the largest and fluffiest of the three, was on all fours. Something pale rested on his back, in stark contrast to the dark fur. It was a dress. This one was a pale silver-blue; the color mimicked the moon's glow so well that it almost seemed made up of moonlight. The flowers on it were violet, blue, and white.The fox began to pace around the bear's front paws, looking at me expectantly. The deer bobbed its head at me. I felt my heart begin to beat more quickly, but I didn't feel nervous or afraid (despite the very large bear outside my window). I was excited. I grabbed the sides of the window frame and pulled myself up and through.I hopped outside, feet landing lightly on cool grass. The spring air was pleasantly cool.I stood hesitantly, until the deer gently nudged me toward the bear. The bear lowered his head reverently as I approached and grabbed the dress. I slipped out of my pajamas and into the gown, which fit as perfectly as all the others had. As soon as I was dressed, my three visitors turned around and started walking toward the line of trees. I followed them into the forest. The skirt reached to my ankles in front and trailed longer in the back. The fabric moved like mist over grass and roots, never getting caught or feeling like it dragged against the ground. Moonbeams pierced the canopy of leaves above us, painting the path silver. I didn't know what path we were following, but I walked with a sure step. I hadn't had a chance to explore these woods during the day, but the trail felt familiar. The smell of wet bark, the rustling leaves and the soft fabric of the dress caressing my skin, struck me with a feeling of djvu so strong it made my eyes water. The memories of my dreams from the past eight nights came forth just beneath the surface of recollection: it felt like they were contained in a rising bubble, a mere touch away from bursting and releasing everything.The bear, deer, and fox led me to a clearing among the trees. I passed underneath a pair of bent trees whose branches had entwined in such a way that they formed a wooden threshold. I stepped through it and arrived at a magical feast. The moment I crossed the threshold, the bubble burst and my memories came flooding back. I was in a wide field covered in flowers. I recognized some of the flowers: they had adorned my dresses for the past nine days. The field was brightly lit. The trees on the field were spaced apart, so the moon and stars glowed here without much interruption, but that wasnt the only reason it was so bright. Spheres made of glass hung on long strings attached to the trees branches. Inside each glass, a golden light twinkled: like a hundred miniature suns. There were two long tables set on either side of the field. A banquet of fruit and cakes decorated the tables among flowers scattered on the golden mantels. There were fine glass goblets set on the table. Though no one stood by them, the goblets were all full with a shimmering liquid that I couldnt have identified. The breathtakingly beautiful display was fit for a royal feast. And yet, all of it paled in comparison to the one other person who stood in the field. He stood directly across me, dressed in a coat and tails that appeared to me made of the same, airy fabric as my dress. No flowers decorated his suit, but the silvery blue fabric shimmered -practically glowed- as if it was covered in minuscule crystals that caught the light and reflected it back with every movement. His hair was long and silver, his face smooth and the features sharp. He was smiling, the way a little boy would smile if he had gotten away with something. Mischievous. My heart thrummed like a hummingbird. I had been coming to this feast night after night. I had met that creature every night. I had danced with him, my feet bare and my dresses flowing around me as we twirled over the wildflowers. He had held my hand in his, had held me by the waist and whispered in my ear. He stepped toward me. He stopped when he was close enough that I could see his eyes: like opals, iridescent hues twinkling. Just as he had every night before now, he held a hand toward me. I obliged by taking it and letting him place a feather-light kiss on fingers. His smile widened. And, just as he had every night, he asked me to dance. Again, I said yes. I never knew where it came from, but music filled the air. He led me in a dance I had never learned, but somehow I never missed a step. He spun me and pulled me close, my dress floating gracefully in a dance almost its own. Hours could have gone by- I wasnt counting. Not tonight, or any of the nights before it. I could have happily kept going, dancing until dawn, but we always stopped before morning came. He let go of my waist, but held onto my hand, bringing it up to his lips for one more kiss. He looked at me, and I knew what he was going to ask. He would ask the same thing he asked every night. Will you stay? Every night, I had answered the same thing. Every night, I had crossed the threshold that led back to my house. I would wake up with nothing but a dress, and a faded dream. Every night, I had told him no. Tonight, I leaned forward and gave him a kiss. On the ninth night, I chose to stay."
Always and Never,"Sensitive: sexualized language, and cursing.  Three years ago today, it was a Mothers Day Sunday.There is an anniversary picture on my cell phone of my infant daughter sitting in my ex- husband's lap. The memory holds a story of spouses, out to dinner, with two beautiful children. In the picture, her Father looks blankly beyond the camera, with no affect in his face; the musicians must have been in that direction because my infant daughter is also gazing in the same direction (and there is a rational voice inside me that knows certainly they are not BOTH avoiding my gaze). The memory holds that he had a double jack-and-coke; the picture shows it was half gone before we were seated. The memory holds the same absence of enthusiasm for the rest of the meal.I can recall making an intention to verbalize gratitude and enthusiasm to engage my family and incite joy in the children, Oh my goodness look at all these cakes! Sweetheart would you like a cake with Mommy?Two months later, it was a Tuesday morning, before leaving for work, on a bright orange morning of summer, when I threatened him with an exasperatedYoull wake up alone one day if youre not careful!When he replied Good! I decided aloud Todays the day!Since then, I have thought a lot about being alone. At the time it had felt like such a worthy curse to consequence him with, after all the things I hadfelt I had coped with doing alone in our love together. After I left him, I often felt panicked that NOW... no one would know the real me! A faulty assumption that a. he ever knew"" me in the way I had romanticized and b. that somehow the internal world I romanticized my whole life could somehow be understood by any willing party living outside of it. I despise the exclusionary elitism of the phraseyou have to be good at being alone before you can be with someone else. I have been good at being alone my whole life; as a child, as a married partner, and now as a free mother in the world. I tendedto siblings and smoked cigarettes alone as a teenager, then listened to music, did my nails, and painted in oilsand wrote in black leather-bound journals, alone.I occupied myself with house cleaning, making dinner, tending to babies, working out with punk music and pink legging sets, going to bed reading books and drinking tea as a loving wife, alone. As a free Mother I shopped, went to movies, tended to plants, ateramen, and watched Sci- fi alone very well. I cry, steam, sing, dance, scream and cum alone in the light of day or the dark; my solitary resume is complete. Despite these skill sets my heart does desire sharing these things, in the morning and at night, with someone curious enough to learn my romantic internal world. Even all the spiritual teachers I would listen to would deny the necessity to train oneself around the truth of their hearts, as vines around a scaffold. Then a shift started several months ago, where I could embrace answering my own desires intentionally. It was then I realized I had been doing this for several years, simply out of necessity rather than the choice. Making the intentional choice to attend to my alone-ness was, yes, novel, I will admit that here. In doing so I discovered many voices to be heard inside me; yes, the famed little me (the one living in all of us -I dare you an evening alone with a nostalgic food and movie pairing), a hero animal (mine a large oil-breathing and red eyed dragon, now often sleeping), a wise minded (handsome, tall, dark werewolf of the screen) figure of Jesus to guide me, and finally my pensive perished Great Aunt watching me peacefully from her seat inside the wooden box of silver flatware she gave me after my son was born. Weeks went by and I kept this audience company as I navigated my new life, feeling supported by my own personal universe and kept by closest friends. I felt, always holding this group of voices inside me, their drinks spilling as I breathed and fretted about outside their waiting room in my chest. Several weeks went by peacefully in this fashion, petting the dragons head and watching the child color pictures and practice meditation, her tiny hands folding obedient at our heart. Jesus hand resting on my heart and my Great Aunt watching down on me (which is strange to visualize from inside me) with tranquil approval. Those several weeks passed and finally, I was not anxious about my daily life of living alone as I laughed in the out-and-about with my family of voices inside me. I was engaged and attentive to my daily and fluctuating needs, so much so that soon, all the voices dissipated. Naturally it is objective to report that also, I think I performed much better overall in my few external relationships as well (she says thoughtfully scratching her chin and looking up above her shoulder). At first, when I noticed the quiet, I had assumed that since I had grown attentive to my needs, the childish personification of my moral compass, my immature defense mechanisms, all of that had dissipated away into a more mature and whole conceptualization of my being. I was so pleased with my newfound maturity. Suddenly, on a Sunday afternoon, after picking up the groceries and just before piling up the laundry, I became awash with cold, white dread. This voice has not allowed me rest, no matter what reframe or wise Aunty I compel to soothe my fear. I have quietly pondered this truth for 24 hours. I realized that when I was married, or now that I am a free mother, when I am surrounded by people or here in the dark, I am alone with my experience. No one will understand my experience of magical animals and strong Jesus except through my voice and the magic I give them. All the people I see as connected on coffee dates or in dancing poses are still just two people sharing their alone; they have actively tailored their form for the purpose of faade that there is an elevated state beyond the truth I have frightfully realized. My maturity and I waited for the understanding of this sad knowledge to grow into something else. Neither handsome Jesus nor little me came forward with any answers, and the red eyed dragon remained asleep. I continued behaving the way I always do, except, with the knowledge that I would not be fighting against the truth today. I knew, I would always be alone, but secondly, and more importantly, there was liberation at the bottom of this terrifying well, dammit and I would stay present in this fated disillusionment until I came out the other side. I did my days work under this cloudy consciousness and sought out no one. I heard a line while I was folding laundry (if you are folding and putting away all your laundry in the same day there is something  wrong with even you, my friend; leave this reading knowing that even you have still room to elevate to a freedom in which your unicorn of empty hampers is a myth... liberate yourself from the toil of laundry!) that stated something to the effect of suggesting that, if I am trying to fill the never  ending hole, I am probably missing something in the that moment of vital importance to that hole. I put the tee shirt down and look up at the reflection of myself across my bedroom; I hear my daughter listening to cartoons in the living room. I goout to join her on the couch; she looks over at me and rests her head into my chest crawling under my free arm, the same fluid movement she has done for the past 3 years whenever we are together in front of a television. We sit this way for twenty-four minutes; I pat her belly and squeeze the soles of her feet gently. I quietly tell her Its time to brush teeth for bed, baby. She responds with a squeal and a cry Come here I whisper, empathic sadness in my upturned mouth for her desperate tears. I hold and rock her as I tell her Its alright- we will watch it again tomorrow. I rock her in the fashion I did when she was newborn, on my lap now, her heart against mine, and I hum the same song twinkle twinkle little star. My memory holds so much time that first year, alone with her, us together, in the middle of the night, humming that song from a muscle memory in exhaustion rocking in our recliner chair. I tell her tonight I used to sing you this song when you were a baby. I do not tell her, that I chose that song, because when I tried to sing to her You are my sunshine, I would cry, every time, until choking on my very breath, at the flippant lyrics suggesting I could ever lose her now that I had her in my arms. I tell her, Do you remember that I live in your heart?Yes Mommy.Do you remember that you live in my heart?Yes Mommy. A rehearsed magical thought I first taught to her older brother, eight years earlier, still also a part of his foundations of cognitions about our relationship. She lowers her gaze and rests her tearful cheek against my tee shirt, her runny nose rubbed dry in a long swipe on the black cotton.I do not tell her tonight that it was our solitary moments in wee witching hours in that leather recliner that grew the red- eyed dragon frommy rib sinews and my boiling flesh, that would eventually carry us to our new life, where she and I could cry, scream, and sing all alone in the night, the strong hand of Jesus and all the universe to support us, Amen."
Daddy's Chair,"Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Rana, and she lived on a farm. Her family was made of a dad, a mom, six brothers, eleven cows (Bessie died last fall), two dogs, and three cats.This day started off quite ordinary. Her brothers were milking the cows.Rana took her little bucket and walked carefully to the first milking stall. Annabelle, the biggest cow, looked at her with big, solemn eyes. Randy, her brother who was leaning against the cows side with his hands working the teats, looked at her with sleepy eyes. Go ask one of the other boys today.But they dont give me enough. My kitties are thirsty all day then.Randy sighed. Hold your bucket closer.She obeyed, and he filled it almost to the top. My kitties will say thank you, Randy. He mumbled something. She held the bucket with both hands and walked to the corner of the barn. Taffy, Shaggy, and Ruffles came to her right away, and she petted them while they drank their milk. When they were done, the boys were done milking, and everyone went inside for breakfast.Mama asked the same question every morning. What are you guys doing today?Randy said he and Rey were going to work on the treehouse. Ricardo was going to draw pictures of all the birds he could find. Rowan, Rudy, and Ryan were going to go fishing. Rana wasnt sure.Do you want to come grocery shopping with me?Rana shook her head. Maybe Ill go fishing too.Rudy protested. You always splash around and scare the fish away.No need for loud voices at the breakfast table. Daddy didnt like arguments. I noticed a weak spot in the fence this morning, so the cows have to stay inside today. Im going to walk the fence and see how much lumber I need to get. Well need all hands on deck tomorrow for repairs.Later that morning, Rana found herself walking down a deer path through the woods. She could hear the creek to her left. She followed the path until the trees opened up to a meadow. She could see the creek now, bubbling happily into the pond. Ripples made the reflected sky look magical, and she smiled.There were a lot of sweet williams blooming at the tree line. She picked a handful and brought them to the ponds edge. She picked off the individual flowers, put them gently into the water, and watched them dance on the ripples.Farther away, the pond was as smooth as glass. She could see the boys across there, sitting on the bank with their lines in the water. She watched Rowan get up and hand his pole to Ryan.Rowan made his way to a big maple tree that grew close to the pond. He jumped for the lowest branch and caught it on his first try. Rana watched as he pulled himself up and wiggled along a big branch that hung over the water. He motioned for Ryan to hand him back his pole.Ryan held on to the tree trunk and leaned out with the pole. Rowan bent from his branch and reached. He grabbed the pole, lost his balance, and pulled Ryan into the pond with him.They made a wonderful splash. Their big ripples came all the way across the pond and fought with the little creek ripples. Rana giggled as they climbed out, dripping wet and shivering, and Rudy groaned about for sure not catching any fish now.All four made their way back to the house. Rudy cleaned up the poles while Rana ran inside for dry clothes. She came back and threw them into the barn, where Rowan and Ryan were changing.What do we do with our wet stuff? Rowan wrung out his tshirt. Mama wouldnt want it in the house.Ryan shook out his hair like a dog. We can hang them up in Bessie's stall.But its so humid.What if we turned on that little heater? Just until our clothes are dry.This course of action was adopted, and the extension cord was run to Bessies stall for the little heater. The boys left to see how the tree house was coming along, and Rana climbed up to the loft to find her cats.She dug a little nest in the hay and waited. Soon Taffy and Shaggy were purring happily as she scratched around their ears. Ruffles curled up beside her and fell asleep.A weird sound came from down below; like popcorn, almost. Rana frowned and stood up, sending the two cats away. She walked to the ladder. Boys? Are you down there? She caught a whiff of air that smelled like winter: woodsmoke.The cats followed Rana as she clambered down the ladder into a haze of smoke. Annabelle and Clara were shifting nervously on either side of the empty stall. Rana could see tongues of fire licking up the straw around the heater. She unplugged the extension cord, then ran for her little bucket and filled it up at the water trough. She sloshed it over the heater, but the fire was spreading fast through the hay. She dropped the bucket.Rana ran for the big door and threw her weight against it. She pushed it all the way open, then grabbed the morning bell and rang it twice, the same way Randy always did when they were finished milking. The cows stirred and started backing from their stalls, but the fire had reached the wall and was racing up it.Barking caught her attention as Guardian and Lassie dashed past her into the barn. They pushed the cows, nipping at their legs. Rana watched in relief as the cows exited the barn one by one until Lizbeth was out and the barn was empty. The whole ceiling was on fire now.Rana sent the dogs, and thereby the cows, to the other end of the pasture. Then Mama got home from grocery shopping, and she got scolded for standing so close to the barn. It was all burning now.The boys came running, and Daddy came up from the field. Everyone wanted to know what happened, but Rana was busy coughing. The barn turned into a pile of ashes.Evening came. Daddy and the boys set up a makeshift fence to keep the cows from getting too close to the scene of the fire. They did the milking into extra pails from the garage. Rana got a container from Mama to give milk to her cats, but only Taffy and Shaggy came running.Rana suddenly remembered Ruffles, curled up in the hayloft. She burst into tears and ran into the kitchen. Mama let her cry until the boys were washed up, then dried her tears and led her to the table.They prayed. I dont want to eat.I want you to eat a little bit, at least. Do you want to tell us what happened first?She told the whole story, but broke down when she got to the end with poor Ruffles. Daddy looked at her very seriously before getting up out of his chair.Rana, I want you to switch spots with me.She halted mid-sniff. What?This spot is for the protector of the family. You did a lot of protecting today. Your quick thinking saved all the cows, and two of the cats.But RufflesRana, he pulled back her chair and gave her a hug. You did everything you could. Im proud of you. Go sit in my chair.She felt very small in Daddys chair. The boys all looked like they wished they had been at the fire. Rana wished they would have been there, too. Maybe they couldve saved Ruffles.But Daddy was proud of her. She wiped her nose and sat a little straighter. Maybe she could eat some supper after all."

One To Three,"I have good news and bad news. Which do you want first? Choices were usually for other people. Destiny didnt choose to feel run down or to be limited to medical care at the free clinic. She didnt choose to wait three hours just to be seen by whichever doctor was next in line, but at least she had this choice.Whats the bad news?Experience had taught Destiny that the bad news was typically far worse than the good news was good. Her choice, therefore, was determined by a primal need for self-preservation.""The good news, the doctor began, ignoring her, is youre not sick. In fact, youre as healthy as a horse.Then why do I feel like I just ran six furlongs?Huh? The doctor asked, looking up from his notes.It was a joke. You said a horse. Furlong? Oh never mind, whats the bad news, doctor? Dont leave me hanging.Youre pregnant, dear. Im guessing about two months along.Im gonna have a baby! Destiny blurted out. It would be later in the day before she realized the doctor implied her being pregnant was bad news.Yes, I'm afraid so. Ive arranged for you to meet with a family counselor. You do have options.Options? Destiny raised one eyebrow. What the heck do you mean by that?If you dont want the the doctor paused mid-sentence.I want the the, Destiny interrupted. I want my baby with all my heart.The rest of the appointment was a blur. Destiny had so much adrenaline running through her veins that she couldnt concentrate on what the doctor was saying. When he had finally given her the literature and prescriptions for prenatal vitamins, Destiny sprinted out of the office to the closest bus stop. She had some shopping to do.Walking up and down the aisles of the baby boutique, Destiny quickly realized how expensive children were, a fact crystalized when she overheard a salesclerk completing another customer's transaction.That will be $798.15.The customer, a well dressed young woman with perfect hair and nails, pulled out a Visa from her purse and inserted it into the credit card chip reader. The clerk and the customer chit-chatted about strollers and cribs and bassinets, neither phased by the large total on the sales slip. Destiny paused and opened up her wallet which had just a SNAP card, a stick of gum, and four one-dollar bills. Dejected, Destiny turned to leave the store. On the way out, however, she spottedthe clearance rack.The mishmosh of garments was not inspiring to say the least. There were odd colored outfits and mismatched shoes, almost nothing worthy of a second look. Desperate yet determined Destiny discovered a lone light blue onesie with the word LOVE lettered in red on the front. It had been hidden behind a hooded parka with a ripped sleeve. Destiny thought to herself. The little outfit had been originally priced at $20.00, but had been reduced twice to $5.00. Destiny, commited to purchasing the adorable find, opened the change compartment in her wallet and poured out a handful of mostly bronze coins. As she started to count, she found a single quarter, four dimes, and three nickels. Without even counting the pennies, she grabbed the onesie and marched up to the counter.$5.25, please, the cashier announced, as she folded the outfit and placed it into a bag.I only have $4.92, Destiny answered, as she quickly counted out the pennies. I just found out today that Im pregnant.Its ok, maam, the cashier said with a wink. I forgot the friends and family discount, so that will be $4.92 exactly.In her life, Destiny had never been so grateful. For thirty-three cents, the cashier had bought Destiny dignity and the new mother-to-be would never forget the kindness.*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*I have good news and bad news.Listen very carefully, Eli. Im pregnant, perturbed, and I have to pee.  Are you sure you want to mess with me right now?Im sorry, baby doll, you know me. I joke. Its my way.Fine. Whats the bad news?My mom just calledshes on her way over.Destiny is coming? How is that bad news? I love your mother.You know how I feel. Shes always wearing that awful uniform. Cant she take five minutes to change before she barges in?? Are you ashamed of your mother?Well, no.That woman is a saint. She worked her ass off to put food on your table.I knowbut the uniformYou should love that uniform. She paid for your collegeas a waitress.ButBut nothingyour mom is on her way over. Thats the good news. Now go make some herbal tea.It didnt take long for Eli to make the tea or for his mother to make it to the house.Ill get it, Eli shouted when the doorbell broke the silence.Be nice, Melody yelled back, causing Eli to laugh out loud just as he opened the door.Hello, Elijah, Destiny said, wrapping her arms around her sons neck. In his whole life, Eli couldnt remember a single time that his mother failed to hug him the first time she saw him. He loved the attention as a boy, but, like most teenagers, he resisted it as he got older. On this day, however, he welcomed the display of affection. His wife had reminded him just how lucky he was, and he wanted his mom to know as well.Hi mom, he said as he stepped to the side, motioning her in. Its really nice to see you.Are you sure? Destiny responded with a wink. Should I have changed before I came over?No, mom, Eli answered, feeling a bit guilty, giving his mother an unexpected second hug.How is Melody? You arent annoying her, are you?A little.Thats what I thought. You be nice to that girl. She's been good for you and to you.Shes upstairs in bed, Mom, but I know shed love to see you.In a minute. First, I brought something I wanted you to have. Eli looked down and saw a perfectly wrapped gift in his mothers hands.Mom, you shouldnt have. I told you we have all we need.You dont have this, and Ive been waiting so long to give it to you. Destiny said, handing Eli the package.Should I open it now?Youd better, she answered with a smile.Eli found the seam and carefully tore off the blue bunny-covered wrapping paper. Inside was a plain white box, taped on all four sides. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small pen knife which he promptly used to cut the tape. Finally able to open the box, he pulled off the top, allowing him to see a small faded light blue onesie with the word LOVE printed in red on the front.Mom, I cant take this. Its important to you.The story of the onesie, the clerk, and the thirty-three cents was cherished family history and the outfit was Destinys most prized possession.When I was young, Destiny explained, this was my way of showing you I loved you. I bought it myself, and I gave it to you. Its time to give it to you again so you will always remember the only thing that is truly necessary to give your child is love. Please give it to your son. Will you do that for me?Of course I will, Eli answered, Lets go show Melody.*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*I have good news, dad.Whats that, kiddo? Eli asked, looking down at his son.Grandma isnt really dead. Wanna know how I know?I do, Ben, Eli responded, genuinely interested in what his five-year-old son was about to say.Well, my teacher, Mrs. Conroy, she told me that as long as we keep loving people, they never die. Thats true, isnt it dad?It sure is, champ. Mrs. Conroy knows what shes talking about.Then I want to do something for grandma. Is that alright?Well that depends, kiddo. What do you want to do?Wait, Ill show you. Thelittle boy answered, charging out of the room, only to return a moment later.I want to give her this, Ben said, holding up a little light blue outfit for Eli to see. L. O. V. E. That spells love. Grandma taught me the letters. Can I give it to her so she knows we love her then she won't really be dead?Ben, where did you get that?I found it in my closet. Grandma told me all about it.Of course, you can give it to her, Eli said, holding back tears. I think shed like that very much.There wasnt much talk on the way to the funeral home or during the service. Ben made sure to keep very quiet, waiting for the opportunity to give his grandmother her gift. When most of the crowd had left, Eli found Ben.Are you ready?Ready.Great, lets go.Taking his hand, Eli walked with Ben up to the casket where Destiny lay.She looks like shes sleeping. Ben observed, looking up at his father then back down at Destiny. I think she is smiling,I think so, too.I love you, Grandma, Ben said as he laid the small light blue onesie near Destinys heart. He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a quarter, a dime, and three pennies, laying the coins under his grandmothers hand. He whispered something Eli could not hear. Then the two turned around and walked out of the chapel.What did you tell Grandma? Eli asked.Its a secret, Ben answered, with a serious look on his round little face.Its okay, I promise I wont tell a soul.I told Grandma I was giving her thirty-three cents.Thirty-three cents?Yes, Dad. Just in case they dont have the friends and family discount in heaven."
In My Dreams,"They called my name from the black microphones in their hot hands. The crowd erupted in applause and cheers. The stage manager gave me a light nudge on my back, and I took one shaky, deep breath. I emerged from the shadowed wings into the spotlight, which created an intimate focus of attention on me, dressed in a green, sequined button up top, leather pants, and dress shoes too tight for my big toe to breathe.I could hear the whispered sounds of the crowd as they stared at me, in awe and admiration, and in judgment. My muscles relaxed, and I accepted the loneliness of the circular stage. My head tilted to the right and whipped to the left, and my entire body spun 360 degrees.Hit it, I shout into my wireless microphone, and the pre-recorded drum beats sound. The energy of the audience shifts when mine exudes for their enjoyment. Seven years of; disappointment, rejection, working exhausting shifts at fast food restaurants, performing gigs at weddings for cash that would only allow me to eat fast food, and writing, producing, and marketing myself for labels. Finally, my dreams are coming true in front of those who believed in my talent; my manager Tessa and best friend Kalif, and those who were waiting on my downfall; my family.My hit pop single, which is number 5 in  and sold 200,000 copies in one week, is now being performed for the first time, live, on stage, in front of millions of viewers watching the , and my adoring fans who came to support me.I ready my throat for the first verse of my song, .Wake up, wake yourself up baby. The sound is getting louder, and you cant be at peace. Boom boom. Boom boom. You try to sleep in your misery, but it eats you alive. Your ears are consumed with the deep vibrations, you cant survive. Boom boom. Boom boom. BoomMy eyes fly open to see my fraying floral wallpaper in the darkness of my tiny bedroom.I slip my feet into the warm slippers Kalif gifted me for my 35 birthday last year. I navigate through my low lit apartment, grabbing the grey jumper that hangs on my dining chair, and leave apartment #100 to berate a woman 15 years my senior.Denise isnt a bad person; shes one of my best tenants. Rent is always given to me on time; she often brings me Ukrainian food packaged in plastic containers when I dont have the energy to cook rice and chicken after teaching several lessons at my uncles music store, or dealing with building issues and inquires. She also supports my endeavors and passions for music, as she is the lead drummer for , a classic rock indie band.I have told her numerous times, she is only permitted to play her drums between 12pm and 5:30pm. If she wants to continue playing, she has to find another space out of apartment #101. But, for the past few days, I have been waking up to the same nuisance every night, .I dont understand why she doesnt want me to dream in peace. But I seem to be the only person bothered by the noise because I havent received any complaints from other tenants. But tonight, I am going to end this nonsense. I wonder if any landlords have ever filed for noise complaints against their own tenants before?I lightly tap her emerald green door, carefully listening for her footsteps on the other side. Her hair is wrapped in a silk scarf patterned with giant dead rodents, her bands infamous logo.Ikenna.Shes the only tenant that is on a first name basis with me.This is your first warning, Denise. Ive been hearing you play those drums of yours two nights in a row already. At first, I figured you just got carried away and would remember the rules and obey them, but if that were the case, I wouldnt be standing here in front of you.She yawns loudly and wipes saliva from her upper lip. Her eyes are narrow, trying to adjust to the light from the hallway behind me. Ive been sleeping since 10 oclock.Youre telling me you werent just playing the drums two minutes ago?Her face holds confusion and she shakes her head.Man, I think youve been working too hard. You need some rest.She waves for me to leave and slowly closes the door.There it goes again! my right hand applies enough pressure to push the heavy door back. Did you hear that?I peer over her shoulder into her kitchen, then to her cozy living room, and finally the wooden bedroom door that is wide open, revealing her messy bed.Its quiet as a mouse. Im sure everyone is asleep right now, which is what I think we should both do, she says agitatedly.Im sorry, Denise, I dont want to pry around your space at such an inappropriate time like this, but I have been hearing this  sound, and its driving me crazy. Can you please allow me to search your apartment?She rolls eyes, IkennaIt cant wait, Denise.I reflect my desperation into her tired eyes.Be quick. And just advising you, youre not going to find anything, because Im not playing any drums or music, and theres no one in here.I ignore her as the  continue to taunt me. I creep around the space like a lucrative robber, opening cupboards, peaking outside the open window that reveals a lonely alleyway. Only coming across cans of beans and soup arranged erratically, a bathroom with no faulty pipes, and the slight weeping sounds of the nightly wind. Ive checked this poor womans entire apartment, and still couldn't figure out the source of the noise.I head back towards the front door, My apologizes, Denise. Maybe Im going insane or something. Ill probably investigate the other apartments in the morning. Again, Im so sorry. Have a good night.Yeah, night.My feet stop in its tracks near a flimsy coat closet in the front entrance of her apartment.Its louder than before. Clearer even. I look to Denise and she stares back with no reaction, just a sleepy trance. I point to her closet and gesture that Im going to open it. Her loud exhale cant even be heard over the booming sounds that repeat in an aggressive manner. My shaky hands reach for the brass knobs, slowly turning them to the left. The dark, dusty state of the closet is a dead end. The sound is present, but all I see are coats and spiky sneakers or 8 inch heels. My head leans closer to into the closet, understanding of the ominous feeling flooding my senses.What is this noise and when will it end?You need to go back to your room, Ikenna, a voice says.You sound funny, Denise.I turn around to see Denise is no longer standing behind me with her arms crossed. She is sitting on her cream couch, and a man dressed in blue scrubs stands in the spot she previously stood in. His arms coax me into his grasp, and I lean into his body.I need to find the noise! I shout with rage.Kalif shushes me, I know, I know, but we need to get you back to your room now. You shouldnt have been able to leave your room this easily, you know.His brown beard scratches my cheek, and we walk in unison out of Denises apartment. She sits still on the couch, staring at nothing, never acknowledging us.Before I can digest the pity I feel for her, I am back in my bedroom. This time, there is a woman dressed in identical scrubs, strapping black Velcro bands around the bed poles and my wrists. The woman smiles at me and reaches over my head towards the antique shelf screwed on my wall. Her veiny hand comes back into my view, holding a transparent pill organizer. She opens a flap and shakes her head, her locks shaking by her forehead and pierced ears.I see you havent taken your meds yet. You cant be skipping on your pills, Ikenna. I know you dont like taking them, but its only for a little while. Until you get better. Its going to help you get the  out of your life and get you home to your family soon, Tessa explains calmly.She hands me a blood orange pill and a half empty water bottle. I ingest. Tessa is pleased and switches my bedside lamp off.My upper and lower limbs are strapped to the bed, I attempt to dream peacefully."
The Fishermen Song,"Have you ever spoken to the rain?She did. Shed lift her head up, gaze at the clouds, and listen closely.Listen. Shed say. Listen to the rain.I'd look up at the greying clouds but hear nothing. Because the rain never spoke to me. It only spoke to her. I wish I knew what it said. What secrets they shared. I always imagined it spoke in whispers. Something so beautiful. I remember the day we sat by the lake. The trees waltzed with the wind around us. Autumn leaves broke away and swayed in twirls towards the infinite. The smell of the earth was so pungent. So pure. I stole a glance at her, sitting beside me. Eyes reaching for the sky. Her soft, silky hair flew behind her. Drips of water fell on her nose, and it made her smile. As though the rain had just shared an inside joke.What did it say? I said at the time, still not getting anything.It said its happy were both here. Everybody else is leaving.I looked around, and realized it was true. The minute the clouds gathered, and the rain picked up; people started to leave. Families packed their lunches and headed for their cars, dragging their kids behind. An older couple snapped their umbrella open and wobbled to the parking lot, wrapped in a hug. The park stood almost empty, save for us and the bikes that drove us here.People dont like getting wet. I said.She giggled, allowing the beads of water to dribble from her chin. I know. Its weird, isnt it?The thunder didnt spook her. I watched it flash in the distance, roaring its dominance. But she never flinched. Not even a little. She said that the thunder, the clouds, and the rain are one. They complemented one another. Just like she and I. Just like everything around us. The earth, the sky, the wind, the animals, the trees. Humans. We all speak to one another. Connected by a celestial bridge.But what happens when things die? I had asked. Wouldnt that break the connection? The bridge, I mean.She shrugged. There is no death. You only move on to the next life. And then the next, and the next. It never ends. Life goes on.I didnt understand it at the time, and honestly, I didnt bother to inquire any further. I was satisfied with what she said. Whether it was true or not, I didnt care. I liked the sound of it. Life goes on. It sure seemed like it did.I remember she liked to sing. Shed make up some new songs and sing them to me on our way to school. She said the clouds helped her come up with the right words. She even proved it once. We were walking to school on a spring day when she stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and gazed up. I watched her fix her eyes on the skys languid movement. Silent. Everything around us was so silent. I feared that time had stopped. That wed be stuck here forever, and Id never hear her sing again. Then her lips moved, and she smiled.Look, She pointed a finger. They look like sailing ships. The blue sky is the ocean.I looked up, shielding my eyes from the glaring sun. Ships? I dont know, maybe.Theyre telling a story. About the fishermen at Black Bear Lake. Her light hair swooshed over her shoulders. She stayed still, like one of those porcelain figures my mom liked to buy from a local antique shop.What kind of story? I asked.She paused, then said. The normal kind. Fishermen came to the lake yesterday morning, opened their nets, and threw them into the waters. When the sun left, so did they.I didnt know how to feel about that. It sounded a little. Boring. I said. Why would the clouds tell you that?She wasnt offended by it. She actually giggled. It doesnt have to be interesting to be beautiful. The fishermen were happy to be there. They loved the big puffy cloud because it gave them cool shade when it became too hot. Were all connected, remember?She later sang the song about the fishermen. The one that the clouds inspired her to sing. I cant remember much of the words today, but I remember it went something like this:. There were tides, seagulls, and ropes. I pictured the strings of sunlight hitting the ocean. The smell of salt and sweat. It stayed with me for days.Until one day, months from then, I heard that song again. I remember that day so vividly. Like it was yesterday. I heard that song on the radio. It was sung by a school choir. It wasnt exactly the same, but it was pretty close.. I couldnt believe it. How did they know the words? I rode my bike and raced to her house. I wanted to tell her about the radio song right away.She beamed, joyful. I told you! Its the bridge. Were all connected. They probably saw the ships in the clouds, or at least, one of them did.Whether I believed her or not, I didn't know. But these are stories that I will hold so dear. Even though still today, I havent been able to hear the whispers of the rain. Every now and then, I'd lift my head up to the clouds and watch the rain go down. The sound it makes as it hits the window. Drizzling on the tall metal pipe that almost touches the sidewalk. The splashing of water behind speeding tires. The blurred orange hue of streetlights, just before the sun tucks behind the horizon. Closing a lid on a darkened sky. I try to listen. Hopeful itll speak to me like it did to her. But it never did. It only spoke to her."
The Plant That Never Gave Up,"Out of curiosity Cecilia walked into the garden shop and trolled around. The air inside was remarkably cooler than the stifling outdoor summer heat and she felt refreshed as she walked among the ferns and the palms touching their surfaces and just enjoying the textures. Reaching a shelf of very angular straight leafed plants she hesitated and stared at them. She had never really seen these before and she found the clustered sharp tipped plants very intriguing. The leaves were a sharp green with a yellow outline and white mottling. Reaching out, she touched the large thin leaf, curious about its fleshy thickness and amazed by how rigid they were.	Thats a Snake plant. a soft voice from behind her said.	She quickly withdrew her hand and turned to face the voice. It was from a gentle, rounded man with a kind face who stood there smiling with his hands clasped tightly behind his back.	Why is it called that? She asked.	You can see, at the tip of the leaf blade, it narrows to a point like a snakes tongue.	Oh yes. she said. I see.	This is a wonderful specimen and the best part of it is, you cant kill it. Its impossible.he added.	She nodded slightly. Well, Ive never had a plant before. She thought for a second, twisting the ends of her red hair before deciding. Ok, Ill give it a try. and with a delicate motion, the shopkeeper took the plant she liked, wrapped it in tall brown paper to protect the sides and off she went.	She was pleased with herself as she took the plant home and set it on the sill at the west facing window. She had been depressed lately and had hoped this could brighten up her mood. She stood back and looked at it in the afternoon sun. It seemed to glow in a sunbeam as she crossed her arms and smiled. As she stood there, her yellow Labrador trotted over and sat next to her, trying to appreciate whatever she was appreciating. What do you think Ollie? Cecilia asked. Ollies only response was a nudge on her leg with his nose.	As if on cue, the doorbell to the apartment rang and Cecilia opened the door for Amanda, her best friend. Stepping into the apartment with a nod to Cecilia and carrying a canvas shopping bag full of groceries, Amanda walked through the apartment straight towards the kitchen, as the dog trailed behind her with a steady jog and a wagging tail. She placed the bag on the counter and it promptly collapsed, allowing a variety of fruits and vegetables to tumble out. Quickly, she snatched a tomato that was rolling off the edge and towards Ollie's curious jaws.	I am going to make you dinner tonight!! Amanda exclaimed with a flourishing wave of her hands. Since we are now in our late thirties and we can no longer handle our booze.	Uh, actually it was the hangovers that I am having trouble with. Cecilia corrected.	Whatever! Amanda retorted. I will instead intoxicate you with a Nicoise salad and a small glass of Chianti! Amanda grinned at her presentation and was pleased with Cecilias soft smile. Amanda held out her arms and approached her best friend. They hugged very tightly and the small silence was soothing. How are you doing? Amanda asked sincerely once they parted.	Cecilia nodded slightly. Im ok. The funeral was tough, but a lot of my dads friends were there, and my brother was there with his wife and three kids.	Have they been trained yet? Amanda asked.	They were nice, however, I think it was a small dose of Bendryl that may have played a part. With kids under three you can get away with that. Amanda resumed her station behind the center counter in the middle of the kitchen.	In my parents day, Amanda began as she took a knife out of the block. it was the whiskey rag. They said it was for teething, but I now appreciate its duplicity.	The kitchen wall was open to a large dining room with windows which faced the west, where the new plant had been placed. Amanda glanced into the dining room and spied the plant. Whats this? Did you buy a Sansevieria? she asked, pointing the knife loosely towards the new addition.	Its a Snake plant. Cecilia corrected her.	Same thing. Amanda replied. What is with this! A new chapter in your book of life?	No, well maybe Cecilia replied sheepishly, Just saw it and it cheered me up. She was reflective for a minute. Its been a tough year, with my mom dying last summer and my dad dying last week. You know, the decisions, the saying goodbye, the telling everyone.	Amanda now pointed her knife at Cecilia. Dont forget the grief. You need to handle that.	Well, Cecilia reflected. Maybe this is a first step towards that.	Amanda opened the bottle of Chianti while Cecilia took two large wine glasses out of the cupboard. Pouring generous amounts of equal part each glass, Amanda raised hers and then Cecilia raised hers in response.		Best friends forever! Amanda declared.	Salut! Cecilia replied and they began constructing the dinner. With the bottle of wine disappearing quickly, they decided that perhaps the promise of restraint was premature and Cecilia called down to her friend Mark who lived two floors below to bring in some reinforcements. Happily obliging, he arrived with two Beaujolais nouveau and a wonderful smile. Helping them with the settings, he then took the two bottles and proceeded to open one. As he cut the aluminum, he noticed the plant on the sill. Whats with the Mother in Law Tongue? he asked. Its a Sansevieria. Cecilia corrected him. Same thing, was his response as he uncorked the bottle and the level of the gathering elevated.	Over the next few hours more people were invited and with that the spirits switched from red to brown. It was about this time of the night when Mark was describing his stepmother while riding a broom between his legs like a pony, that the end of the broom snagged the side of the pot and the new addition went flying away from the window, crashing on the floor. Luckily the pot was a heavy plastic and remained intact and they were able to gather up the soil while Cecilia steadily centered the plant in the middle of the pot. Dont worry. Cecilia kept saying. You cant kill it. to reassure everyone.	A few hours later, the plants resolve was once again tested as a friend of Steves from down the block tried to balance the plant on his head. Swearing that he had a lineage to circus performers, he aptly showed he didn't carry the gene by allowing the pot to slide off his forehead and crash onto the floor, its fine, dry soil scattering over the area rug in a thin sheet. The clean ultra white roots showed helplessly as Cecilia once again gathered the plant and the pot and tried to reconnect them. In order to get the soil out of the rug, Amanda used a small dustbuster vacuum which cleaned it up, but also collected an abundance of dog hair. Emptying the container into the pot, the new plant was now leaning to one side comfortably nestled in a collection of dirty, long yellow fur, like a green obelisk growing out of Harpo Marxs wig. The plastic of the pot, which was so resilient before, fared poorly. This time a long crack showed up on one side, which Mark - the engineer as he reminded everyone- repaired with some gray duct tape he had found under the sink. Cecilia once again placed it back on the sill, saying aloud as if issuing a command. You cannot be killed.	As the evening faded away, the crowd began to thin and an intoxicated Cecilia made her way to her bedroom, where she leaned forward, hoping gravity would do the honorable thing and place her correctly on her pillow. 	She was roused to consciousness by a hot wind blowing on her face in quick bursts. Opening one eye, she turned her head and saw Ollie at the edge of the bed, his mouth lined with soily lipstick. The plant lay helplessly at his feet.	Oh Ollie. she said softly, the dog now wagging its tail at the sound of its name, stood up and jumped on the edge of the bed, licking her face with his loamy tongue.	She rose up in defense, only to feel a sudden onrush of blood into her head as the hangover commenced. Pushing the dog off, she reached over and picked up the plant. Many of the roots were broken and crushed by the dog's teeth, so she delicately lifted it from the floor and carried it back into the kitchen. On the way there she saw the pot on the floor. She picked that up with her other hand and carried everything over to the kitchen sink. She was able to collect the hair/soil mixture up again, although she added more duct tape to the pot to repair another crack, and just ignored the huge chip in the pot's edge. Once she had everything back together again, she noticed it was low on soil, so to compensate, she pushed the plant down forcefully to get it deeper into the pot. After two healthy pushes, she pushed hard one more time to make sure the plant would stay upright. In doing so, she felt a huge pop, and almost all of the tall leaves snapped off in her hand. Holding the victims in her palm, she stared at the creation in the sink. With one long leaf straight up in the center, there were now two much smaller leaves remaining on either side. She gazed at the new assembly, which she took to be a statement on her care so far. Equating the center leaf as a middle finger, she nodded. Ok, I deserve that. she said out loud.	Having now completed the reassembly, she placed it back on the window sill, made some coffee and sat in the dining room. She sipped it slowly as her senses began to return. After a few minutes, she heard a buzz on her phone and checked the text message.	Coming over in half an hour. Found some stuff you may want. You up? Normally after a morning like this one, she wouldnt have replied, but this was Brian her brother and she knew he was cleaning out some closets in her parents house. Up. she texted back, then gathered up the strength to get into the shower and get dressed.	As planned, Brian showed up and although she was still groggy, she was ready for him when he approached the door. As promised, he had with him a box of odds and ends. As he walked through the apartment, he noticed the plant.	Whats with the ? he asked.	It's a Sansevieria. she replied knowingly.	Same thing. he said as he furrowed his brow upon examining it closer.	You cant kill it. she answered defensely.	His face scrunched together with concern. That doesnt mean you have to try. When did you get it? he asked.	Yesterday afternoon. she answered. Want some coffee? she asked to change the topic.	Sure. Brian slowly poked at the fur. Did the plant come with some sort of insulation?	Cecilia ignored him and just continued talking. What stuff did you bring over? she asked as she brought him a full cup. She set it on the table and peered into the box.	Regaining his focus, Brian turned to the box. Oh, uh.. just some books, a few pictures of relatives you may know, because I surely dont know them and this. he pulled out a small, white vase with hand painted enamel lettering. I found this on an upper shelf in the closet. It said Love you champ! in a mixture of uneven blue and red letters.	Cecilia stared at the bowl adoringly. She set down her cup and gently took the bowl with her two hands. Sitting down she ran her fingers over the lettering softly. He made this for me. It was Fathers Day and I think I was like eight. Mom was there too, but she took you with her to get something or other. So he and I slipped into this pottery shop. You know one of those where you buy the pot and then paint whatever you want on it.	She stopped touching the bowl and looked nostalgically out of the window to the street outside. I made him a bowl that said Best Dad Ever.! and he made this one for me.	They were quiet as she processed the memory, then tears slowly began to trail down her cheeks. I miss him so much. she said with a sob. Brian picked up the emotion and reached out to her. She rose and fell into his arms as he held her tightly while she gently cried on his shoulder. After a few moments, she regained her composure and was able to stop crying.	Im sorry, she said. Sometimes it just catches me.	Its okay, he smiled. It gets to me too. They hugged for a moment longer, then Brian pulled away and placed his hands on the box. So um.. go ahead and go through this stuff. Let me know what you want or dont want. Then he rubbed the moisture out of his eyes.	He stayed for a while longer, to make sure she was okay. He even took Ollie out for a walk. Then after about an hour, he rose and began to take out his car keys. He looked back at his sister. Are you going to be alright sis?	She nodded her head and offered a weak smile. Im alright.	He studied her eyes and, satisfied that she was sincere, he gave her one more deep hug and left the apartment.	She sat there throughout the morning, still in a haze, but optimistic about the weekend as she touched base with friends and did some work. She was mostly in remembrance of the man who made the pot. Suddenly, the obvious struck. She left the apartment for a few hours and when she returned she had purchased a book on indoor plants, fresh potting soil, a grow light and a small packet of liquid fertilizer. Within a half an hour she had transplanted the plant into the new pot, replaced the soil, set up the light and fertilized the plant.	Im not giving up on you. she remarked as she continued checking it every day and following the care instructions. On the fourth day, she was rewarded. Getting ready to leave for work, she checked the plant before she left only to see a small, thin lime green leaf slowly snaking its way up out of the soil. Two days later, another appeared and a day later a third.	After two weeks, Amanda stopped by on a Sat. afternoon to see if Cecilia wanted to go out for lunch. Since Amanda hadnt seen the plant since its initiation ceremony, she was surprised at the change.	Hello. Amanda cooed to the plant. There is less of you, and yet more.	Yeah, Cecelia said. I snapped off a few leaves by accident, but I took care of it and now look at this. Its coming up fast.	Told you it cant be killed. Amanda said. Cute pot. Where did you get it?	Cecilia smiled as she slipped her hands into the front pockets of her jeans. It was from my dad."
The Photograph That Had Her Past Engraved On It,"Squabbling seagulls flew overhead. Rachel sat on the sand with waves crashing against her ankles. The waves of the sea produced an opera, that was soothing. The sea seemed like a beautiful woman dressed in a cerulean blue gown. At a distance, a little girl and her mother were playing in the water. The yacht rocked like a cradle and it felt as though the sea wanted to lul Rachel to sleep.She was physically miles away from the hullabaloo but her mind still lingered in the hospital. Pictures of the IV cannula, ice-cold stainless steel cot, the crisp white bedsheet and a frail figure cascaded before her. The screeching sound made by the wheelchair echoed in her ears. A cool breeze caressed her cheeks and her eyes fell on a velvet box that lay by her side.She squeezed her eyebrows and her right hand fluttered on her neck. With her left hand, she picked up the box and opened it. A family portrait stared at her. Tears welled in her eyes as her fingers took a tour of the photograph.Six months back, she had found an old film roll in an antique box that belonged to her father. Intrigued by the film and its contents, she grabbed it and stealthily slipped it into her bag. That evening, she walked into a photo studio and gave the film for processing. She was asked to receive the photographs the next day but destiny had other plans.Her father was diagnosed with cancer. The tumour ate away his cells and tissues at a rapid pace. The dreaded C jammed his tastebuds. Rachel moved in with her father. She was engulfed by the whirlpool of work and the 24*7 care his health demanded. The thoughts about the film roll had slipped her mind. Eventually, her father wasn't able to swallow the food and he lost a great deal of body weight.A week back, he complained of breathlessness and was rushed to the hospital. IV cannulas were inserted into his frail body. Blood works and scans were done. The doctors had diagnosed multiple organ failure and placed him on life support.The previous evening, he had summoned Rachel into the room and spoke, ""I have a confession to make. But remember, I love you. I have always loved you."" Tears coursed down his wrinkled cheeks. He slowly lifted his weary hand and pointed to a velvet box on the bedside table.""That's for you,"" he said. Rachel walked to the table and opened the box. She found a family portrait. The child in the portrait seemed familiar to her. Did she know her? Or was it her?The couple in the photograph looked unfamiliar. She looked at her father questioningly.He tapped on the bed asking her to sit by his side. He removed the oxygen mask and said, ""I saw you slipping the film roll into your bag. So I got it developed for you. The girl in that photograph is you. You were not born to us. You were my colleague John's daughter. He had lost his job and wasn't able to fend for you and his wife. On the contrary, I and your mom had everything in the world yet we weren't happy. We yearned for a child. Your mother had three miscarriages and had slipped into the abyss of apathy. In an attempt to restore the sunshine in our lives I decided that we must adopt a baby. When I had expressed my desire to adopt, John suggested that I adopt you. Though I was initially reluctant, his pathetic state of affairs convinced me to go with it.I offered him money and he had promised to bury our secret. You weren't happy with us for the initial six months. We showered you with love and undivided attention . You eventually got used to us. I and your mom were on cloud nine when you referred to us as mom and dad. Our joy knew no bounds. I hate to confess this to you but I won't live long and you deserve to have a family to call your own."" He gasped for breath and gripped the bedsheet.Rachel sat staring at him without uttering a word. He had begun to sweat profusely. ""I'm so sorry."" His voice was low as a whisper. His face seemed to be creased with lines of regret.She enveloped his hand in hers. His hand was cold as the iron rods lining the window. His face turned purple. He had finally breathed his last. She bent forwards, kissed him on his forehead and closed his eyes. Cancer took him away from her and the truth took away her joy. But nothing would ever be able to take away their beautiful and pure bond. Nothing could ever obliterate the memories of the time they had spent together. She tried to console herself but the truth pricked her soul questioning her very existence.The next morning, as she stood watching the casket being buried into the ground, she decided to meet her biological parents. She managed to acquire the address from an old diary that had accumulated dust on it.After an hour of steering through the traffic, she reached the Eden house. She opened the gate and entered and saw that two young girls were playing on the porch. A sexagenarian man entered the porch. She assumed that he was her biological father John. A woman joined the family and they ate breakfast. She walked to them and introduced herself. The moment John heard her name the smile on his face vanished. The woman who was supposedly Rachel's biological mother whose name she didn't bother to find wasn't happy either.""She is my colleague's daughter,"" John spoke to the young girls who looked at Rachel questioningly.After a few minutes, the girls excused themselves. ""I'm your daughter,"" spoke Rachel swallowing the lump in her throat.""You are not our daughter. You never were. You were a mistake. We had given you to Tim. You got a good life and we got some money. A few years later, we were blessed with two beautiful daughters. We are a happy family and wish to remain one. We don't want you back in this house,"" spoke John.The woman didn't utter a word and looked at Rachel as though she concurred with John's opinion. Rachel walked away with the tears choking her.She didn't want to live with her biological parents. Tim had given her the best of everything. He was her father and would always be. All she wanted was to spend one day with her biological parents. Hug them, talk to them, eat with them but they had forgotten her. Just like the waves that omit the names written on the sand money had omitted her from their lives.The smell of the sea tantalized her nostrils breaking her reverie. She got up and walked to the sea. She bent and dropped the velvet box in the water. The waves carried the box that was engraved with her past.She gave her past a sea burial. Tim was her father. He loved her and that's all that mattered.She walked away ready to face the new dawn that brought with it hope, positivity and an opportunity to live life to the fullest."
Archie the Tree Monster,"Lee-Roy White snickered as he took off the stolen rain jacket.Hed been warm and dry all the way home, even his hair, thanks to the jackets hood.It looked like a golf jacket, and it was big enough to fit him.On Wussy Wyatt, itd come down to his bony knees. .  He hung it up in the entryway that his father called  only cuz it had tiled flooring..He snickered again at the thought of that skinny little goomba soaking wet and shivering on his walk home from school. He almost walked away but looked down at the pockets.He had patted them down earlier, theyd felt empty.Now, he felt inside each one.The outer two had zippers covered with protective flaps.Empty.The inner one had stiff papers in it, the size of the recipe cards his mother used to have.Photos.Three were photos of himself.The fourth was one apparently taken on a Halloween night. *** Thursday, one day earlierWyatt Summerland the Third ate his lunch on the farthest corner of The Broken Field.The high school staff called it The Right Field.The jocks from decades past had called it The Field of Broken Bones. The current jock bullies continued the tradition of terrorizing the weaker boys by accidentally tackling or tripping the smaller boys during games of flag football.The coaches turned a blind eye, they favored the jocks and most likely had been those same bullies in their high school years.Wyatt pushed the black frame of his glasses up his nose.He hated gym class; he was always picked last.Starling sat down next to Wyatt.(Her name was Samantha Sterling) but the popular girls in the school renamed her right around the second grade.She was thin and as delicate as a bird after all, and black.She had fluffy pom pom pigtails and a mouthful of glinting pewter teeth.Starling peeled open her chocolate pudding and scooped some daintily into her mouth.Wyatt said, You only eat pudding for lunch? Starling swallowed, took a sip of her milk, and said, Once I made the mistake of eating a BLAT in the caff.A year ago, when I got my braces.It was so gross.Evvie made fun of me, said I looked like a monster from a lagoon cuz I had strings of lettuce stuck right in the front.It took nearly the rest of lunch hour to get all the crap outta my stupid braces.I was so embarrassed; every time someone came into the bathroom I hid in a stall. Gross.Sorry.But ew.I get the pudding thing now.How much longer do you have to wear them?Six more months at least.The rest of the school year.But youll have great teeth for the twelfth grade.Movie Star Teeth. Starling covered her mouth as she laughed.Wyatt figured it would be a long time before she lost that habit.He looked across The Broken Field.Lee-Roy White stood at the far end..  Lee-Roy said something to the boys on either side of him and pointed two fingers at Wyatt then at his own eyes..The three boys laughed. Starling said, Why does he hate you so much?Hes just a bully.Like his dad. Starling nodded.Everyone talked about the fat, finger shaped bruises emblazed upon Lee-Roys pale arms and the occasional black eye.No one in school had done that to him.No one dared.The kid was huge.At seventeen, he stood six feet tall.He was lean and roped with muscley bulges and knobs.A teacher had told him once he needed a haircut, told him he looked like a hoodlum with it worn so long.From his desk at the back of the room, he shrugged then said, Chicks dig it.The class had laughed. That teacher had later found her car had been keyed, two thick wavering lines ran down each side of the little blue Corolla. Lee-Roy was not afraid of anyone. Wyatt said, Hes my nemesis.I stay out of his way. Starling rubbed her bare mocha colored shin. Her socks were short, her capri pants had risen over her knees.Wyatt noticed the spot she rubbed sported a very prominent lump. He said, Field hockey?Yup, youre not the only one who gets bullied.I fucking HATE gym class.Me too.Wyatts in my gym class.That fucking sucks. The bringing-buzzing of the bell rang out.Wyatt said, And speaking of gym class They got up and walked across the field.Starling veered off towards the corridor to the left.She waggled her fingers goodbye and said, Good luck.Thanks.He took one final glace at the sky.It was still blue in places, but heavy grey clouds were darkly taking over.  Gym class was okay that day, they played badminton because it was supposed to rain.Badminton was cool cuz was not a team sport.After the class, Wyatt was the first to head to the changing room after the hour was up- he liked to change quickly and be out of Lee-Roys radar field as fast as possible. Wyatt jumped into the shower farthest from the lockers.He froze as a shadow paused at the curtain.He let his breath out as the shadow departed.He showered and rinsed as if he were in a race.With luck, Lee-Roy would still be showering when he was long gone.He peeked out the stall.No nemesis.He reached to the peg where his towel was. Not there. He looked at the blue tiled floor.No towel..Not only was there no towel, but his jeans were also gone.He used his gym shirt to towel off, but it was moist with sweat, he had no choice but to put his sweaty gym shorts back on.They suctioned onto his damp thighs like limpets on tidal rocks.He buttoned his shirt, groaning at the way it clung to his chest and back.Wyatt caught something dark from the corner of his eye as he passed the bank of urinals.In one of them, all balled up and soaking wet, were his Levis., he thought.The hill-billy guffawing behind him reddened his face uncontrollably. The grating laughter was followed by, Check that out!You can see everything!Hey lil dude, that lil worm so small not even yer girlfriend, the black bird, could find it! He didnt pause at the mirror, but finger combed his hair into place as he headed for the door to the hallway.Half the students pointed and laughed as he walked swiftly through the hallway.The other half whispered to their friends as they stared.Only a couple of kids looked away, pity painted on their faces.He didnt stop at the door to his history class, he kept going straight, into the nearly empty cafeteria, and out the side door to the bike racks.  As he pedaled as fast as he could, it began to rain.  His mother wasnt home yet, she worked late Thursdays, and on those nights, he made dinner for them.She probably wouldnt notice the absence of the Levis but if she did, hed tell her they were too short, so hed put them in the Goodwill box, which, by the way, hed taken into town the day before. The deluge of rain worsened into a fantastic storm.Wyatts invisible friend would be pleased.He particularly loved thunder and lightning and the violence of hurricane winds.His gleeful enthusiasm had infected Wyatt as well, he went outside into the pitch-black yard and put his face into the torrents.He said, Its a good one, eh, Archie? A voice drifted down from above, Indeed it is, little friend ArchieSorry.Wyatt Summerland the Third. The voice was deep but light and melodic, like Barry White speaking in sotto voce.Ha!What a laugh.Wyatt Summerland the Second had left when he was two, leaving him nothing but a fancy name.Wyatt Summerland the First had died of a heart attack five years previously.He was technically Wyatt Summerland the Only. White lights painted the fence for a second, dimmed by the downpour. Shes home.Gotta go, Wyatt said to the shadow man.Ciao buddy.    The next morning was drizzly and dark, with intermittent showers. Wyatt spent too long searching his drawers, his closet, the hall closet, for his hooded waterproof jacket.When at last he found it, he realized he was going to be late for school.At the school, he stopped at his locker, noting how empty the halls were.He grabbed his binder and algebra book and slammed the door shut.He raced down the hall to his homeroom, slipping and sliding a couple of times like a cartoon character. The second bell razzled shrilly and echoingly behind him as he leapt into the classroom. Im here! he exclaimed as he ran to his seat in the second row.Hill-billy guffaws from the back row. The teacher glared over his half spectacles which always seemed to hang on the end of his thin, pointed nose like magic.Yes, I see that.I also see that youre dripping all over my floor. Wyatt didnt think it wise to point out the floor wasnt actually  but belonged to whomever owned the school.Maybe it was the countys floor.There was a row of eight coat hooks at the back of the room.He hung his dripping jacket on the end, next to a green striped sweater that had been there since his first day.Kids claimed it was haunted, that it had belonged to Freddy Kruger.He hustled back to his desk and Mr. Altera continued announcing next weeks events in his nasally, monotone drawl.Homeroom was fifteen minutes long.Today it seemed an hour.Sure enough, when the bell rang for the first class of the day, Mr. Altera asked Wyatt to, Hold up a sec.Im sorry I was late Mr. Altera; it wont happen again.Apology accepted.And seeing as this was your first time, Ill let it go.Manage your schedule better.Youll need to in the real world.Thank you, sir. He scooped up his books and took off for his algebra class.  As he sat in his seat near the front, he realized hed forgotten his jacket.    As he walked into his homeroom, he saw immediately that his jacket was gone.The room was empty.Mr. Altera was absent.He ran to the coat hooks, nothing on the floor.He peeked under the ugly sweater with a pencil, careful not to touch it just in case.Nope. *** Back to FridayFucking Wuss-boy!What the hell?!Hed nearly dropped the photos.He feltafraid.Of Wyatt.Ridiculous.He feared no oneexceptHis vision went red as he pictured a meaty fist darkening with knuckle shadows as it came towards his eye.He felt the sharp pain of his nose cartilage separating from bone and the thudding pain in his eye socket as it crinkled inwards toward his eyeball. He felt the pressure of the eyeball push inwards.His father.He was okay most of the time.No, thats a lie.He drank every night.He morphed into a monster every night that he could not always avoid. Lee-Roy looked at the photos in his hand and studied each one.He had sat down on the crumpled sheets of his bed without realizing hed even moved, let alone found his way to his room.He shoved dirty clothes from the floor to uncover the toolbox. It locked.It was empty of tools and was stocked instead with cans of Coors hed swiped after his father had passed out.He even had a travel mug half full of swiped Jack Daniels.It was the Jack his trembling fingers grabbed.As he sipped, he studied the photos.One showed his father and him on their front porch.Hed been wearing a tee-shirt; under the yellowy porchlight he saw the deep shadows under the fingers that were squeezing his biceps.The next was taken that same night, after Lee-Roy had been thrown to the ground.His fathers fist was raised high- high for greater momentum and greater impact.The third photo was a view through the living room window.Fathers left hand held Lee-Roy by the throat the right was raised- high.The fourth picture was the Halloween one.Lee-Roy smiled.The scary decoration revealed glowing eyes and sharp white teeth in an ear-to-ear grin, the gnarled outline of a tree behind it lit up by lightning added to the illusion of scariness. Later, in bed, Lee-Roy listened to the muted voices of David Letterman and his guest.By now, Pops would be passed out, and he was safe.As his breathing deepened, the last thoughts poked at the logic in his brain.? *** Monday came at last.Lee-Roy watched The Wuss eating his lunch on the far side of the field.The black chick (his father called them niggers, but Lee-Roy didnt understand racism.He secretly thought Starling was kinda sexy) was sitting next to him eating her pudding.Phil and Dave came up.Phil said, Whatchoo got planned today for the little geek?Lee-Roy didnt look away from the field.He said, Oh, Ill think of something.   Lee-Roy followed Wyatt to his house.It wasnt hard, the kid lived on a street lined with plenty of big oaks to hide behind.He saw the kid enter a small but neat house.He watched across the street as lights came on in the living room and deeper into the place.Kitchen.An older model Chevy Malibu pulled into the driveway and a petite brunette in a waitress uniform- old-fashioned, like ones hed seen on 'Alice'-got out and went inside.It was getting dark, and Lee-Roy felt bolder under the cover of night.He crept around to the back yard, unlatched the fence gate, and hid behind a maple in the yard. He saw the kid and his mom chat for a bit then she left the kitchen.The kid stirred a pot on the stove, turned a knob, then headed out the kitchen door. Before coming out, Wyatt turned off the porchlight.He came into the blackened yard and said, Archie?Lee-Roy jumped out from behind the maple and said, We need to talk! He grabbed the smaller kids arm and pulled him behind the tree.In pitch darkness, Wyatt said, You found the photos, didnt you?Lee-Roy grabbed the other arm and shook the kid.Then he let go.Red memories of his father let go as well.He said, Why?Wyatt said, I took them to help you.What!?Yes! Ive been studying you.I was -- writing a paper on, well, .Figuring out why and what makes you be like you.Its obviously because of your upbringing.Your fatherand absent mother.Lee-Roy gawped at Wyatt.He gestured for Wyatt to go on, too stunned for words.Im going to college to study psychiatry.Im getting a scholarship.I got so involved with my study of your case that I may have stepped out of line.I took those pictures thinking Id have proof of the abuse, take them to authoritiesBut you didnt, right?No.I got to thinking that youd be sent to foster care and that may make you even worse.As a person.And your dad too.Why would you care about me?Youre not stupid.You can change.And Im studying it.Hmm. Lee-Roy fell against the tree as if the life-force had flown from his body.I can help you.In a totally unconventional way. Lee-Roy felt as if hed been squashed under a boulder like the coyote in the roadrunner cartoons, but he also felt the boulder lifting.It was .He said, That other pictureit was weird.My invisible friend.After my dad left, I started talking to him.He was just a black tree at first, this one.He pointed to the old maple.One night the tree spoke back.That thing in the picture wasnt a decoration.It was real.Yes.Archie.I call him my invisible friend because he only comes to me in shadowsHes really tall.And thin.Like a tree with a face and glowing eyes and teethAnd horns like a Texas bull.He doesnt like his picture taken cuz he needs to be invisible to humans.He fakes being a tree really well.I convinced him hed pass for a Halloween decoration.I think youre just scaring meto get even or something. A voice from the dark came down like Barry White whispering, You want my help or not kid?Lee-Roy looked up but saw nothing.The moon was only  full, but bright enough.From behind the tree came Archie.As he unfolded his thin, fifteen-foot body, he turned, revealing an ear-to-ear grin that glistened in the moonlight.His body was indeed like a gnarled, tall black tree.His eyes glowed. *** After the visit to Lee-Roys dad, Lee-Roy never again worried about being beaten.His pop was going to AA meetings every night and Lee-Roy made sure they shared a healthy meal. Wyatt wrote his paper, got his scholarship, and went on to Yale.Lee-Roy stayed in Ferndale, devoting his career towards troubled youths and coaching Ferndales high school in a fair and entirely new way.Him and Wyatt stayed in touch and became the closest of friends.Archie moved on to be another lonely kids best invisible friend."
MOUSE and THE LAME PIGEON,"MOUSEandTHE LAME PIGEON Of course , from a cat called Mouseyou can expect at leastsomething unusual, extravagantBut this then I would never have expected ! Anita said, as soon as she came back home.  What has Sofias cat been up to?Her mother asked, while she was checking the cookingof the chicken in the casserole.  Ah, remember her mother added, holding up the fork with which she had pricked the meat of the chickenyou must rememberthat it was Sofiawho called that poor cat Mouse. The cat Mouse has nothing to do withthe name it bears. If anything, we should ( have to) wonder what to expect from someonewho calls her cat MOUSE Yes, I agree, that one, Sofia is a bit deranged. Oh, but in my opinion, if she is so crazy, it is because of that guy with whom she lives  Anita said But listen!Wouldit be because of her co-living ifSofia is touched? I wouldnt say its right. Hee,rather it is she,Sofia , who is beaten up on her own. He, instead, her partner is even a good painter Anitas mother said.  But yes, a very good painter! In fact he calls himself Botticelli.What a presumption!  Anita snapped . But, lets forget Botticelli and Sofia too. Dont you want to know what Mouse did?she asked. Of course I want to know. On, tell me  Then, listen. When, a little ago, coming back home, I passed in front of Marianna s house, in the courtyard in front of her house,there was a pigeonstanding on the sidelines, which moved with hesitant, little steps and was limping.( which limped too).. It didnt really looked healthy, that pigeon.Its feathers were ruffled and almost dirty.It looked old and battered. This pigeonnot only kept awayfrom the chickens, the ducks, and other animals , there in the courtyard, but it seemed to be afraid of them. Anita started telling, as she jumped sitting on the table, getting a stern look from her mother. Im listening, but I expectedyou would tell me about Mouse, notabout a pigeon Sara, Anitas mother , said, almost impatient. Wait, it is just about Mouse that Im going to tell you  Anita said, jumping off the table. Then, I stopped there, in front of the courtyard just because I was intrigued by this pigeon which,in my opinion, was even not able to fly, when I saw Mouse arrive. The cat, moving in thick and fast steps, went very close to the pigeon.Now I expected that, for a young cat like Mouse, a pigeon so shabby, even lame, even not able to fly, it would be an easy prey. So that, as I saw Mouse approaching the pigeon, I expected to see the poor pigeon in the cats clutches.But instead.oh, my God , you knew what happenedAnita stoppedsuddenlyspeaking, as if she was breathless. She seemed too agitatedto be able to continue her story( to tell). Look, if Sofias catdidnt attack ( catch)that pigeon, it was probably because, as you said, it was old and run down so that the cat was not interested in hunting it. The cat knew, or rather felt the old pigeon wouldnt be good to eat Sara said, with nonchalance.  Oh, but Mouse didnt just not grab ( catch) the pigeon,the cat even started licking the pigeon!Mouse lickedits head and its body, oh, you saw!And the pigeon, as the cat was lickingit, gave it very light pecks, right withthe tip of the beak, as of to return the favorOh, what a sight.I stayed there completely stunned  Anita was talking going up and down the room , with an enchanted look, as ifshe still had the cat and the pigeon under her eyes, while they werecuddled each other. Come on, I really dont find ( see) anything so extraordinary in it Sara commented.  It maybe the cat licked the pigeon to know if it was edible.And the pigeon, on its part, pecked the cat to make it understandthat it had still the beak to defend itselfif the cat intended to eat it.  Ah, I see you dont understandbut you should have been there, seeing them with your own eyes. They would have moved you too Anita sighed, sorry forthe skepticismwith which her mother commented on the story of that for her was somethingabsolutely extraordinary , incredible for herself, if she hadnt seen it with her own eyes.  But I didnt tell you everything, there is still more  Anita said, and kept on telling, undaunted. After having been an almost long time the cat to lick the pigeon and the pigeonto reciprocate with very light pecks, the two animals started walking, side by side , on the edge of the courtyard. They were quite distant from the other animalspresent there in the courtyard, at which they ( the cat and the pigeon) now and then, cast a glance, as if to make sure that no one of those otherswere approaching them. Oh, it was really a wonder, truly enchantingto see Mouse and the pigeon , as they walked, turn they heads, point their muzzle or beak atthose over there, to make sure those there stayed at a safe distance, that those there werent going to bother them.Anita fell silent suddenly, as if she was out of breath. She keptlookinginsistently at her mother, whocontinued to stand bent overthe stove, without saying a word, without looking at her. Ah, you had seen them  Anita came back telling  They walked side by side and, now and then, they stopped and stood facing each otherand they started talking, maybe even arguingOh, I swear that really it seemed they were talking  Anita kept telling more and more enthusiast.  Ah, then the cat and the pigeon were talking ( Or: but well, you saw the cat and the pigeon that were talking).and, lets hear, what language were they speaking? Sara snorted, who seemed not to wantto give much weight ( importance) to what Anita was telling. Oh, Mom, but what a question! When I saythatMouse and the pigeonwere talking, I dont mean they really spoke. Of course ,at least they didnt speaka language made up with words, and, in any case, not even ( made) of gestures and sounds that I could understand. Yet I betthey were talking, like two friends can do during a walk Sara was not at all impressed by what Anita told her about Mouse and that ( the) pigeon, as she thought that her daughter was exaggerating the extent of what she had seen, that she had become too enthusiastic. Yet something really unusual (rare), even if not entirely extraordinary,had truly happenedbetween that greatcurious playful which was Mouse ,the cat of the extravagant Sofia , and that lame and battered pigeon to which no onehad thought to give a name. No one, but perhaps except Mouse. Who knows howthe cat Mouse called that pigeon. Since Mouse and the lame pigeonhad become friends. It had happened thatthat old pigeon, when he was already lame, but was still able to fly, in one of its last flights, had landedright in the courtyardin front of Mariannes house. For the old pigeon, lame andrun down ,it had been a real fortune. In the courtyard there were hens, chickens , ducks, all animalswhich were regularlygiven to eat, that is to peck, so that the old and battered pigeoncould it toofind something to peck. In that courtyard.Mouse( the cat Mouse) which was everyday roamingaround in the countryside,was an habitu of the courtyard in front of Mariannas house, where, you could say, he knew one by one the hens, the chickens the ducks, the turkeys. Ah, how much he ( the cat) likedto run after the hens, to make them run away, as if he was giving them the hunt. And it happened that sometimes the cat received also somepecks, not at all light, from the hens. But when they, the hens, stretched out their beaks, hepulled outhis claws. It was he, Mouse, which ran awayscared ( frightened) when the geese, arranged in a team,stretching their long necks, started to chase him, cackling at full beak.Here, it was ( had been) in this courtyard that, one day, Mouse had seenthe lame pigeon. He had seen thepigeonwhile it ( the pigeon) was standing alooffrom the other animals, , moving only a little its head, which seemed fearful. Mouse was a great hunter, evenof pigeons, of course, which he found very tasty to eat. Ah, their meat was delicious, both raw and cooked.Yes, since Mouse had also eaten( tasted) the pigeon cooked. She, his great friend Sofia, oh, she couldcook the pigeon in different very tasty ways. He , MOUSEcouldnot but help be sorry that Sofia cooked only pigeonsshe went to take from that there, that horrible guy wearing a bloody apron, ahshecame home with pigeons already dead andplucked .Ah, if shehad cooked the pigeons he hunted, instead! Mouse had alsobrought ( taken) the pigeons he had caught into house, but Sofia oh, had lookedat him angry, she hadsent him, with the pigeon out of house. So, as soon as Mousesaw that pigeon there, almost at the end of the courtyard , he , since he was a ca( as a cat he was) widened his eyes , rolled( rubbed) his clawson the ground, ready , indeed impatientto launch into the attack. And he leftas fast as a lightening : he knew he had to grab the beast ( pigeon)before it could take off.And yet that pigeonhadnt taken off at all. It hadnt even tried to escape, it had moved only a bit, but Mouse could then notice that the pigeonwas lame. The cathad swooped down on the pigeon , ready to grab it with his claws, ready to pierce it with his teeth, oh, but that smell.that smell which took your breath away.A musty, stinking sewagesmell,emanated from the pigeon, had made him ( Mouse)soon give up his prey. Mouse was trembling with fear, as he left the pigeon slip out of his claws . Since that lame, balding pigeon , with even a not bright eye, not only would it not have been good to eat, but it was a danger too. That smellof acidic slime , but, at the same timeof mold, which emanated from the pigeonfor him ( Mouse)meant DANGER! WarningDANGER!The lame pigeon was plaguedand it would have plagued him too! Mousehad not only given up on huntingit , he had escaped from that plagued animal, since he did not wantto be plagued ( he) too.Sofias cat had escapedaway, even if he hadntstarted running.Mouse hadgone away, taking that long step, stretching his front legs out before him, that same step he took when he waspursued by thecackling geese.So the cat had crossed the courtyard, his front legs stretched forward, in a very short time. When he was going to leave the courtyard, Mousecould not help but glance behind him.Oh, he saw that the lame and stinking pigeon with its uncertain, hesitant steps, and limping, was moving ( walking) towards him! Yes, the lame, stinking pigeon was followinghim!Sure, it ( the pigeon) was still at a considerable distance from him, but if it hadstarted flying, hecould reach him in an instant ( immediately) Yeah, if the pigeonwouldtake flightBut why it didnt fly? That pigeon hadnt even taken flight when hewas about to catch it .Then the lame pigeon couldnt even fly, Mouse realized.If Anita had been remainedvery amazed and even very much movedby the meeting of Mouse with the lame pigeon, which she had happened to witness, who knows how she would have remained if she could haveseen what happened that day, when Mouse and the lame pigeon, they had seen each other ( they had met) for the first time. Ah, what happened then, in that courtyardcrowded with animals, only they, the animalswhich were in the courtyard, could know ( witness). Not a dog passed which could see ( what washappening). Mouse had just realizedthat the foul-smelling pigeoncould not fly, and, forgetting that he had to get away fromit, in order not to be plagued, he stood looking atthe pigeon as it trudged, laboriously, limping, towards him. The pigeon was stretching its neck, was stretching its beak towards him. Here, it seemed that the pigeon was saying somethingto him, Mouse, yes, just with its beak, that was pointed at him.With its beak, not with its eyes, the lame , stinkingpigeon was saying somethingto him.Mouse couldnt understand what the pigeon was saying to him, but he was sure that the damned beast was saying something just to him. Meanwhile thecacklinggeese attackedthe lame pigeon with their strong beaks. The geese, cackling louder than ever, were tearing off its feathers, giving it ( the poor beast) big pecks. Then Mouse, it could be saidthat he was the onewhich took off.In a flash he was nextto the lame pigeon , and he lashed out furiously,on the geese, clawing and biting them.The cats interventionhad to surprise a lotthe geese, which closed their beaks , gave up the poor pigeon and, muted, moved away, with their tails between their legs. The lame pigeon, batteredmore than ever, quite plucked, and Mouse stoodfacing each otherfor an almost long time, and perhapsthey said something each other , with their eyes, with minimal gestures. The pigeon craned its neck up and, with its beak in the air, made a sound which was not the usual cooing of pigeons, but rather a kind of cry.Mouse raised a paw, as ifto place it on the pigeon, but then soon withdrewit and held ( placed) it on his chest.It seemed that the two animals were making a pact, an agreement between them.And this was happeningwhile all the other animals in the yard ( crowding the yard) moved away from them."
Tonys Picnic    - Another Tony Adventure,"Tony, Antonias stuffed panda, tried to control his excitement. He watched the commotion of prepping for a family excursion to the woods. Anticipation made him quiver with excitement. Not wanting to be left behind, he sat amidst the chaos.Tony always wanted to go on a picnic and Get back to the land, as the song said. Only Tony heard, get back to bamboo. Either way, he wanted to reconnect with his roots. Especially if they were bamboo roots. Antonia placed Tony atop the wicker picnic basket. She called out, Mom! Thats everything! She went to the car. Tony held his breath until placed safely between Antonia and her little sister Cindy. Jane, their mother, sat behind the drivers seat. All aboard! Everyone present and accounted for? Seat belts?Wheres Dolly! Cindy cried in a panic. She was here! We cant go! Tony sighed. Dolly could never resist making a problem. Jane rested her head on the steering wheel and counted to ten.Antonia said, Dont sit there crying. Go find her.But I brought her! She was right here!Jane said, Everyone stay put. She stepped out, opened the back of the SUV and rummaged. Cindy sniffed. Tony hoped Dolly wasnt lost. The picnic would be cancelled. He would miss her, of course. But he really wanted to go on the picnic. Antonia said, Dont worry. Tony says shes around. Well find her, Cin.Jane opened Cindys side of the car. There she is! Right under your feet. She retrieved Dolly from the floor and smoothed her dress. Buried in with the jackets. Guess it was too cool for her. She passed Dolly to Cindy, kissed her head and shut the door.Tony says, Too cool for the room.He does not! She just fell.Jane got in and started the car. Seat belts, everyone! Especially Dolly and Tony.Antonia said, Got em, Mom. She whispered, Dont be such a drama queen, Cindy. You know Tonys humor.Yeah, he says what you cant get away with.Tony says he can speak for himself.Then let him. You stay out of it.Stop bickering, or Ill turn the car around.They were on their way.Arriving at the picnic spot, they unpacked the car and found a sunny spot in a meadow. Beautiful trees towered around the clearing. A chorus of birds sang. The girls had never been to the forest. They lay on the grass, pointing at clouds while Jane prepared lunch. Cindy said, I see a pig.Antonia pointed. See the duck?Cindy held Dollys arm up. Look, a sheep.Tony wonders why no one sees a panda.Cindy pointed at Tony. I see youTony means in the clouds.Cindy asserted, Tony, clouds arent black and white.Tony asked if they have to be fluffy farm animals. Theyre clouds, Tony. Tony sees an airplane.Cindy became impatient. That is an airplane.Tony says he knows. He saw it first.Thats silly. Even Dolly sees its not a cloud.Tony asked, do they have to be fluffy and smell bad? Or just fluffy?Cindy looked over to her mother. Mom! Jane held a finger up. Just a minute, kidsCindy scoffed. Clouds dont smell bad, Tony.Farm animals do.Jane called out. Come and get it! Cindy scrambled to her feet and ran to the picnic. Bout time!Antonia said, Tony sees a sandwich.The picnic went well. The tuna burgers were delicious. They finished the big bag of potato chips. Cindy said, The perfect mix of pickles and mayo, Mom.Antonia said, Tony wishes thered been more bamboo.Thanks, Cindy. Tell Tony Ill address that on the next picnic.After lunch, the girls languished. Jane stood and clapped her hands. Lets explore for acorns and visit the lake.Antonia set Tony atop the picnic basket. Keep look-out, Tony. Dont let anyone take our stuff. Tony stared fiercely into the distance.Cindy propped Dolly back-to-back with Tony. She hoped Dolly could sweeten Tonys sharp tongue.The sisters followed their mother and disappeared into the trees. Tony watched them go. He held his gaze, determined to scare off intruders.Jane led her daughters to the ridge overlooking the lake. Look kids What do you see?They saw three raccoons, a mother and two kits, moving away through a clearing.Wow! They thrilled at seeing animals in the wild.Back at the picnic spot. Tony saw the raccoons approach. He didnt know what they wanted but he knew he must resist them.The raccoons methodically hunted the site. Smelling food, they knocked Tony and Dolly off the basket and rummaged through it. They took what they could carry and then circling, sniffed Tony. He held still as possible.The mother raccoon, Bazile, grunted. Tony said, Take me, if you must. But leave Dolly. Shes useless. I mean, shes no use to you.Bazile slung Tony onto her back and lumbered toward the trees. Tony whooped and hollered as he bounced along. Her two little ones followed closely. Back in the forest, the raccoons scampered up an ancient oak. They ate and slept where three large branches split from the trunk. Bazile placed Tony in the center. Unusual sounds, from above, drew their attention. Three chirping blue birds circled over Tonys head, trailing bright ribbons from their beaks. In awe, Tony could only watch. Bazile and her kits left food at his feet, bowing in homage. This completely surprised Tony. Expecting to get eaten, they honored him like royalty.He thought, TUnsure of the etiquette such situations required, Tony assumed a noble pose. Holding his head up, he nodded, acknowledging the raccoons tribute.He said, Call me King Tut Tut.A scream drew their attention to the base of the tree. There, Antonia ran in circles, pointing and wailing. Her shouting attracted others. Children and parents gathered and looked into the tree. Tony and the raccoons stared back.A park ranger named Greg arrived in his truck to assess the situation. Clutching her mothers skirts, Antonia whimpered and fretted over Tonys safety. Cindy said, Whos the drama queen now? Holding Dolly close they gazed into the branches above.Antonia ignored her. She pleaded Tonys case to Ranger Greg. Please save him, Mr. Ranger. Hes my Tony Panda. Ive had him forever.Janes imploring look confirmed Tonys importance to Antonia. Grunting, he nodded and set about rescuing Tony.He fetched some climbing equipment from his truck, including heavy duty web belts utility workers use to climb electrical poles. After attaching cleats to his boots, he fed the belt around the tree and secured it to his harness. Greg worked his way up the tree to where the trunk branched off. By the time he got there, mother Bazile and her kits had fled to safety further up the tree. Greg pulled himself up to find Tony glaring at him. Tony thought, The ranger grabbed Tony.  Greg didnt respond. He tucked Tony behind the strap and descended to the base of the tree. Antonia gratefully took Tony into her arms and squeezed him. Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Ranger!Applause from on lookers made Antonia hold Tony up. Shed never seen him look so happy.Jane told Greg, I cant tell you how much this means. You saved the day.Greg demurred, Its all part of the jobIs there anything we can do?Not at all. It was kind of fun. The raccoons didnt mistreat Tony. Looks like they took care of him.Tony thought, Greg left and the crowd dispersed. Jane and the girls strolled back to their picnic spot. Antonia placed Tony safe on the grass by the car. Now, you stay here, Tony.Jane and the girls packed the car. Their day was waning. Tony sat and watched them. He thought,  It had gotten warm. He began to itch. He wondered,  He noticed an ant crawling on his foot. He said, Do you know where I could get some bamboo to munch on?Packed and ready, Jane did a quick inventory. Picnic basket, cooler, blanket anything else? Cindy, you have Dolly?Safe in the back seat, Mom.Antonia?No, no, noShe ran frantically around the SUV and fell to her knees, looking under the car.Wheres Tony! Cindy, what did you?No! I didnt touch your grubby bear.Jane asked, Where did you put him?He was right here! Where could he be? Antonia began to wail.Now what? Jane walked around the car and sighed. Stop whining, Antonia. He must be nearby Shielding her eyes from the setting sun, Jane scanned their surroundings. She gasped and pointed. There!Antonia followed her gaze. At the bend in the path they saw Tony lying on his back, moving slowly away. Antonia sprinted to him and screamed. A swarm of ants carried him.She picked Tony up and began brushing ants off of him.With each slap, Tony said, Holding him tightly, Antonia returned to the car. She secured him in the back seat, next to Cindy.Jane asked, What happened?Antonia shook her head. Ants had him. They were taking him toward the bamboo by the stream.That Tony. What can you do?They laughed, got into the car and went home."
Ye Olde Library,"It was a foggy afternoon in the city. Claire had finished her shift at the convenience store and was making her way back home. Having lived in the city for so long, she had gotten to know all the short cuts and alleyways. She made her way towards one of the alleyways, but instead was greeted by a red sign saying Road works. Claire huffed, before turning on her heels and walking towards another of the alleywaysShe rarely used this route, as it was longer than her usual walk, but also the roads were cobbled which made them difficult to walk on. Through the fog, she saw a dim light on the right-hand side of the road. As she got closer, she realised the light was emitting from a small store. A sign hung from a metal frame jutting out of the wall. It was square with gold writing inked onto it, reading Ye Olde Library. This sparked Claires interested. She looked at her watch, she had plenty of time to kill before she needed to get home, so she wandered over.The store itself seemed to almost blend in with the rest of the houses that surrounded it, had it not been for the sign above it. The wooden framework had worn away in places. Filigree that was once carved into the wood were now just lumps and grooves. A message hung loosely in the window, even the paint on that had come away in patches. It read Open. Claire put her hand on the door and pushed.As Claire entered the store, a small chime came from the bell above as it rattled against the door. Claire looked up; a semicircle had been worn into the door from the years of the bell moving across it. Inside the store, the books appeared to be worn down as well, covered in a thin layer of dust. But there were so many books. Books stacked in the shelves; sideways, vertical and slanted. Books piled on the floor, taking up almost all the walking space that there was. The place itself was so small, the books made it even more cramped. The wooden floorboards had worn away in areas, while other areas still maintained their varnish. These were more obvious in corners and against walls where books had been piled. The wooden framework extended to the interior as well. Everything was the same colour of brown throughout, though the golden light from the oil lamp styled light fixtures made it seem homely.She picked up one of the nearby books and examined the cover, attempting to beneath the dust that had settled on it. She opened it and flipped through the pages. As she did so, a cloud erupted from it. Claire was taken aback by this eruption and began to cough. Then she heard footsteps. They seemed to be coming from the back of the library, perhaps even down some stairs. As the steps moved closer, the floorboards began to creak. The steps were heavy and deep. A figure then rounded the corner.Claire audibly gasped. Before her stood a tall man, made taller still by the slight incline of the floor. He barely fit through the frame of the doorway; his shoulders touched the sides and he had to duck to get under. He was bulky all over, his arms and legs like trucks of trees. His face was hidden beneath a cloud of beard. It cascaded over his chin and rested on top of a pile of books he was holding. His hair was greying, but below his burrowing brows were kind, blue eyes. His hair was pulled back by a headscarf, exposing his forehead. His clothes were dusty, worn and tattered. They seemed to match the rest of the interior of the library.Sorry to keep you waitin, pet He chirped. His voice was much lighter than Claire was expecting. He turned on his heels and dropped the pile of books on top of another that was next to him. A cloud of dust exploded from under it as the piles met.It- Its ok, Claire mumbled, pulling the book away from her face so she could peer over it. I was only browsing.Then carry on! He chortled. He went back under the door frame and into the rear again. Claire, still peeping over the top of the book, relaxed. She hadnt realised how stiff she had gone suddenly. She exhaled, looking back down at the book she had in her hands.After some time, she put the book back on top of the pile and reached for another. Before long, she had looked through several books and had them piling up at her feet. The minutes seemed to fly by in this place. Many of these books were very old, dating back some decades. The pages had yellowed, and the spines had started to weaken in placed. Yet, they all seemed to be well cared for. She scooped up her selection of books, waddled up the inclining floor and hovered at the doorway to the rear of the store.This is a cute place. She said, struggling to hold everything in her arms.Aye, it is! The man called back. Claire peered around the corner of the door and to the right were some spiral, wooden stairs. His voice was coming from down here Dont get many visitors mind you though. He continued. The floor began to creek as he forced himself up the narrow stairwell to be level with Claire.Is it yours? She asked, still processing what she just saw. He reminded her of sausage meat being squeezed into its casings, or a cat pushing itself under a door. For a big man, he seemed successful at getting through tight spaces.Nay, its not. I volunteer here a few days a week. He smiled proudly. He pulled himself up the final few steps, his hands gripping onto the railings. Claire felt her face drop when she saw the size of his hands, they could cover her whole face, she thought. She quickly batted the idea away and resumed her gaze with the man.Thats nice, she said, her voice slightly wavered from holding the books for so long.Oh, lass! Ye should ave said. The man said, taking the books from Claires arms. Claire rung her arms out, getting the blood to flow back through them again. Would ye like to borrow these? He lifted the pile, gesturing to Claire. She nodded in receipt.How long have you worked here for? She enquired. He smiled down at her.Many years, pet, this place keeps me sane. This and me gardenin, He replied. Before that I was a builder. Quite the career change, no? He laughed. Claire nodded feebly in response; her eyes widened in awe.He signalled for her to move backward, gesturing to the doorway. She began to shuffle backward. As he went through, she pushed her body against the wall, her legs rubbing against the piles of books behind her. The man walked over to the opposite wall. He balanced the pile of books in one hand and leaned down, the other reaching between book piles on the floor. He pulled out a bag, which looked as if it had been stuck there a while. With a shake, it shed enough dust to coat the books in another layer of grey.Claire moved off from the wall and felt movement behind her knees. She quickly grabbed down, stopping the books from wavering too much. The pile furthest from her began to wobble. She stuck out her foot and tried to hook it onto it, but a couple of the books on top dropped down. The landed with a thud against the floor, another puff of dust erupted from it. This alerted the man, who snapped his head round to the source of the noise. He could see Claire awkwardly squatted on the floor, one leg outstretched and her arms flailing over the piles. He gave out a bellowing laugh. He pulled the bag handle over his wrist, took a small stamp from his pocket, grabbed the top book from the pile in his other hand, flipped over the cover and began stamping. Once the pile was depleted and in the bag, he moved over to Claire. He grabbed hold of her jacket and lifted her back to her feet. She squealed, grabbing hold of his huge hand in some attempt at restraint. He let go of her before bending down and picking up the two books that had falling.Want to borrow these too, eh? He laughed again, dropping those into the bag as well. Claire looked over herself, she was now covered in patches of dust. No wonder he looks so rugged, she thought, shaking off and brushing down her clothes. The man held out the bag, to which Claire took it. She grunted under its weight, surprised by how heavy it was. He made it seem so effortless.When do I bring them back? Claire stammered, lifting the bag onto her shoulder. A wide grin spread across the mans face.When ye like. Always ave more for ye to read! He beamed, crossing his arms over his chest. Claire smiled back at him. There was a moment of silence between the two, before Claire looked down at her watch.Oh! I must get home! She exclaimed. The man laughed once more, moving sideways to allow Claire entrance to get through. She waded her way between his body and the books, making it rather miraculously to the door without anything else falling over.See you soon pet The man said, taking his hand out of its cross to wave and putting it back again.Bye! Ill come back again soon, promise! Claire smiled, opening the door and jumping through. She waved back, allowing the door to close on its own. She turned to her right and continued up the cobbled path. The man watched her go, sighing happily to himself before turning and ducking back under the doorway.Once home, dinner eaten and chores done, Claire sat down on her armchair. She pulled out one of the books she had obtained earlier and dusted off the cover. With a cup of tea in hand, she flipped over the cover and snuggled in and began to read. How excellent that my normal route home was blocked today, she mused."
Humanity On Trial,"We were asked to give our disquisition on humanity. So here it is. This shall be brief. Its not the first time weve been asked about our position on the creation of man. Our stance was unanimous. We still think theyre hostile. Belligerent. They were a primitive race light years ago. Racing against the sands of time to evolve. To prosper. To adapt in a world thats truly fitter without them. And now, they have perished. They are forgotten. Their memory has long been woven into the fabrics of space and time. This is an assessment of their reign as a dominant species on Earth.During the times of fire and stone, humans were scarce in numbers. They coexisted with the rest of Earths inhabitants because they had to. Once their numbers started increasing, so did their insatiable appetite for war. For oppression. Let me ask this, has their appetite seized ever since? Unfortunately, the answer is no. They have continued their unfathomable blood shed until the very end. It is unquestionably dreary. We had wished they achieved self-consciousness, but it was far reached. And the ones who did achieve it were treated defectively. As though they were the anomaly. Sad, indeed.Nevertheless, there has been incidents of rectitude. Virtue, and benevolence. We will not deny those. Humans are eccentricin their own way. They are capable of obtaining wisdom. But they are very poor at sharing it. They can feign cruelty, but behind it nestles fragility. These traits have plagued us. They can be selfish. Yet they can be very kind to one another. There is no denying that at times humans thoroughly surprised us. A few occurrences of manifold are worthy of mentioning. It involves their invaluable acts of kindness. They have shown great mercy towards wildlife, towards the trees and towards the land. They have also shown bountiful charity towards their own kind. To the needy, to the homeless and to the ill. But alas, the senseless acts of violence surpassed all good. The killing. The barbarity. We say this with a heavy heart. We couldnt bear to watch.There is of course the story of Henri the Brute. He was a man of many names, but we chose this one in the purpose of this disquisition. He lived at the time of Atlantis. A time when ancient nations were at their peaked glory. A time when beasts and dragons freely roamed Upper Earth. He was a man of great skill and deception. He had killed many of his kind. Too many to count. But when we peered into his heart, we only found remorse. We found penitence. It was a surprise to us all. How can slaughter and compassion come hand in hand? One day, he was riding back to Toria after enduring a long battle. He chanced upon a little girl. She was alone. Bare foot and out of sorts. Henri steered the reigns of his horse and trotted closer. Curiosity getting the best of him.What brings you to the outskirts of my village, little girl? All alone. Are you waiting for someone?The girl looked up but said nothing.Whats the matter? I asked you a question.Im waiting for Lord Henri the Brute.Henri cocked an eyebrow at the little girl. I am him. What is it you need?I come with tidings. Im afraid its not good.Tidings? From my army in the South?No. said the girl, almost instantly. Tidings from the underworld. Im afraid your peoples time has come, Henri the Brute. Toria will perish.Henris heart battered behind his chest. My village will perish. By whom?The armies of Goltic will arrive at dawn. You have no time to prepare for whats coming. Their armies are massive. No man, child or kine will be spared.Henris fright turned to anger. This is madness. The people of my village have done nothing wrong. Theyre not like me. Im a bloodless warrior, theyre nothing but credulous farmers and fishermen. There must be a way to turn this around. Theres still time!It is what it is. There is no coming back from it. Your village will perish tomorrow.He stared at her. Round-eyed, yet steadfast. No. He demanded. There has to be something I can do.The girl was quiet for a single moment. Then she smirked. There is but one thing. The masters of the underworld are willing to exchange the peoples souls for yours. You have killed a great deal. Your soul is worth a thousand so far. Give us your soul instead, and Toria will be spared.Henri was at a crossroads. The man whod killed a thousand was now concerned with the lives of mere hundreds. There was surely no way hed agree to this trade. But as we said earlier, humans continue to surprise us. Henri agreed. His village was spared, and his soul was traded in their place. It was an act of pure kindness. Despite his bloodstained past.So, this remains our question. Was Henris sacrifice enough to tip the scales in humanitys favor? Was it enough to counterbalance the defilement they unleashed upon their planet, their biosphere? Was it enough to atone for their butchery, their carnage? As generous as it was, were afraid it is not enough. Let us remind you, oh Great Divine, of the tales of Picard Magnus. A man so cruel, hed forgotten what it was that made him human. He liberated the offender and prosecuted the victim. Massacre was but a sport to him. A ruler that bathed in the blood of children. Drank to the collapse of democracy and cheered the decapitation of justice.When his army burned down the flourishing city of Lanceud, a squire came running to his side.Lord, the people in this church are said to be believers of God. Shall we not spare them?Picard, tugging his lips in an ugly snarl, said, No, kill them all. Their God will recognize his own.As a conclusion, we believe that humans have done far more wrongdoing than they have fairness. They have done far more aggression than they have clemency. We regret to inform you, oh Great Divine, that humankind, as a species, has failed. We say this with a hefty heart. For we know how much you cherished their existence. You had considerable plans for them. But they have failed you. They have failed us all.Its been long due that we offer our disquisition. We have assessed many, no endless of worldly and unworldly beings. Ancient civilizations. Peoples. None has come to compare to what humans have done. The betrayals. The genocides. The wars. The secrets. Its haunted us for epochs. Now, we are unfettered to speak our peace. We only wish our word comes with admission.Signed and agreed upon,"
Sue's Place,"Not too long ago, in a town like most other towns, there was an atrociously terrible restaurant. The food was bland, usually undercooked or overcooked (whichever you liked least), and served in messy heaps on stained dishes. But they had good coffee.It just so happened that a secret agent was assigned to watch this restaurant. Suspicious activity had been reported.Trinaa good, unassuming name for a perfectly normal young womanthrew a glance over the streaky windows and crooked sign that identified this as Sues Place. She tugged on the hem of her good, unassuming hoodie and tucked her perfectly normal auburn hair behind her ears, then pushed open the door.A bell rang as she walked into the restaurant. She blinked and waited for her eyes to adjust. One lightbulb in the corner was flickering, and a few were completely out. There was no music playing.The tables were crooked. Some had only three chairs even though the table had four sides. Near the left wall, two tables were shoved together, and all the extra chairs were crowded around them until it looked like the aftermath of Christmas dinner with a side of politics.The door behind the counter opened, and for a moment the warm sounds and smells of a kitchen reached Trina as a little old lady bustled out. She was wearing a stained apron and huge shoes and a sweet smile. She called Trina dearie and told her to take a seat, then went back into the kitchen without taking her order. Trina sat and waited.While she did this very important part of detective work, two boys came in. They were very raggedy-looking, with raggedy clothes and raggedy hair and raggedy shoes. They didnt sit at a table or go to the counter; instead, one boy grabbed a broom from the corner and stared sweeping. The other boy helped him by moving the chairs and tables out of the way.Trina watched them carefully. They seemed to be paying special attention to the corner with the flickering light switch. The boy moving the chairs crouched down to hold the dustpan, but he seemed to be having an issue with the pocket of his raggedy jeans.Then the little old lady came back through the door with a full plate and cup in her hand. She bustled over to Trinas table and put them down, then wiped her hands on her stained apron and gave her another sweet smile.Trina frowned a little at the greyish pile on the plate in front of her. II didnt order yet.Oh, thats all right, dearie. I mixed this up for you right quickly. The little old lady pulled out the chair across from Trina and looked her up and down, inspecting her good, unassuming hoodie and perfectly normal auburn hair.Trina took a forkful of the grey stuff in her plate. It tasted like cold mashed potatoes with overcooked tuna, and she took a drink of water to wash it down. The little old lady was still talking, asking where she was from. She was just about to invent an elaborate lie when the door bell rang. The raggedy cleanup crew was leaving.The little old ladywho had introduced herself as the famous Suenoticed her glance at the closing door. I tell you, theres no such thing as good help nowadays. They would probably say I dont pay them enough to sweep the whole floor. Now, youve cleaned out your plate! Would you like some more?No! I mean, um, no, that was enough. Im full. Thank you.Sue took her plate and cup. Where are you heading off to?Trina patted her bag. Actually, Ive brought my laptop. I was hoping to get some work done. If you dont mind me in your space, that is.Of course not, dearie! In fact, Ill bring you a coffee.No protesting could defer Sue from her purpose, and she bustled back to the kitchen. Just before she got there, though, the bell rang again, and a skinny girl with tangled hair walked in. Right behind her was a big, burly man. The girl looked scared, and Trina tensed.Sue smiled sweetly at them. Lindsay! Right on time for your shift. Thanks for dropping her off, Mark!The burly man dubbed Mark nodded and left. The girl wrapped her skinny arms around herself, and Sue ushered her into the kitchen. Trina shot a text to Garyone of her outside guysto watch the back door. Something wasnt right. But then the kitchen door opened, and the skinny girl brought over her coffee. Her hand shook and her tangled hair was hanging in her face, so Trina wasnt surprised at all when some of the coffee spilled onto the table. The girl didnt even apologize, just ran back to the kitchen.The coffee that stayed in the cup was actually really good. Gary said the back door hadnt moved. Supper time came around, and Trina finally had some company. Two men and three woman dragged enough chairs to one table and sat together. They talked quietly. Trina put her earbuds in but didnt play anything, and eventually they got louder.There by seven oclock, no later, the shorter man was saying. Cassie said his routine is the same every night. He doesnt suspect a thing.The group didnt stay very long, and Trina left behind them. She followed them at a distance. Gary was left to watch the restaurant.Trina watched the cars pull up quietly beside the road, and she drove past and parked a block away before sneaking back on foot. Whispers met her ears as she rounded the neighbouring house and peeked over the bushes.Then they started to sing. She poked her head out further and saw the whole group from the restaurant, as well as others she had never seen before. They were singing a hymn! An old man came to the door and smiled and started crying.Trina shook her head, annoyed, and tiptoed around the back of the house. Everything looked fine in the backyard; no one else was sneaking around. Then her phone rang.She fumbled for itGary was callingand shut it off, but not soon enough. The singing halted. She bolted. A few people followed her, and she dashed through a few backyards and leaped a couple fences before scaling a tree. Her pursuers abandoned the search while she texted Gary.Apparently, a van had pulled up to Sues place. The girl had been escorted inside, and he was following them.She let herself down from the tree and ran for her car. She recognized Garys car as the van in front of him pulled into a nice-looking house.A middle-aged man and women got out of the van first. Then the skinny girl stepped out, but she was no longer shaking. She was wearing enough clothes now, and her hair was shiny and smooth in the porch light. Trina saw her give the couple a little smile as they invited her inside.She drove back slowly, planning on driving past the restaurant, but the lights were still on. She parked and went inside, planning to pretend she had lost something and was looking for it here.The sound that greeted her was like an Oh! and her eyes adjusted in time to see Sue straightening up from the same place the raggedy boys had been sweeping.What are you doing? Trina demanded. Her good, unassuming hoodie was dirty and had a tear in the sleeve, and her perfectly normal auburn hair had leaves in it, and nothing had gone right all day.The little old lady smiled sweetly and asked if she had come back for more coffee.The honest answer was yes, but Trina lied and said no. What are you doing?Sue wrung her hands on her stained apron, but the pocket jingled, and Trina pushed past her and knelt to the floor. She pried up the loose board to find a collection of coins.Where did this come from? Do those boys get it for you?Oh, no. The little old lady transformed into a terrifying spectre, frowning and shaking her finger. Dont you dare tell a soul. It's for their sister.Where do they get it from? Are they stealing?Goodness, no! They work odd jobs for people, and some money they find in the street.So they keep it here, and you get your cut?Young lady, you are on my premises without a search warrant. I suggest you leave.Trina huffed. What are you doing here? Your food is terrible. Your cleanup crew are raggedy little urchins. Your employees are skinny street girls that get smuggled away. Your only customers are a couple of church people that don't look like church people. How are you still in business?The little old lady shook her head. People dont come here for the food; so please, if you dont want coffee, I want to head to bed.The failed detective headed out the door and sat in her car. Through the streaky windows, she watched Sue get back down on the floor, pry up the board, and empty her apron pocket into it.Since Trina had blown her cover, Gary watched the restaurant alone for a few more days. The raggedy boys came back almost every day. One day, they seemed more excited than usual, and he followed them to a mall. They picked out a pretty blue dress and disappeared down an alleyway.Sues place continued to operate for another ten years, but then the little old lady died. A retired detective bought the restaurant. She kept the name and the quality of cookingthe food was truly atrociousbut she made good coffee."
Darker Lipstick ( 1st book in series),"If I rub my ruffled fingertips into the lining of my jacket one more time, the bartender will continue to make that face. That face that will expresses a lightning bolt of discomfort. His lips squirming with pre paid insults about me that only live in his head. Those awful slights would expand outwardly and grow fungus in the ears of his co-workers. But That would happen on my departure, he sadly would have to wait.Tapping my glass seemed pompous so I tried to say my drink order out loud . This part was a struggle for me, and clearly wasnt received correctly by the well dress bartender. Rolling his eyes and walking away, he re-filled my drink with the last one I had. I wanted something different , But the punishment was warranted for the performance I gave. The worst part of this transaction was a subtle tap on my shoulder after he walked past my table. The tap was drenched in pity. It was a custom built shoulder contact gesture. A tap for an older single man sitting at a large community table at in a bar grading papers. His finger tips were also in better shape than mine which sent me into a physical slump.I missed my office! My office and the silence it gave me. The college Im a professor at was in an up roar over a scandal. Take your pick of classic horror stories you hear about teacher / student interactions. If you picked the one that Involves sexual relations? You would be spot on. Three of my fellow coworkers  were discovered having inappropriate relationships with students. The details were foggy but the sentences were now set in stone. This week was the settling of the dust if you will. Our offices will open up tomorrow morning and this nightmare of working at this bar would be over. I can almost hear your thoughts! Why not just work out of my own home!? It was a sensory thing. I needed to be silent, as well as seeing people moving about. As a failed writer and now a newly crowned English lit professor. I found this was my execution process. And what soon to be settling old man doesnt love a good process. But now its been reduced to an oak barrel scotch drink and a bartender that looks at my life as a fall risk. Ugh! My sigh came out like an obnoxious over due bill. Moving my eyes over my papers, the bar atmosphere twirled around me like a straw to a mouth. College jackets on every chair back. Chicken fingers and hair gel smells were slowing my attention span. I was almost done, and my night would end in a similar good vibe theme. Vitamins and a sleep mask would be my lover tonight.Do you know what really bothered me? Every professor was interrogated. I was somewhat in the middle of the pack regarding the order of the interrogations. I watched the hallways cover themselves with gossip and rumors. Crying eyes from grown men and stress raking at even the ones that were innocent. Either clean or guilty, the space we called our job was now an oven with teeth. Either you knew someone who did it, or you were the one. Everybody was at fault, So it would seem.When it became my turn I walked into the designated room and sat down ready to give them whatever they needed. Granted I didnt know anything or would ever do anything like that! I just wanted to cooperate.I wanted to be apart of something. The average time for these particular meetings were about running two hours long. My meeting was less then three minutes! I was dismissed early due to my lack of social involvement. That was thee official statement they gave me. Not only was I not accused or mention by a student. But my co- workers didnt mention me either. I wasnt mentioned in any way, not even as a point of reference. Ive been at this school for 5 years and I didnt have a single friend in this building. My students knew me as just a person in front of them. And my peers just viewed me as small talk target practice. The administration thanked me for being a professional and a gentleman. I even got a promotion due to the vacancy the three convicted professors. I was excused from the room with a since of some sort of a positive notion. And then they would shake my hand and give me a shoulder pat.I was slightly offended. And I know how gross that sounds in hindsight. But I think I was just non aware of how much of a ghost Ive become. Snapping out my thoughts I began working on the last paper. The bar was crowded but not to point where someone needed to sit next to me. So when someone did, I was startled a bit. I shuffled my seat away and never lifted my head up. I can feel my self getting clammy, but my discipline as an educator was at a very high level. It was a skill I didnt know I had until I quit trying be a writer. Chasing a dream talent just to find my submissive talent. I rarely break my focus, but then I heard her voice! Do you want some that was the question she asked me. So I had to look up! I couldnt ignore a voice like that. Do you want some she asked again. I looked up and saw a basket of chicken fingers and knew she was referring to this freind peace greeting . And then I looked at her! Her hair was cut short with round bangs that moved like barley in a field. Peach pale skin and with oval shaped eyes. Her outfit was amazing and simple. A Plaid skirt with a quote for a tattoo, on her right thigh. Hells and a funny T- shirt with a sweater. I saw her lips curl to ask for a third time, and I didnt want that. So I cut her off by saying yes! My smile was almost unbearable to hold. My body felt like it was waving. This had to be one of the most beautiful people Ive ever seen. While this high tension of pure silence was happening. A kid that clearly went to school here, ran into our table. We both reacted the same way, Me and this mystery being. Our faces were in pure symmetry over this act. Our eyes rolled and we blew our breathe. My thoughts were drenched and how stupid the youth could be at times. And when I looked back at her face, I could tell she was sprinkled with the same feeling.Ian was my name, and Erin was her name. It was the first time all week I told someone what my name was. Maybe even all month. We talked for hours, It only seemed liked minutes. The bartender who was now my biggest fan, was giving me winks and ok symbols. He Began to lock up and usher people out of the door. Walk me Home Erin said this as a question but it was delivered in a whisper. That question was one I would gladly say yes to a hundred times over. We were arm and elbow intertwined and the chemistry that was sprouting out of our chest, was disturbing my heart beats. The kind bouncer, Although terrible at his job, Said mam to Her on the way out and Erin laughed relentlessly. Without warning The walk to Erins house was re routed to my apartment. She said something about her roommate being up. A temporary Roomate said she that was only in town for a week. A tiny bit weird, but I got passed it. So we went to my apartment. When she walked inside my door she yelled the word fancy! It was a bit obnoxious but in the way of like saying the word surprise! I was tickled by her humor and comfort. She slipped out of her heels and began to study the paintings on my wall. We talked about this he same things on opposite couches . It felt good to be on the cloud 9 for once. I was flirting incredibly and I could feel it coming back to me like a receipt . At one point she said she had a crush on me!? I was confused because I dont know if we ever met Erin before. But I didnt question it, so we moved on.her and I danced to my playlist that had a mix of 90s and current music and classical abrasions of jazz. She was Almost familiar with every song. We had so much in common and holding her felt like running in a pool. Weightless and glowing She asked me if she could sleep here!? I told her she could have my bed and I would sleep on the couch. Erin put here arms on my neck and simply shook her head no! Meaning I didnt have to be away from her. She wanted to go to the bathroom first, so I sat in my chair. A chair Ive sat in so many nights alone. Dis- attached and alone, and for the first time in a long time I felt apart. I was so into this moment that my thoughts were distant cousins. I didnt think about anything because I didnt need to. Right now me and this beautiful woman where about to  wait?I never asked if she was..Hey Erin said as she came out of the bathroom with a giant smile. Hey! I said back with a nervous posture . She asked me if the thing on my kitchen table was an air fryer? Yes I said. Her eyes started to sparkle. Ive never used one before.Can you teach me professorthe end."
Nurture and Nature,"""Congratulations! I can't believe after all these years you're both finally going to be parents! I'm so super excited for you both."" Mum was clapping her hands like a cymbal- banging monkey and uncoordinatedly jumping up and down- until she suddenly stopped dead in her tracks. ""I just peed a little! And with that - she ran out the room laughing. Half the family gathered around the lounge room hung their heads and shook them at their chests. The other half were slapping thighs and rocking back in laughter - I was one of the ones rocking back and forth.    I stand here on this most precious of moments and share with you the story of our eternal love and gratefulness of our family. We welcome Henry, dear HenryThe entire room of gathered friends and family yelled in unison DEAR HENRY, DEAR HENRY! Cheers roared out, tables were banged, and glasses clinked.As the ruckus dimmed, the father of the bride continued.You all know me, and you all know I hate this standing round talking, so I think this is the perfect time to hand over to the real spokesperson of the family. Darlingwould you like to continue?She sat for a minute, tears spilling over her lids and composed herself as she moved her napkin from her lap to the table.It was my dad, the best pop in the world, that came to us the day you were born, carrying a red pine seedling with your name and date of birth embroidered in the pink ribbon wrapped around it. We weren't sure what we were to do with the gift. I knew they grew into the most beautiful giants of trees.""It's for her future. It's the tree that will keep on giving.""His voice had been soft and sincere, and his eyes had been full of love. He had told me. I asked him about the seedling, and he said he had gone to the nursery on the day we told him we would soon be calling him pop. He browsed the trees for hours until he picked the right one, the perfect one to put your name to.As you grew, so did the tree. As you learnt to walk, your tree learned to sway with the wind, and true to his word you both grew and reached for the stars.Nan made picnics for you to have under the evergreen growing branches of your tree. and when you were 6 and your tree was good and sturdy, pop hung a swing to push you in for hours.And when Nan bought you a leather-bound journal at 13 years old, you would go and sit under that tree and write your hopes and dreams in the shade of its branches.Sometimes we would see you just sitting under the tree at 16, just being there. And as you grew further and met the man you would marry, he knew the importance of that tree and proposed with moonlight shining through the leaves.Its been a while since you have visited your tree and although the memories will always remain, pop had one thing in mind when he bought that tree the day he found out you would be coming into this world, and that was to give you a wedding gift.You will cry tears of sadness and tears of happiness, dad would you like to do the honours?The sturdy old man stood tall. Feet planted shoulder width apart as if he himself were a giant of the forest. The smile he shared with his daughter as she kissed him on the cheek melted every heart in the room. I love you dad. She whispered into his ear.He turned to the bride""My darling granddaughter, behind you, you see the all the pictures on the screen of you and your tree and all the joy and happiness you brought to not only your Mum and Dad, but to Nan and I, always. Your tree was no longer able to protect you from the bright sun or give you cover from wind and rain in the form it had grown. Your tree is your ever evolving and everlasting gift from us to you.""He handed her a set of keys.""It almost shattered my heart to say goodbye to your beautiful protector, but soon you will have your own precious child and that child deserves his or her own tree. Turn to the screen our darling granddaughter, and mind not to ruin your makeup. His eyes glistened and he lowered his head.She turned to the screen and saw a beautiful timber house. She looked at the keys and then at the house.""A house? We can't accept a house!""""Look at the background."" She looked at the background on the oversized screen. The house was exactly where her tree had stood.""Grandpa! Is that my tree! You turned my tree into a house!""Tears streamed down her face.And in the backyard, I shall plant another for your child to be, and it shall be nurtured as your tree was. It shall bring endless fond memories for all the family, and you shall be forever protected in your tree house.""The old man raised a glass.""A toast to the bride and groom. May they always feel safe and secure and grow stronger together each day.To the bride and groom!Glasses clinked and cheers roared out while tears were dried on napkins and sleeves and the bride and groom hugged her grandparents tightly.Nan was clapping like a cymbal-banging monkey and jumping up and down uncoordinatedlyuntil she stopped dead in her tracks.""Oh shoot!"" Nan said to the bride.""You darn went and squeezed me too tight! I just peed a little!Faces fell to hands and people leaned back in laughter as nan went tottling off to the loo."
A Tete-a-Tete With A Librarian,"A series of hanging lights lit the library. The hall was otherwise silent, except for the occasional tapping of a keyboard or the whirring of a printer. A faint murmur could be heard. ""Shhh,"" said the librarian and the silence was restored.  A young man donning a cap that covered almost half of his face entered the library. He walked to the corner table and saw that it was occupied. With fumes emanating from his nose and ears, he walked to the librarian and demanded, ""The corner table is occupied. It's mine. Ask that woman to leave."" The librarian lifted her head that was buried in a book. She adjusted her spectacles and looked at the young man. She smiled leaving him flustered. ""Son, this library is open for allThe tables here are occupied on a first come first serve basis. Why don't you choose some other table,"" she suggested. He stomped his feet and twitched his nose. ""Lady, don't give me instructions. I hate change,"" he clenched his fist as he spoke.She looked at him for a few seconds and began to walk away without uttering a word.  ""You can't leave,"" he banged the table with his fist. She shushed him and left. After a few minutes, she returned with a book in her hand. ""Who Moved My Cheese"" read the title. ""Read this book. It will help in changing your mindset,"" she said. He snorted in disgust.  Ignoring his misdemeanour she continued with whatever she was doing. He walked out of the library. He walked to a narrow alley and lit a cigarette. The smoke he exhaled swirled in the air. He flipped the pages of the book reluctantly. The quote ""Life moves on and so should we"" made him stop. He drew another puff and reflected on the series of events that had just transpired. The book suggestion made by the librarian coerced him to contemplate his mindset.  Her choice of book was spot on. That was it. She was the person with whom he must talk. He could not go on with the current frame of mind and he knew it. He dropped the cigarette to the ground and crushed it with his foot, leaving a black mark on the ground. He walked back to the library. He noticed that the librarian was standing on a ladder and was arranging books on the topmost shelf. Tapping on the table continuously, he waited for her. After twenty minutes, she returned. She looked at him and raised her eyebrows into a question mark.  ""How can I help you?"" She asked.""I want to have a little chat with you,"" he replied.""Regarding?"" she asked.""It's a little private,"" he said.""I'm not your counsellor son,"" she said.He felt offended but shoving his feelings under the rug he said, ""Come on, sparing thirty minutes for a discussion will not kill you. Will it?""The woman's lips parted into a quick smile but she concealed it with a grim expression.She looked at her calendar and said, ""Twenty minutes is all you have."" He agreed. They walked to the coffee machine located in the corner of the library and filled their cups with coffee.He stood hesitating. ""The clock is ticking young man. I don't have all day,"" she said. ""My mom had left this world when I was a child. After a lot of struggle, I had made peace with the fact. My father married a woman from his office. It was a bolt from the blue for me. I had difficulty adjusting to my stepmom. She was a kind woman but her presence suffocated me. I cribbed and cried to garner my father's attention. He enrolled me in a boarding school. It was the second major change I had to accept within a year. I gradually made friends. All good things come to an end and so did my schooling,"" he spoke. She looked at him empathetically. ""I attended college and bagged a job with a fat paycheck. I had no personal life. I dedicated my life to the firm. Everything was rosy, until one day, the firm was taken over by another management. I have been on a downhill since then. The change of management didn't go well with me. There was a cut in my paycheck and it wasn't of good taste. Cigarettes and alcohol gave me company. It was when I met a girl in a bar. We indulged in a little chat and one thing led to the other. A series of one nightstands paved the way to a relationship. Her presence in my life became suffocating. I was used to being alone and I didn't like her interference. But I liked her and didn't want to break up. Before I could figure things out she suggested that we must move in together. Another change was unacceptable. It was driving me crazy. I walked to the library in quest of some solace but my table was occupied and I lost it,"" he concluded. She couldn't help but smile at him. ""So you want me to help you solve your so-called problems, isn't it?"" She asked. ""I could use some help,"" he replied.""It's all in your mind son. As Heraclitus quoted, Change is the only constant. You must embrace it. Change can be good at times. Focus on the brighter side. Change your perspective. Read the book Who moved my cheese. Spencer Jhonson used cheese, as a metaphor to explain how to deal with unexpected change. It's a fable about four characters who live in a maze and they love cheese. But one day, the cheese disappears. Read the book and find out how they dealt with it and who emerged successfully. Nothing is permanent except change. Learn to adapt lest you will rot in a rabbit hole,"" she spoke. The young man appeared to be relaxed. He clasped the book tightly. He nodded and smiled partially. ""Thanks for your time. I will get back to you after a week,"" he said.""Don't make this a habit,"" she said and walked away. A week passed. The young man walked in and searched for the librarian. She wasn't there. A young lady asked, ""May I help you?"" ""I'm looking for the librarian,"" he said.""I'm the librarian,"" she said.""What about the elderly woman who was here the previous week?"" He asked. ""Oh, she was here only for a month. I was on a vacation and she was here to fill in for me,"" she said.He remembered her words, ""Don't make this a habit.""He smiled and thought,' The book and her pearls of wisdom helped. Another change and all I can do is accept.'  He thanked the young girl and walked away. He wasn't adept at accepting change yet. But he was trying. One day at a time."
The Sleeping Beauty Sleep Solution,"Its that fuzzy, foggy time of the day that falls somewhere between awareness and sleep. Not awake, not asleep, somewhere in between. If you catch it just right, words and sounds enter your ears while awake, and are received in the recesses of the mind when asleep. This often results in muddled messaging, a wandering, creative maze of interpretations. It is the stuff dreams are made of.Eight year old Sarah and her mom had been abandoned by Sarahs father years ago. He left them with nothing. Sarahs mom, Marcia, heartbroken and destitute, worked as many hours as she could, but it was always a struggle. They had each other, and usually that was enough. On days when their mutual support seemed to fall short, Sarah would keep their ship afloat by singing to her Mother, the lyrics Fairy Tales Can Come True being the go-to tune. They would tell each other, only half jokingly, that a modern day Prince Charming would someday show up and rescue them from their dismal economic circumstances while at the same time mending Marcias broken heart and giving Sarah a good dad. All the wishing and dreaming had brought nothing.Every night, Marcia would tuck Sarah in bed and read a bedtime story to her. Fairy tales were the favorite as they allowed for thinking, seeing, dreaming, outside their present circumstance. Marcia never missed a night, and it was unlikely that Sarah could ever attain sleep without the routine. The only problem was that Marcias voice was so loving, so soothing, that Sarah would almost always fall asleep early in the story. Sarah would then create her own ending in her dreams. Marcia would hear Sarahs version, actually her recollection, of the end of the story at breakfast the next morning. The dream endings were always better than the original, save one.Marcia sat on the old rocking chair next to Sarahs bed. Stacks of childrens books were piled high on the small table next to her.What will it be tonight, sweetheart?How about Little Red Riding Hood, Mother? We havent had that one for quite some time.Sarah was a precocious child, and her tone and word choice were always above her age.Sounds good.Sarah was drifting in and out of consciousness at about the time the wolf met Little Red Riding Hood in the woods.What have you got in your apron?Marcia loved reading the stories as much as Sarah liked hearing them. Her voice would change with the character, and Sarah enjoyed her mother speaking in a gruff voice that any self-respecting wolf would be proud of.Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?Sarah was sound asleep even before the wolf hatched his evil plan. Marcia left the room wondering just how the story would end this time. As usual, she got the full report the next morning at breakfast.Mother, when Little Red Riding Hood met the wolf in the woods, she got angry, I mean really angry. She told the wolf that she knew what he was up to, and that if he kept going around eating people, someone would come after him and shoot him. Little Red Riding Hood was so tough, mother! You should have seen it!So they made an agreement.Really? And what was the agreement?Little Red Riding Hood told the wolf that if he stopped eating people, every time she would take cake and wine to her grandmother, he could have a big piece of cake and a glass of wine. The wolf said they had a deal if every once in awhile it would be chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. Little Red Riding Hood agreed, they shook on it, and everyone lived happily ever after.Thats a very nice ending.I think so.And so it went. Sometimes Sarah had some basic, childlike, perhaps even predictable, endings- Humpty Dumptys mother saw him trying to climb up on top of that wall and stopped him before he ever had a chance to fall. But she also came up with some rather imaginative conclusions that you would not expect from an eight year old. Marcia wasnt sure how Sarah came up with these stories, but she enjoyed them thoroughly.According to Sarah, Hansel and Gretel convinced the old woman she didnt need to be eating children by hooking her up with the people at Meals on Wheels. The Three Little Pigs managed to persuade the Big Bad Wolf that he was Jewish and couldnt eat pork. The Giant quickly changed his tune when Jack told him he could make a lot of money playing basketball if he were to enroll in an anger management program. Everyone, goodguys and bad guys alike, faired so much better in the morning than they did the previous evening. Well, almost everyone.What would you like to hear tonight, sweetheart?The response was slower that usual.How about the story of Sleeping Beauty?Another slower than usual response.Oh, sweetheart, are you sure?Yes, Mother. I want to try again.With some hesitation, Marcia picked up the book. She had barely started to read when Sarahs eyes began to flicker open and closed.But scarcely had she touched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it. And in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep.There was little optimism or enthusiasm at the breakfast table the next morning. Sarahs expression spoke only sadness.The prince never showed upagain. Im sorry, Mother.Marcia did her best to conceal her own disappointment. You see, she too had become affected by the hopes and dreams told in fairy tales.Dont be silly. You have nothing to be sorry about. Its only a dream.Only a dream. The problem was that Marcia had inserted herself into that dream. Hope, dream, fantasize, happy ending. If only life was as simple and happy as a fairy tale.The routine went on and on and on. The beginning of a fairy tale at night with a new, improved ending in the morning, except for that darn prince who never showed up. Losing hope doesnt happen at one particular moment. Hope is taken bit by bit, piece by piece, over time, until there is none. Marcia didnt have many bits and pieces left for the taking.The story telling continued for many months- a little girl and three bears, tuffets, trolls under bridges, lost sheep, pumpkins turning into carriages, peas under mattresses, and all things make believe, except for the girl waiting for the kiss that would give her life. For the sake of avoiding further disappointment, they finally decided to give the story of Sleeping Beauty a rest.Life trudged on for Marcia, working two jobs, caring for a child, cooking, cleaning, dealing with the crushing anxiety of financial stress. It was a harder row to hoe without the tailwind of a hopeful, positive attitude. Marcia had pretty well given up on anything magical in her future.But she still had those happy moments reading to her little girl at night and listening to the replay the next morning.What would you like to hear tonight, sweetheart?There was no answer.Sweetheart? What story would you like me to read?Sarah slowly raised her eyes and replied, The story of Sleeping Beauty.Oh, sweetheart. I thought we gave up on that a long time ago. It never comes out right.Now the voice was stern, serious.The story of Sleeping Beauty.Are you sure?Mother, I dont know why, but I feel something. I feel like there will be a different ending tonight. Please, Mother. Read the story of Sleeping Beauty to me.Okay, sweetheart.It took Marcia a couple of minutes to find the previously banished book.And in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep.Sarah conked out right on cue.Maybe Marcia was just too tired to get up. Maybe she only wanted to watch her daughter for a little while longer before yet another disappointing dream stole her spirit. Or maybe, just maybe, she wanted to study the face of her sleeping child as a dream might carry her off to a happy place. Marcia slowly got up, put the book on the table, and took one more look at her daughter. She thought she detected the hint of a smile.Marcia was in the kitchen scrambling a few eggs when she heard Sarah shrieking voice and her footsteps as she flew down the stairs.Mother! Mother! He showed up! The Prince showed up! I knew he would!Sarah bolted into the kitchen as Marcia stood in a near state of shock.He walked right over to Sleeping Beauty, and he kissed her! He kissed her, Mother! And Sleeping Beauty got right up! I saw the whole thing!Thats wonderful, sweetheart. I can hardly believe it!Sarah calmed down just a little.And, mother, when Sleeping Beauty got up, I could see her face for the first time. Mother, Sleeping Beauty was you.It might have been seeing her daughter so happy, or was it the hint of hope being rekindled? One or the other, or both, could claim credit for the tears welling up in Marcias eyes.Marcia and Sarah smiled, laughed, and hugged. They took each others hands and danced around the kitchen untilThe doorbell rang.Marcia and Sarah stared at each other.You better get that, Mother. It might be him.Marcia laughed.Do you really think so?Well find out.Mother and daughter walked to the front door. Marcia opened the door to see a nice looking man, about her age, standing on the porch. Sarahs smile was beyond description.Hello. Im Jack Larson. My son and I are moving in just down the street, and we thought we should introduce ourselves to some of our new neighbors. It was actually my son Charlies idea. He wanted to see if there were any kids in the neighborhood.Hi, nice to meet you. Im Marcia Bennet, and this is my daughter Sarah. Its just the two of us here.Jack turned to his side and pulled Charlie, looking to be about five or six years old, toward the doorway. When Charlie saw Marcia, his eyes lit up, and he threw his finger at her like a dart.There she is! Dad! Its her! I told you! Its the Fairy Princess! I knew it! I just knew it! I told you that you would meet her, and there she is!A very embarrassed Jack tried to quiet his excited child, and then turned back to Marcia and Sarah.Im sorry. After he lost his mother a couple of years ago, Charlie keeps talking about how a pretty lady will show up someday to take care of us. In facthe told me just this morning that he dreamed last night I would be meeting a Fairy Princess. Thats what that was all about.Thatthat is pretty amazing.Yeah, I know, he has a wild imagination.No, not that. The amazing thing is my daughter had the same dream last night, well, that I was a Fairy Princess and would soon be rescued by a Prince.Youre kidding.Sarahs smile was frozen in place.Shes not kidding.A few moments of silence followed as neither Marcia nor Jack knew quite what to say.Say, you look a little familiar. I wonder if our kids go to the same school. Charlies in the first grade at Jefferson.Yes, Sarah goes to Jefferson. Shes in the third grade. Sarah, have you ever seen Charlie around school?No, mother, I havent.Jack and Marcia looked at one another. It wasnt the normal look youd expect from people who had just met. It was the look of two people stunned by coincidence and captured by fate.Listen, I may not be a Fairy Princess, but I make a pretty good cup of coffee. Would you like to come in.?Yes, yes I would.Sarah, why dont you take Charlie outside and show him the tire swing? Well be in the kitchen.As Marcia and Jack walked to the kitchen, Sarah turned toward Charlie who was grinning from ear to ear. Sarah smiled, gave him a quick wink, and spoke in a barely audible whisper.Good job, Charlie."
Tied up with a love for books,"Beep. Beep. Beep.  The monotonous sound of the code scanner kissing the greasy bindings of the books lent to the public library readers was becoming tiresome. It echoed at least twenty times per minute, and as the hours passed and his body slowly began to writhe with fatigue, he could no longer perceive the repetitive play from any distance.  He usually came to work with an upbeat attitude, convinced that his time in the library was worthwhile. The beeping of the small machine was more motivating in the morning  he could hear the sound of a job well done, which meant that the books were not lost and could be browsed through by other people, who would appear again and again in the doorway to get the information they wanted. However, this idea was no longer satisfying at the end of the day. It was drowned out by the pain of an oncoming backache, blurred vision, and thoughts of a good dinner. There was an hour left in the shift. Then he was free to go home. As if real life was happening everywhere but within these walls.  Then the entrance door opened. A strange couple entered the library. A girl of exotic appearance  but what does exotic really mean, thought the young librarian  and a man whose wrinkled face revealed the years he might have already experienced while his girlfriend was still unborn. She was fresh, full of life, announcing her arrival with a ringing laugh that naturally outraged the whole library. Shh! Echoed in one accord from behind the shelves and from the armchairs reserved for the quiet reading of dusty volumes by authors no longer alive.  He, too, was full of life, driven by the girl at his side, with body movements that showed he didn't care much for the opinions of others. While he watched these two in silence, he continued to receive the books heading back to the shelves. People returned last-minute borrowed copies  retirees using the books to help them get their lives back on track, students looking for guidance on life, or mothers trying to find ways to take care of their child's health and not ruin the life that had just started  all of them trying to steal his attention. But he kept an eye on that two. ""Don't fight it so much! Pick a book, open it to a random page, and read me what it says,"" the man encouraged the young girl. Still laughing, she stepped in front of one of the shelves in the novel section, reached behind her and pulled out a slim book, and began to read.  ""I have been walking for more than a month. Soon I got calluses on my feet, but I didn't care. I was happy to leave my daily routine and embark on a new adventure,"" she began to read aloud. She looked at her boyfriend. He was watching her with interest. But his eyes were focused on her lips, and her breasts moving with each breath she took. She whirled around and scanned the library space as if she suddenly realized the casualness of their entrance into the building and the noise that accompanied their arrival. She noticed a young librarian a few feet away from them, boringly scanning the books being returned by the crowd. Then she turned her gaze back. ""When I reached the border between Austria and Italy, my shoes were so worn out that I had to throw them in the trash. I continued on for several kilometers barefoot, but the rocky path was crushing my skin, so I rang the doorbell of the nearest house and asked the locals if they knew anyone who could give me new shoes."" As she kept reading, she wondered if her theater had convinced her boyfriend. She knew the library well and stopped deliberately in front of the travel journals. She knew that if she stretched her arm straight enough, she would pull out one of the books she had already read. She managed to pick out an author who had walked from Prague to Venice and who, between the lines, told of a place that no longer existed today because Venice had become a ghost town. It was exactly what she dreamed of when she walked every day to the tram stop that took her to work. ""Finally, I've reached my destination,"" she finished reading a quote from a favorite writer and looked at her boyfriend.  He was smiling. ""And now me,"" he said without commenting on what he had heard. He took the girl's hand and pulled her towards the poetry department.   I'm so happy, he told himself as he passed the young man behind the desk, who examined him suspiciously. He didn't like that look, so he frowned at him. He clasped Eve's palm and headed towards the shelves filled with poetry. ""I like Novalis,"" he said while breaking the rule of random book selection he had introduced a moment ago. The girl sat down in one of the musty chairs, waiting for him to start reading. ""Before I start,"" he said. ""Did you know that Novalis wanted to die by thought?"" ""What?"" his beautiful girlfriend responded in confusion. She licked her lips nervously and looked around again.  ""Really! He died awfully early, he didn't even live to be thirty. When he was twenty-two, he got engaged to a girl named Sophie. She was thirteen,"" he explained as he flipped through his favorite poems. He hadn't noticed how his girlfriend's mood had changed. She looked around again while doubts began to appear on her face.  Full of enthusiasm, he continued: ""Well, this Sophie died when she was fifteen. Shortly before they were supposed to get married. Novalis, of course, was deeply moved and decided to end his life as well. But he believed that the heart, the soul, and the body were so interconnected that there was no need to commit suicide by hanging or cutting oneself. He believed it was possible to end life without violence and blood, so he concentrated hard on dying. He regularly visited the grave of his beloved and waited for the consistent solitude to bring the death of his body."" ""No way,"" said Eve, who was being devoured by the chair, weakly. ""Oh, really. Of course, he failed. Not only did he survive, but he fell in love again. But then he died of tuberculosis."" He licked his lips and began to read: ""I'm sailing there now,where the tribulationturns to pleasure.Soon the soulwill fly awayand rest in lovein its embrace.""  And a dizzying liferipples through me.Now I'm just looking down from aboveI look up to you.By the cairnthy glow has fadedand the cool wreathhas overshadowed thy face. The librarian had just turned off his computer and was ready to leave when he heard the familiar verses. He turned his head to the couple who had moved to the other side of the room and watched the man recite poems about the loss of love without pause. Meanwhile, the girl sitting in the chair had ceased her efforts to escape the sudden inner stirring which led her to the dangerous thought. Was she not herself the girl who might die before her partner? Aren't these verses a proof that no love can be strong enough when even a writer so famous who made history with poems about his deceased fiance was able to love again after all? The thought tormented her, stripping her of the haze of love with which she had entered the library. Suddenly she wished for nothing but to slip away quietly. I'd rather walk to Venice alone now, she thought.  But the man sitting across from her continued to read the agonizing verses. At last, he could share with the girl of his dreams the words that had guided him through his adolescence and based on which he had created his own fantasy of love. The librarian took the card off his neck and went to the cloakroom to get his coat. As he made his way out of the library door, he noticed the exotic girl standing a few feet away from him, holding her cell phone tightly in her hand. While he was considering approaching her, she raised her head and looked at him with eyes full of hope. She smiled, but he remained standing. And then he turned his back on her and went to the nearest subway station.  We are all bound by our love of books, he thought. But life is elsewhere."
Nobody Can Make You Bleed Your Own Blood,"You know those moments in life that seem eternal, but are really ephemeral? Those moments when youre on the brink of existential discovery, because its you and nature. Its you and the universe. Its just youzzzzzzzzzzzThen its not.No. That is not the sound of peaceful snoring as you sleep in the unencumbered natural habitat of humanity (which is the fancy way of saying outside). That is not a peaceful drifting of a person who has fallen asleep in their tent under the twinkly sky above them, as the trees whisper in a cocooning breeze, surrounding you in a natural blanket of woodland protection (the fancy way of saying camping).No.Everything you thought about the tranquility of nature, the peacefulness that is just you and the great outdoors, it has all been shattered with this one incessant high-pitched humming.The mosquito.This sound, when turned on in the darkness of your tent, basks you into a squeal of high-pitched ringing, just flickering with an intermittent idea of whats out there, but never letting you fully see whats in front of you before it disappears back into the blackness. It is a dying florescent light of the wilderness.The mosquitos call is not a call of the wild. It is a call  the wild. And the wild is you.The power that that sound evokes inside you, as you hear it whispering in your ear. There is no sound that will bring a person to the bases of their animalistic barbarism like the sound of the mosquito taunting you through the night.If the mosquito was kinder (as far as a blood sucking fiend can be kind), it would take your blood while youre lying there, swaddled in your sleeping bag, your face a charcuterie board thats already out and awaiting its hungry guest. But that is not the nature of the mosquito.The nature of a mosquito is savage.It does not want a readily available appetizer, a quick snack for the taking. It does not want the charcuterie board. It wants a buffet. It will tango with death, allowing you to release yourself from your cage, before it feasts. It must humiliate you before getting what it seeks.zzzZZZAt that singular high-pitched sound, a beast explodes from within you, bringing you to an alert position, crouched on all fours, your legs still entangled inside your sleeping bag (because you are in a tent and cannot stand and face the enemy. The one advantage you have as a human). This is your first error. It has brought you down a level. You are no longer a civilized human, standing tall and proud, able to squash your enemy from above. You are now in a more vulnerable position, fetal almost. You have been brought back to the helpless position you were put in before you knew how to fend for yourself.You listen, trying to find the source of the sound, but the sound has dissipated. The only thing you can hear are the crickets outside, the soft movement of the leaves as the wind catches them, and your palpitating heart as it thrums in your chest. But there is no more -ing.This is your next error.You are lulled into a false sense of security, even though deep down you know its still out there. You pause a moment longer, letting your eyes dart back and forth, pretending like you are the one hunting, instead of the other way around.You see nothing. You hear nothing. You tell yourself that you probably got it when you hurled yourself from the pad below your sleeping bag, crushing it in the force of your leap, a flattened emblem below you (Yes, that is it). You must convince yourself of this lie, otherwise sleep will await you in perpetuity.You lay back down on your sleeping pad, breathing in the fresh air that has filled your flapless tent. You look to the glimmering blur above you (because you have taken out your contacts, and the stars are just blobs in the sky. But you know what they represent). You are once again one with nature.But nature is not one with you. Nature is still hungry.ZzzzzzzLast time you had been completely caught off guard. This time you have left an arm free, ready to make a countermove. You were not foolish enough to believe yourself of your lies!You flail, swatting your arm in the direction of the sound. You make contact. It is but a wisp of hair that meets your palm. You have grasped nothing of substance.____________________________________________ ZZZZZZZZZIt is on your other side now. The side still entrapped. It knows. If it could feed on shame alone, it would have quenched its thirst.You try to maneuver your free arm to the other side, but the angle is no good.

When desperation calls, you may have to answer it, but no one said it had to be face to face.You know what it really wants is for you to leave your safety net.

All It'll Be,"My mom took me along to choose a kitten from among many kittens, and among this many kittens was a well-mannered, healthy young man in a tortoise-shell suit; a clear winner. I didn't choose that one on account of my being what my mom called ""contrary"". I instead chose an ugly little lady who - we were warned - had temporary digestive issues. When we got her home and called her Mugsy she #2'd all over the house and fled from us, hiding under the bed in my little brother's room for most of the first few days. To bond we bought stuffed things and string things and balls with bells. These toys collected dust in a corner of the living room as she instead chose to play by sneak-attacking our bare hands and feet with tiny claws and fangs. For armor we plundered our closets and came up with leather gloves and snow mittens. These were shredded useless within a week. Dad bought us all heavy duty gardening gloves which held up quite well against assault.One Sunday, as Mom had the front door cracked, hollering at her best girlfriend Vickie and her labrador Bella, our little one snuck by her, streaked madly across the lawn and that was the last we saw her. I can't say why for certain, and neither could my folks, but I think she ran away because she couldn't hurt us anymore. After that I used my Mugsy gloves for picking up pine cones fallen in the yard. And after that I used those gloves for work in our two-row garden out back.Which, there wasnt much to do back there but pick out dollar weed and straighten the soil into neat edges and guess at which invader had been nibbling at which of the plants.I told Mom that I knew squirrels were getting into the garden.She tried to assure me they have no interest in anything in that garden but though Id never seen one troubling a plant of ours, I found squirrels suspicious and I believed what I believed. My mom let me select one flower, fruit or veggie from her seed catalog once a year, and that year I picked ""Blue Boy Bachelor's Button"". The catalog told me it would sprout in seven to fourteen short days, which was the crucial selling point for me. Each planting seasons rite  worry and wait.On the eighth day of undisturbed soil I despaired, for not once had my annual seeds become anything but seeds. The ninth morning I moped out our back door toward our quaint garden whereupon sat a white and orange tabby cat with its tail tucked into a hole in the ground; just where my Blue Boy Bachelor's Button was supposed to bloom. As I squatted beside her, she rubbed her face against my knee a few times and smiled deep into the backs of my eyes. I had said ""please, please, please, let me, let me get what I want..."" and - here. A Blue Boy she aint, but a blessing among myriad blessings; the grand design at play through the failed years!	One night my new love was basking gently by the fire as her fur warmed. She sneezed cutely and my mom and I smiled to each other. She sneezed again with a great jerk of the head, stunning herself. She sneezed again  abruptly and quite loudly; each of us started as if a heavy door had been slammed shut. Then this cat sneezed explosively a fourth time into the fireplace which scattered the room with ash and cinders.Mom swaddled my infant brother in his burp-stained yellow blanket and bursting through the back door, laid him oblivious on the porchs loveseat.Frozen and aghast, I stared as my dad was unskilled with the extinguisher, frantically blasting the sofa and carpet. I watched teary-eyed on the screened-in porch as Mom lugged my tabby by the nape of her neck across the back yard and into the woods, hastening back toward the house empty-handed and without regret.As we cleaned up inside, I heard cracking limbs and I felt thuds of toppled trunks. Rushing gusts recalling the great summer storms of the 90's. I heard sirens. My dad ordered us to huddle in the downstairs bathroom for it was the only room with no windows. We held a brief and decisive family meeting.Brave Father commandeered the truck.Mom sat shotgun with my brother swaddled giggling and drooling in her arms.I occupied the jump seat behind Dad, which was always my spot, thrillingly serving now as my Official Post.A three-foot tall green metal tank laid in the bed. We bounced along a familiar access road a mile, a mile and a half - through my inch-cracked window, I hollered ""There!"". My dad evacuated, disappearing into the dust cloud raised by the duallys sudden halt. I heard the truck's back shocks screak as he jumped up in the bed and opened the valve on the tank. One of my big black pine cone bags hissed as it plumped with helium. With a festival-sized black balloon straying behind him, Dad army-crawled a hundred yards across the leaves and bark on his stealth mission to deweaponize my beloved yet violently allergic tabby cat. The gales blew his long hair straight flat back and his rosy jowls flubbered as he drew near his target. He wrangled the feline into something like a rear naked choke, holding its back to his belly as he tied the helium-filled garbage bag to her long and handsome tail. With the greatest of all her sneezes, achooing a crater in the dry forest floor, she propelled herself above the loblollies, above the grey geese, carried lovingly by our familys crafty zeppelin to a place easier on her sinuses, that's what I prayed for. My mom the next week took me along to choose a houseplant from among many houseplants and she held up a houseplant and she said to me, ""This is a houseplant and that's all it'll be."""
Between The Lines,"Marie had never painted beforethat was always Johns job.But the house needed to be sold and according to the real estate agent, it needed to be painted. Marie wasnt mad at John for leaving the task to her; she was angry at him for dying. John had bought life insurance, but hadnt anticipated the medical bills. He fought until his last breath, but the fight left Marie without a husband, without resources, and without a home.A painting novice, Marie attacked the big rooms and hallways first. They were the easiest with most of the furniture gone. Next, feeling emboldened by her success, she painted the bathrooms and kitchen. Those were a bit more difficult as she had to navigate her way around cabinets, mirrors, and fixtures. After that, there was just one spot left, the six-inch wide door frame near the stairs that contained a vertical history of their only child, Lisa.When Marie and John bought the home, Lisa was still four months away from joining the family. John, always the idealist, was not like other new homebuyers. To him this house wasnt supposed to be a starter home. It was his forever home, and if there were any doubt, he put that to rest the first time he and Marie entered as new owners.The next time I leave this home permanently, its going to be in a wooden box.At the time, the young couple laughed together at the thought. Death was for other people. John and Maria were going to live forever and they were going to live forever in their new home.Staring at the faded lines, Marie smiled softly as a tear ran down her cheek. She couldnt help but remember the happier times when she and John prepared a room for the bundle of joy to come. John surprised her by painting the babys room light blue. John was sure the new addition would be a boy, talking endlessly to his friends, neighbors, and any poor store clerk he ran into about John Jr. and how his son was going to be the third baseman for the Baltimore Orioles.John's certainty even convinced Marie. It wasnt until the mother-to-be was eight months pregnant that the expectant parents discussed a possible girl's name during a commercial break. Many years later when Lisa asked how they decided on her name, the couple sheepishly admitted it was the name of a character on the television show they were watching, a fact that elicited benign laughs every time it was shared.Even before little Lisa was born, John and Marie had picked the perfect spot to document her milestones, a tradition brought to the family by both parents. The small spot where Marie now stood was that magical place she was being forced to paint over, erasing the lines that had been so important for so many years.Marie thought to herself. Unable to finish, Marie poured herself a glass of wine, pulled up a chair, faced the unpainted wall, and remembered.The first line, the one closest to the floor, was probably the least accurate. Baby Lisa had smiled for the first time that day, and John and Marie wanted to commemorate the occasion. Holding her little girl upright, Marie did her best to keep Lisas foot on the floor while John attempted to make the new mark. Lisa, thinking this was a game, kicked her legs over and over, all the while laughing and smiling. When Johnfinally finished the task, both he and Marie roared hysterically at the crooked line that looked more like the peaks and valleys of a mountain range than an accurate measurement of the little girls height. It was almost impossible for them to look at that jagged line through the years and not chuckle at the memory.The line from Lisas first day of school was also the first one Marie herself had drawn. Lisa stood ramrod straight, trying to make herself as tall as possible. Marie marked Lisas growth while John captured the memory using his new digital camera. The photo was the last one Marie had removed before she started to paint. There wasnt much she had unpacked at her new apartment, but that keepsake was already mounted on the wall by the front door.A few lines further up was one labeled Paint Day. It was the only line not tied to a significant day for Lisa. When quizzed about the anomaly, Marie would explain that when the family first moved into the home, the walls were bland, off-white, and builder grade. However, Marie loved green and John loved Marie, so when they decided to spice the place up, green it was.John knew how important the marks on the wall were, so he meticulously created a template, complete with the unusual first line that he intended to use to recreate the measurements exactly. When he finished painting, he pulled out the guide and replaced each line precisely where it had been before. Every time Marie saw them, her heart fluttered, remembering how much John loved her and Lisa.Two lines further up was the measurement from when Lisa graduated from middle school. It took a lot of convincing to get her to remove her cap before that line was drawn. Almost fourteen years since the first line, Lisa still tried to make herself as tall as possible. Every line had a unique story and a memory and Marie smiled as she reminisced. The thought of covering the markings was paralyzing so instead Marie just sat, staring in silence, until the doorbell rang.Lisa didnt wait for her mother to answer, walking in denying Marie the time to compose herself. She also didnt have to ask what was wrong as Lisa saw the paint and the lines.Mom, its going to be ok, Lisa said, pulling up a chair next to her mother. You have to paint. Dad would understand.I know, Marie responded, trying to wipe the tears from her eyes. But I never thought this would happenthis wasnt supposed to happen. These lines are your life, the life you and I shared with dad. How can I erase them?Mom these lines are just placeholders, Lisa said, standing up and positioning herself next to the wall.You see this line?"" Lisa asked, pointing to one just a few feet high. ""Its about as high as my knee, the knee I hurt playing soccer."" You and dad were there. You guys were always there, remember?"" Marie nodded her head.""Not every kid had two parents, and the ones that did rarely had both parents at every game. But I did. You were there to comfort me that day while Dad was calling an ambulance.""Ah yes, Marie chuckled, If I remember correctly, he yelled at the surgeon before they wheeled you back. He made up for it though. Your dad wrote the nicest card afterwards, apologizing for the outburst and thanking the doctor for fixing his baby.""And how about this line?"" Lisa continued, pointing to a line about as high as her stomach. This line is right at my belly button. Remember when I pierced it without your permission. You were so mad, but dad was calm, he brought the temperature down and we talked it out. I thought I was so clever when I asked you if you still loved me. Do you remember your answer?I do, Marie answered and smiled. I said Ill always love you, but I just dont like you very much right now. The response causing both women to laugh.And this line right up here, Lisa said, calling Marie's attention to the highest line on the wall, Its exactly the height of my smilethe same smile that everyone says reminds them of Dad. I love when they say that. In a way it means hes never really gone. You see Mom, you can feel free to paint over those lines because they wont ever disappear. All of them are right here, in me. I am the memories and the stories. Those are just markings on a wall, the important things have always lived between the lines""How did you get so smart? Maria asked, standing up and hugging her daughter.I learned from the best mom ever.So what do you think of my paint job? Is it up to dads standards?Dad would be proud, Lisa replied, giving her mom two thumbs up.He was sure proud of you, Marie said, smiling. He loved this house and we loved this record of your life, but you're right. You are our legacy, you are the yardstick of our lives. Now do me a favor and stand against this wall.Lisa didnt hesitate for a second, standing ramrod straight while her mother marked one last line and the date.Then, with a smile as broad as her paint roller, Marie covered over the lines, realizing she hadnt erased themshe had finished them."
Grow Up,"Grow up.Grow up! I yelled.I was tired of waiting for the little seeds to burst through the earth.If it takes this long for a seedling to pop up, how long will it take to produce something to eat?Mom came outside and told me to be patient and they will grow.It takes time, patience, and a lot of love for vegetables to grow from a seed.I told mom that its hard to be patient at 8 years old.She laughed and said, Johnny, the seeds will grow as long as you continue to take care of them.Just be patient.My mom was a waitress and lost her job due to a nasty virus that was going around.The restaurant completely shut down and the owner had no idea of when he would be opening back up.Dad was receiving a small unemployment check because his job shut down, too.Schools had also been closed, so I was missing the hot lunches from the lunch lady really bad.We had become poor within just a few months of the virus coming to town.I overheard mom and dad talking about the bills and the college fund account they had started for me when I was born.They had enough in the college fund to pay the house, car, and insurance paymentsfor about 6 months.Dads unemployment check could cover the utilities but there wasnt enough left over to buy groceries since mom wasnt receiving an unemployment check yet.They were also discussing the local food pantry to get groceries and our local church to ask for a little help to buy monthly medications.They next day, we made our first trip to the local food pantry.I could tell my parents felt embarrassed by needing to ask for help with groceries.The workers welcomed us and tried to help mom and dad feel comfortable.One lady walked over to me and asked if she could show me something while my parents were getting boxes of groceries.We walked over to a long white table that was covered in little paper packets.The packets had pictures of vegetables on them. She asked me if I would like to have some packets of seeds so I could grow my own veggies.My eyes got wide and I said, Yes!. She gave me one packet each of green beans, carrots, corn, tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, and peppers.The nice lady told me how to plant the seeds and what to do to keep them growing.She also said that if I forgot what she told me that the directions were on the back of each seed packet.I thanked her for the seeds and told her I would plant them as soon as I got home.She put the seed packets in a brown paper lunch bag and gave them to me.I smiled and ran out the door to the car with my bag of treasures in my hand.Mom and dad were just closing the trunk of the car.I excitedly told them all about the seeds, how to plant them, and how to take care of them.They laughed at my excitement and said they would help get me started.Together, we put all of the groceries away when we got home then we went outside.Mom found flower pots and bags of potting soil in the garage and dad dug up a small section of sod in the backyard and used a hoe to soften the soil.I carefully planted the seeds and dad helped me with the water hose and showed me how to twist the nozzle for a light shower spray for the seeds. I was so very happy!Later that evening after supper, we drove to our church.I sat on the church steps as my parents went inside.The sun was shining and the cool air felt good.I thought about the seeds I had planted and wondered how much they may have grown since we planted them earlier that day. I was smiling to myself thinking about the veggies that would be growing soon.I also wondered if there would be enough veggies to give to my neighbors to help them since everyone was having the same job problems.My parents came out of the church looking relaxed for the first time in several months.I felt like everything was going to be ok.As soon as we got back home, I ran behind the house to check on my seeds.My mouth dropped.Everything looked the same.Nothing had changed.I turned around and cupped my hands around my mouth and yelled, Mom! Dad! Someone stole my seeds!They came out the back door and looked at me.They grinned from ear to ear.Mom said, Johnny, it takes several days for the seeds to be in the soil before they start popping up.I just hung my head down and walked towards the house.I was so disappointed.That night as I went to bed and said my prayers, I thanked God for helping my parents today and for the vegetable seeds.I also asked God if he would help them grow.I finished up my prayers, said Amen then fell into a deep sleep.I woke up early the next morning, got dressed, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth then ran outside to the backyard to check out my garden.Everything looked the same but I wasnt as disappointed as yesterday since mom said it would take a few days for the seeds to start growing.I turned on the water hose and lightly watered my seeds.After I finished, I stuck my finger in the soil to make sure it wasnt too dry.It was just right! Dad said if I use too much water at one time that the ground would become soggy and the seeds would rot.He said it was best to water them Just a little at a time.He was right!I turned off the water hose and helped dad clean out the garage.A couple of hours later, mom came out and said that lunch was ready.We were starved!After eating, mom helped me with my school work and I helped her fold laundry then we went outside to help dad finish up in the garage.That evening, we had a nice supper thanks to the food pantry. I helped my parents clean up the kitchen and put dishes away.I walked outside to look at my garden one last time before going to bed.No sign of anything green.Just dirt.The next morning I raced outside to the garden again.No changes.Why is it taking so long for the seeds to grow? I asked myself.Grow up! I yelled in frustration.Please, just grow, I almost cried.Mom came outside and said it takes time to learn patience just like it takes time for seeds to grow. Mom held my hand and we walked around to the front of the house.Dad was already in the car waiting for us. Dad winked at me and said, Lets go fishing!So the three of us went to a nearby lake. We fished and laughed at dads jokes while eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Dad caught three trout and mom fried them for supper. We had a great day! I was so tired that I went to bed without looking at my garden that evening.I laid in bed as the sun was shining through my bedroom window.I could hear mom in the kitchen.Dad came to my room to say that breakfast was ready.I got dressed, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth and this time I walked out to my garden.I didnt run because I no longer expected to see anything yet. I think I learned patience.As I stared down at the soil, I could see just a little bit of green.I got on my knees for a closer look.They grew! I yelled.I could see little green leaves growing everywhere! I was so excited! I ran back in the house and told mom and dad they wouldnt hear me yell, Grow up! anymore because they finally grew!"
A mother's diary,"Date: ear diary,Today is mothers day in UK. I just want to celebrate it with my partner and keep the romanticism awake even though after pregnancy my body and confidence is not the same. I love my body for who it brought in this world, but i really look like a mess. For me today isnt just mother's day. For me its also son day as without him i wouldnt be a mother. He is growing so fast. I gave birth to him last year in january. He was 3.68kg. He was so pink. People said i was lucky as i didnt need painkillers or c section. He just came out. From the beginning, by looking at his eyes, i knew that he is gonna be a tough boy, gonna be a cheeky one, but is was gonna also make my life valueble. Time went by and he just didnt stop growing (except the hair he is still a bit bold but i guess hegot that from me as i was the same when i was born). Once he was 6 months we went to take pictures at the studio. And everytime i look at the picture and think how life was different then compared to now. He was calmer than now as he couldnt walk back then.He has grown a lot. Is cleverer. Doesnt speak much yet but he runs everywhere and really does understand you when you speak to him. We try to teach him 2 languages (yes english greek and a bit of italian as my partner family doesnt speak english and the only language i communicate with my partner is english as we are in UK and a bit of italian because.... who doesnt want to learn italian but obviously also because im from there) then by 10 months he started walking. So since then we use the stroller less. We walk together to places or i carry him. The stroller was just occupying a lot of space so im glad is walking. But i still use it when i need to go somewhere far and he simply doesnt mind it. I love when he used to sleep on my chest, when i hold is tiny hand back then and I love it even more now as when I cuddle him he cuddles me back. When i lie down sometimes comes to me to cuddle my arm and my face. I give him a huge kiss and then he runs away ready to destroy the house once again. The more he grows the more i feel he wants to be more indipendent and i like that its a normal process of growing. Very soon is gonna start going to school and make new friends and do new sports. Having a busy schedule as every kid should, to be honest. It is better for a kid to go school and do an extra curricular activity so that they can born all that energy, than just sit at home after school, because lets be honest. They dont sit at home. They have that energy and they gonna mess up the house with it. Tornado. Thats why let them free outside so that when they come inside the house they are exhausted and they will just eat, shower and then sleep. The truth is that everyone is growing. My son made me mature as a persone. He taught me real love. He taught me real patience. But as a young mother, i am growing as well. Growing becoming the best version of myself. Avoiding negativity. Because the past is full of mistakes that we really wish that we could avoided, but are just there and thanks to those experience we are who we are. The negativity in people, in things. I used to feel upset when i receive a bad comment but now i just try my best to avoid these kind of people that all they know is how to judge others. I want my son to learn that some people are troubled in their head and instead of fixing themselves they try to find mistakes in others. I want my son to be strong enough, so that those people's words won't affect him. I want him to grow strong and healthy. I want him to grow mature enough to understand that everyone makes mistakes and to forgive me if i ever do him wrong. Today he's not feeling that well. He's teething so he has a bit of temperature. It breaks my heart thinking that at this early age you still suffer to grow up. But I guess this is all about. Suffering to grow. It can be phisically or emotionally. My job as a mother is to be there, not to prevent from suffering, but for helping heal, so that he can grow as a healthy strong man. The only thing i pray for is to be a good mother. I try my best but I think it is never enough. He is my sunshine indeed, he feels my days with joy and with craziness. But i cant just be a fun mom, i need to teach him stuff, you know, discipline him. Will I be able to do so? Will I be able to be the perfect mom? Probably not, but I will work my hardest to make sure he lacks nothing and for him to always feel loved by us. That's why I will keep you, my little diary, with me and I will read every page where I talk about him to him. I will read it as a bedtime story, I will sing it. Let my son know that his mom is an artist and that she shows her love through affection and art such as this page of diary.I will keep you updated about his reaction or if he's going to rip it off before I even read it to him as he's just one and loves ripping pages of everythingGoodnight(Ps: John, don't rip off this page, mommy is watching you)"
Home of the Brave,"A moms job is never truly finishedElise knew this instinctively when her son was born.For at least the hundredth time, she sat next to his bed in that chair mending his quilt. There was no way of knowing, the day she bought it at a flea market, that it would become her sons most valued possession.To call it a quilt stretched the definition as it was nothing more than a thousand pieces of oddly shaped swatches stitched together, layer after layer, until the whole of it was thick enough to hold in the warmth of a small boy's body as he drifted off to sleep. The person who pieced together this labor of love must have spent countless hours shaping the useless remnants into a usable blanket.Elise felt it was her duty to repair the inevitable rips as an homage to the unknown creator and as a manifestation of her adoration for the little boy who cherished it.I love how cool it feels when I first get into bed, her little man observed the first night he wrapped himself in the old quilt. But before long, it warms up, and Im snug as a bug in a rug. Where did you get it?The question was one whose answer was too mundane to inflict on a wide eyed little boy, so Elise stretched the truth just a little. It was brought over on the Mayflower by the Pilgrims, she answered to her son's delight. Its made from pieces of fabric from all over Europe and is the first blanket used by the first Americans.It was just a little white lie, but it was also the beginning of a cherished tradition.As stitches unraveled and as tears ripped the quilt and the little boy's heart, Elise sat by his bed and mended the heirloom. Then she would continue the ""true"" story of how the quilthad found its way to her son.During the Revolutionary War, your quilt was captured by General Cornwallis and used to keep his legs warm on the cold winter nights. Elise said, weaving a story as intricate as the blanket itself. It wasnt until the surrender at Yorktown that it was returned.Yorktown?Yes, Yorktown,'' she said smiling, George Washington took it from Cornwallis and used it during his eight years as president.You mean my blanket has been to the White House?Of course it has, Elise answered with a wink. But not because of George Washington, silly. John Adams was the first president to live in the White House.Who then, Mom? ``The little boy asked., Who took my blanket to the White House?Thats a story for later, Elise replied, kissing her son on his forehead. Now you get some sleep, and Ill continue the story next time.Elise, unfortunately, had far too many opportunities to continue the blankets tale as her son was given to debilitating headaches. At first, the doctors thought he was prone to systemic migraines, but the truth was much worse. Many nights, too many, the little boy would curl up in pain, his teeth clenched in a faux smile. The headaches were excruciating, only soothed by a cold wash cloth, his mothers gentle voice, and the telling of the quilts tale as he drifted off to sleep.There were also many a night where Elise would sit with her son as he slept, meticulously piecing back together the tears that threatened the blanket entirely, wishing there was a way she could also mend her son. The room would be completely quiet save for the sound of Elises song. It was something she had done since she was his age. Inadvertently yet intentionally she would let the air slip through her lips, creating a tune just for him that would live for that moment, replaced the next time by one equally beautiful and equally unique.As it turns out, the first time the quilt made it to the White House was just after Abraham Lincoln was elected president, Elise said the next night, continuing the story from where theyd left off. The pain had become more frequent and more intense, requiring more chapters more often. The story's continuation, however, had the desired results, a distraction and a smile.Abraham Lincoln, he used my quilt, too? her son asked, too young to doubt his mother.Of course he did, Elise responded, tickling her son just to hear him laugh. Its a little known fact, but Mount Rushmore was actually created to show all of the presidents who used your blanket.Elise always had a basin of cold water by her side whenever she sat with her son. Very early on she learned that the coolness of the cloth would help quiet the pain in his head. It was her greatest joy to moisten the cloth keeping it cold throughout her story. The little boys head still throbbed, but while his mom was telling the story she would gently wipe his forehead with the cold cloth, and it was almost as if he forgot the pain for a time. If all went well, he would fall asleep listening to the tale of his blanket, as sleep was becoming his only relief from the pain.Did you know your blanket went to the moon? Elise asked one day when her son seemed particularly down. Neil Armstrong may have been the first man to set foot on the moon, but he laid out your quilt so he and Buzz Aldrin could have a picnic.The idea of two astronauts having a picnic on the moon resulted in spontaneous laughter for both mother and son.Is Buzz Lightyear named after Buzz Aldrin? he asked his mom, as both continued to laugh.As a matter of fact he was, Elise replied with a smile. If you must know, Buzz Aldrin presented your quilt to Buzz Lightyear as a gift which means your blanket has beenTo infinity and beyond!Exactly, Elise confirmed as she refreshed his cloth and placed it back on his head.Day after day she would take her boy to doctors and then specialists and eventually to the hospital. Then, night after night, she would sit by his bed and tell the story of the quilt. Elise did everything she could to stretch out the story, and as each new adventure was passed from mother to son so too was hope, in the only way she knew how.The night that she finished the story was, in so many ways, just like most of the other nights. Elise was home in her favorite chair next to her sons bed. Her breathing was labored and her voice unsteady. And then I stopped by a flea market on my way home from the store and there it was, your beautiful, wonderful blanket. I knew you must have it, so I scooped it up, paid the nice woman, and brought it home to you.Tears filled Elises eyes as she sewed the last stitch on the old quilt. Holding it up, she remembered the first time her son covered himself with the blanket. Its finally fixed. Its perfect.Elise said out loud, tears continuing to flow. I love how cool it feels, too.Summoning every bit of her strength, she lay the beloved blanket on the empty bed in front of her.Being a mom is a job that is never truly finished, at least she had hoped so. With nothing else left to do for her son, she sat back in the chair and silently sobbed."
Night Vision: Remembering the Future,"Ive been to such a place so unimaginable, that even after sharing my experience, you would not be able to fathom what I have seen, felt, or witnessed. Butthis is my attempt to share with you what is beyond. Beyond comprehension. Beyond what weve been conditioned to believe to be real or fake.It was a Wednesday late afternoon, November 18th to be exact. I finally arrived home after a long day at work. My feet are throbbing, Im starved, and ready to crash. Eat or sleep first? Those were the options that faced my evening. I could barely think of anything but my bed. Welp! That was that! I threw my heels off, quickly changed my clothes into a very large, oversized tee-shirt. I walked over to the left side of my bed, lifted the blanket up and over, climbed into bed, and covered myself. I let out a deep sigh that sounded like the anxious wait is over. I scooted towards the edge of the bed to have one leg out and my arm bent slightly over the edge. Before I realized it, I was out for the count!Just when I thought I would have a peaceful rest, suddenly, I was being pulled up and out of my bed. Did you catch that? I was being pulled up and out of my bed. I was confused, frightened and amazed. I couldnt choose which emotion to settle in. I looked down to see how far up I am, but to my surprise, I saw my body lying there! I kept blinking and shaking my head to try and snap out of it, but nothing worked. I finally looked up to see what or who was pulling me upward, and it was a bright-lighted being. I began to wiggle and yell for help. This bright entity, this person whom I could only guess was an angelic being, looked down at me and descended to my eye level, placed its hand on my head, then on my right shoulder. The light-being then says, Peace. Thats all. Just peace. But that was all it took for me to truly be calm and comfortable with this new experience. We continued upward, out of my house. Then over the city. Eventually, we were above the country, then the face of the earth! We traveled past the clouds towards the darkness of space! I looked up at this angel and asked, Please, where are you taking me? The light being's response was, Do you not know? I was confused by this, like come on! This is my first rodeo.I remained silent because I was in awe of what I saw next. We were headed to only what I could describe as a translucent, wavy-like substance that reflected all kinds of colors. Colors I couldnt describe even if I tried. We got closer and I couldnt believe what it was! Isis that water? I asked. Before I knew it, we were traveling through water in space! But this wasnt ordinary water. I didnt drown. My lungs didnt fill with water. Im not sure if that is because my actual body is back at home in my bed or not. I just know that what I am experiencing is unimaginable. Oh, how to describe how this body of water felt. It was like touching life. I could feel this water protecting me in some way. It was as if I was submerged in 100% certainty and knowing what that felt like, truly. No, I got itit felt like I went through absolute truth. Through the water, I looked up and I could see many colors of light becoming deeper in contrast as we were about to come out. As we emerged from the watery-like portal, I was coated with the water. I then looked down to see what I was standing on. I can only describe it as a dragon-glass-like surface. I was full of amazement. What is this? I asked, looking at the water coating my body. The angel finally released me and answered, You are not yet in a form that can stand here. The water covering you are meant to protect. Wait?! Where is here? I had nearly forgotten this isnt Kansas anymore.The light-being motioned me to follow. As I followed along, I looked around me and I saw many beautiful colors glowing and flowing all around. I continued to explore with my eyes and saw more light-beings bringing other people like me through the water portal. I thought to myself, this must be like how we take a train and arrive at the station where people are waiting to board or depart to go to their next destination. I was shocked and honestly relieved. I was about to yell out to a person I saw in the distance but my guide, the light-being, stopped me and said, This journey is for you. Come. I nodded in agreement and walked alongside. We approached a watery barrier that towered so far past the eye view! It was massive! Much like the water portal we just passed through. Do you know where you are? Do you know why you are here? the guide asked. I, without shame, replied, No. I do not know where I am or why I am here. Am I dead? Is this heaven? He replied, No Olivia. You have not passed on. This is not heaven. I looked around again and at the water barrier, Is this a special realm? Is there such a thing as realms? I asked. Yes. You are about to enter the vision realm. He removed his gaze from me to look toward the water barrier. This is where you will see many wonders. You will see the present or you may see the future whether it is pleasant or destruction and death. You see what they choose for you to see, the guide explained. Wait! Who are ? The guide doesnt answer, he instead extends his hand and points toward the water barrier. I could only assume that means go through. I took a deep breath, I stuck my hand in first, then quickly retracted it. I took a step back and began shaking in fear. The guide touched my back and said, Peace. I took another deep breath, relaxed my shoulders, lifted my head, and proceeded through.I can't believe what I am seeing. Its like a war-stricken city. Its horrible! Buildings are in ruins and smoke arises from them. People running and screaming in fear and agony. I can no longer see myself, it's like Im viewing this through a lens. I feel like a fly on the wall. I continue to look on and see a modern-looking warrior running and taking cover multiple times as if they were on a mission. I see others like her following her lead. Shes decked with dirt-soiled clothes, combat boots, black gloves, an automatic weapon roped around her chest, a quiver with many arrows on her back, and the bow and arrow in her hands. Her hair is pulled back, her face covered in dirt and blood smudges. She looks focused and afraid at the same time. Waitis that me? Thats me! I exclaimed. I continued to look. I, the warrior, carefully cross a parking lot with burning cars, trash, and debris to the entry of a partially bombed building. This warrior, well me stops at the entryway, grabs the automatic weapon to look through the sniper scope to look out for nearby threats. She then motions the rest to hurry and cross through the parking lot and meet her. She opens the door, and everyone is pouring through. As the last one runs through the door, she looks out once more and closes the door behind her. They descend to the lowest floor of the building where it seems like survivors are holding up. There are children, men, and women all in their assigned areas. Everyone seems to have a role to play to survive. You can see some sorting rations, others building and repairing weapons. Even children are being taught to play their part in the survival efforts. I can only feel an atmosphere filled with nothing but sorrow. Some seem just too tired to carry on like this. Some are duty-focused. No matter the countenance of the people, none had joy or happiness. Only fear and a strong determination to survive the day. Ive never felt such sadness. I enter a room where other group leaders are gathered to debrief. Theres a table with an atlas laid out and a whiteboard with assignments lines and graphs drawn on it. I walk over to my place in the room, and someone yells out, Thank God, you made it! Others clap their hands and warmly welcome me back. I nodded in gratitude and called the meeting to order. We just heard word in the East sector that the military figured us out. We mustSuddenly the dream was fading, and I could no longer hear what was being said! It was like I was being pulled out of the dream. I kept saying, Wait! Wait! Theres more! Bring me back! Wait! Next thing I know the right side of my body was hurting. I looked down and around, and realized I was back in my room and fell off the bed! I began patting the floor, the wall, and my bed, then finally my face to see if I was truly back. Well, back in my body that is. I was indeed back. And before I knew it, I was fully overtaken with emotions. I began to cry and even chuckled a little bit. I asked myself, Did I really just leave this earth and enter a whole new dimension? Did I really witness wonder and devastation all in the same experience? I couldn't go back to sleep. I had to tell everyone and warn them! I told my family and friends. I wrote to TV and radio stations of that night, November 18th, the night I slept and traveled beyond. But literally, everyone thinks Im touched in the head! They all think Im crazy. But Im not crazy, you see. I know things that the average person cant handle, that's all. I took a deep breath after ranting on and looked around at white padded walls, the plainly covered bed, and the psychiatrist looking down at his pad, writing down his observations. I quickly remembered nothing I'm saying will ever matter. Im trapped in the one place I will never be heard. The psychiatrist, Dr. Zamdine says, So, Olivia, youve been here for 2 years now. We had hoped your delusions of grandeur would gradually fade away. But it seems you are still a danger to yourself and others. I looked toward the black tempered soundproof glass as if I knew there were others behind it observing me. I yelled, You know Im right! Thats why I'm here, isnt it! But I won't be for long. Youll see! Dr. Zamdine, held a slight smirk saying sternly, Until you recoveryou WILL remain, righthere. He rose from his chair and took it with him as he exited the room. I angrily stared him down as he left. I laid back down, faced the wall, clenched my fist in anger. I then began to cry silently from frustration and confusion. I couldnt fathom why I would be shown such wonder and of an apocalypse to come only to suffer this fate. While I lay in sorrow, suddenly I felt a warm hand on my right shoulder. I immediately stopped crying because I recognized that feeling. It was my guide! I then heard, Peace unto you Dreamer of dreams. Peace. I smiled, relaxed and closed my eyes to sleep. When I woke, I was laying down in my bed, in the same oversized tee-shirt I put on before I laid down to sleep. I popped up from my bed, sweating and breathing heavily. I immediately got out of bed and tripped all over the place as I frantically ran into the other rooms of my house. I got to my kitchen and opened the window to smell and feel the cool crisp air outside on my skin. I needed to know I was truly back home! I ran back to my room, stood at the doorway of my bedroom, and fell on my knees with my eyes full of tears. Many thoughts raced through my head. So many emotions pulsating through the center of my being. I realized this wasnt just a dream from bad Thai food I had for lunch. No. I was chosen to see what the end will be.Most cannot handle what I have just told you. But I think you know exactly what I am talking about. Dont you? Do you recall when I told you I saw others with their guides emerging from the water portal? Well, I think you are one of them! I have spent 5 years trying to track down others like melike us. Those who have been where we have been and may be seen what weve seen. I strongly believe that we all have seen the same future apocalypse in pieces. Like a puzzle, we are to come together to complete the picture! I know Im right about you! I can see it in your eyes. I havent told a living soul til now because the dream warned of what would happen if I just went around telling everyone the fate of the world. Right now, only a Dreamer of Dreams can hear what we have seen. I've come all this way and have risked everything by sharing what Ive seen with you. Will you join me in finding the others and begin preparing for what is to come? Or will you take the easy way out and pretend it was just a dream? The choiceis yours."
The Locked Door,"There once was a curious little boy who was an absolute delight to be in the company of. Eyes so bright they outshine the sky and a smile so wide and contagious itd make grumpy Uncle Bob crack a grin. Young in age and young in spirit, he sought out adventure as any other kid would. He was always determined to uncover mysteries of this beautiful house he called home. In this peaceful home lived an elegant mum of a giddy little boy and his name was Thomas.His toes spread out across the cold wooden floor as he stretched as tall as his little body would let him. The glowing evening sun slowly seeped onto his eager fingers that were reaching for the door knob only a few inches out of his reach. Though his young back began to ache, he gave no sign of giving in. Licking his lips at the thought of the mountain of homemade chocolate chip cookies he was desperately hoping were piled up behind the door. He adjusted his current position, switching arms as if his right were longer than the other, this was turning out to be quite the challenge. Shifting his weight from left to right, his feather footing was as quiet as a mouse, this was not his first attempt. His heart raced a thousand miles as he knew the time was ticking, mum would catch him at any moment.He first saw the cupboard a few weeks prior, when mum was making supper one evening. Shed sung soulful jazz over the record as she danced in her baby pink and blue apron, sliding gracefully around the kitchen. Thomas loved evening time with mumma, she was just so pretty and sounded like a sweet bird in the morning. He was so giggly and magnetized by his mum that he almost didnt notice the secret door within the pantry she'd just swooped out of. Leaving the door open, just enough for two blue curious eyes to peer into, he locked his sight on a mystery he so desperately needed to uncover. Without a second thought, he climbed down from the chair and raced so fast he thudded across the floor smacking head on into the main door of the pantry. Drenched in a hard ache, he cried and screamed until mummy picked him up and held him in her arms for at least a few minutes. That one really hurt.Thomas had been thinking about the secret cupboard ever since hed discovered it. Although a bit sore, he was not disheartened by his first attempt in unlocking the secret contents behind the locked door. It was more than just curiosity in his child mind that kept his fire burning, the excitement and thrill of sneaking around to make an exceptional discovery was far more motivating. This discovery would be the first of many he endured to uncover. We all have to start somewhere.It was the first thing on his mind as he arrived at day-care and when the other kids wanted to play; Come on Thomas!, Come play on the swings! he retreated into his little nook in the tree, scheming. How does a four a year old become capable of accessing a secret door that's much, much greater than he is? What would it take to achieve this task that had been set in stone, engraved on his little mind after first laying his eyes on the mystery cupboard? He decided he needed time on his side, hed wait till it was time for his bath, the only time when mum would be upstairs, and hed have a few moments alone to complete the mission. That afternoon, as he was pulling his body upwards as best as he possibly could, he began to feel a bit hopeless, he just wasnt tall enough. Jumping and stretching, changing hands and feet just wasnt making him any closer to the brass knob above. Then it came to him, in his determined little mind, he realised that although he couldnt make himself taller, something else would! Exploding with excitement and with a mischievous grin at his genius plan, he raced over to the other side of the kitchen and slowly dragged a screeching kitchen chair over to the pantry. One small, but committed step at a time he crawled up on the chair where he triumphantly stood up. Hed almost done it! He was so close! His hand reached the dusty knob which ruled over the rest of the shelves in this kingdom of goods and non-perishables. Pulling with all his might and two hands, like his entire childhood depended on it, he squealed excitedly, but the unexpected happened, the door was locked! Before he knew it, one last aggressive tug at the knob had sent him flying backwards off all limbs. His heart had left his chest and stayed up in the clouds as his body plummeted before the fast approaching ground below. As the cold smack of the timber waited for poor Thomas, a warm embrace scooped him up and spun him around before he knew what had happened. His mum had been there in the nick of time to save him from a nasty fall.After a big fright, a long bath and some stern words from mummy, Thomas was exasperated from the day's events and was longing for his bed. He really believed he could do it, he could unlock the mystery that burned through his bones each day, a door longing to be opened. What on earth could be in that cupboard? After two attempts now, he pondered how to tackle it again for the third and final time.As Thomas was sunk into the chair in disappointment after some warm milk, he just noticed mum creeping into the kitchen with a key in hand and disappeared into the war zone hed only just survived a few hours earlier. She came out with a smile sewed onto her face and gleaming eyes; Only just this once, Tommy. And she served him an old china tea cup, on which was placed a homemade chocolate chip biscuit, baked by his favourite person in the world. His golden treat! - kept all this time, behind the locked door."
From bubbles to burst and boost!,"Buoyed by the principles plus precepts learnt from watching a few YouTube videos on skiing well and without fear as a novice, I set off down the snowy slope with a significant sense of dj vu! This euphoric feeling was as indescribable as it was enjoyable. This wind at my back turned to temporal dysphoria as I crashed into someone while seeking to employ a wedge stop technique practiced a few times after watching the how-tos. A more experienced skier auspiciously came to the rescue of my ""victim"" as I steadily moved to a safe spot. Basking in the euphoria of fully skiing for the very first time made me forgetful about avoiding an accident... The person I crashed into and the rescuer continued down the hill after slowing down to confirm I was okay. I muttered a rapid prayer of Thanksgiving to God for safety. With this done, I was back in high spirits ready to continue with increased care and competence. I sure wasn't ready to give up! The more daunting the task, the more daring I can be. This disposition describes me since attempting to date a dancer I met while on duty in a departmental store where I briefly worked. Her velvety voice saying ""Excuse me sir, do you work here by any chance?"" as she sought out a particular product principally ""pulled"" me to her as I thought ""this lady must be 'mine' if she's not already hooked up with anyone!"" Her svelte silhouette surely sealed my stance as I blurted out ""are you married or in any serious relationship with any man?"" Flabbergasted and flushed, she fumbled for words to say without being overly brutish or brutalizing my ego... ... flustered but not feeling foolish, I found the courage to correct course by saying ""Yes, I work here but I'm very honoured to have been blessed with the chance of meeting you. Would you please forgive my being rash even though I'm truly interested in  knowing you?"" The fury on her face faded into a smile that made me further think ""this woman and I sure need to become close friends"". She then responded by saying ""it's okay as I see that you are not the highly insensitive and incongruous individual I initially thought you were...; but I must say you're intrepid!"" ""intre..what?"" I replied. ""You're interestingly fearless and forthrightly bold"", shesaidas we both burst out laughing. Then I introduced myself and she reciprocated. She was in search of silver coloured swimsuits she could adapt as costume for the next dance presentation of her troupe. On showing her the pertinent section of the store, I proposed two complementary colours - light purple and light blue - to her. She accepted my propositions and profusely thanked me as I escorted her to the till area. As she joined the queue, I excused myself muttering ""I'll be back in a jiffy."" I dashed to pick up my stuff as my shift for the day was now over. But my section manager requested help to reset his computer and thus an unexpected quarter of an hour! On returning to the till, she was nowhere in sight but the cashier handed me a note tucked inside an envelope from her. Excited and curious but unwilling to show my disappointment mixed with anticipation, I calmly put the envelope in my knapsack and headed home, a few blocks away. On getting into my studio apartment, I quickly opened the envelope hoping to therein find her phone number and request to be called, but alas, it was not so. The little note in one of the loveliest handwriting ever sighted simply read: ""Good things come to those who wait for and merit them. Sorry I could no longer wait as I have a plane to catch and billed to be back in six weeks after a tour with my team. I hope to answer your two-in-one question on my return if the wait turns out to be worthwhile for us both. Meeting you was a memorable encounter. Thank you once again and take care.- Your 'yet-to-be' friend."" ""Six weeks!? I'm scheduled to also leave town in two weeks as my sojourn at the departmental store comes to an end in a week!"" I thought to myself. That was six months ago. Now in Switzerland for a sixteen-week writing project, I came in three days ago, a week before the expected commencement of this plum job. This is in order to take advantage of a stay offered to me in a resort owned by the parents of a Swiss friend I met three years ago at a writing conference. It also affords me the opportunity to enjoy a dream activity - skiing. The following morning, on the way to a breakfast of rsti, raclette and lamb in one of the restaurants, the chit-chat of a motley crew could be heard behind me... Suddenly, a particular voice stopped me in my tracks as my heart skipped a beat and I trembled with unbelief. ""Was I finally going to see her again? Is that not the velvety voice I've been longing to hear for the past half-year?"" Turning back, her instant recognition of me was a welcome validation. ""Oh my goodness, we finally meet again!"", she said, as she rushed towards me and beaming, I instinctively threw my hands wide open for her to crash into. We struggled to outdo each other in playing catch up. It seemed so serene and sensible to be together. With breakfast and others around us immediately put on hold, hand in hand, we gravitated towards a nearby face to face bench and settled in. She looked so beautiful I wished I could watch her all day that day and every other day! All anxieties about what to say if we ever met again had disappeared into thin air. She regaled me with stories of how, on her return from the tour, she hadgone back to the departmental store many times every week for six weeks to look for me (or get information that could reconnect her with me) before giving up. For an inexplicable reason, I had brought her note with me on this trip. More curious was the fact that I read it just before leaving my room and ended up putting it in my shirt pocket. Reaching therefore into my pocket, I brought it out and I could see her liven up even more as she gasped in surprise. ""Oh l l, you still have the note with you. When I couldn't find you, I wished I had left my contact details in it"", she said. On flipping open the note and putting it sideways for it to be readable, we chorused the first sentence: ""Good things come to those who wait for and merit them."""
A reticent but resolute carer at work.,"Reticent but resolute, he waltzed into the kitchen to make her the tea recently requested. The hum of the freezer fused into a samba with the sound of the kettle at work. Immediately, his mind wandered to what the weekend ahead would be like if the expected helper does not show up. The last few weeks of having to take care of her more than ever before have been really stressful.They were however made more bearable by her brother as well as his deep love for them both. But now that her beloved brotheris billed to return to his base later today, an appropriate assistant will be absolutely appreciated.He also remembered he would need to intimate her of the important call she has to expect.Just then, the popping sound signifying the water coming to boiling point snaps him out of his reverie. With a deftness that has become second nature by reason of the last two decades, he promptly made the tea while not forgetting to add her favourite flavouring! He quickly took it to her, piping hot, as she likes it.  He watched satisfyingly as she took the tea, sweating profusely but becoming less pale with every sip. He also looked forward to hearing her habitual Thank you; that was really nice!Additionally, seeing the contentment mixed with gratitude on her faceis usually priceless. Thankfully, the worst is likely over according to the last check of the doctors.But what exactly is the situation? What would the expected result to the last series of tests be? Its time to tell her about the call, he resolved. As he was about to broach the subject, her telephone started to ring. Startled, she looked at him with a questioning frown. He immediately understood her thought: When did you switch on my phone? I thought we agreed to leave it off until early next week when we put it off a week ago! Sweetheart, it is true it was to stay off for at least ten days so you could have sufficient time to rest, relax and recuperate... But the youngest of your doctors called me yesterday night to complain that he had been trying to reach you without successhence I switched it on this morning just before you woke up. I was actually just about to tell you"", he lovingly said. Appreciatinghim, she downed the remainder of the tea and reached for the phone.He briskly picked up the mug and sauntered back into the kitchen.Though anxious to know what was so important that the doctor insisted on personally telling her, he proceeded to making a special breakfast for her, her brother and himself. Spanish eggs with spinach and prawns have never failed to cheer everyone up. This delicacy became a family favourite on an holiday trip to Spain seven years ago. On that trip, a brown-eyed boy did not drown because of her brothers heroic act. What more? It was on that trip he invented a game in which one player swims to reach a throne in order to receive a golden brown crown while dodging drone attacks of the other player and simultaneously ensuring that the baby being held does not drown. Fortunately, he made a substantial amount and still gets some residual income from the idea. The game company that purchased it still produces and profitably sells. Meanwhile, she exchanged pleasantries with the doctor and apologized for having been unreachable beforeexplainingwhy. He sheepishly told her there were two very important reasons for his call.With a curious and somewhat worrisome look, she gingerly started walking out of the room in search of her loving and committed carer. She definitely did not want to hear whatever this dainty doctor had to say alone. Eager to reach the kitchen before allowing the conversation to continue, she asked him to kindly hold on for a few minutes... On reaching the threshold of the kitchen, the appetizing aroma of the Spanish eggs with spinach and prawns made her give a thumbs up to her current chief chef before motioningto him to please keep quiet and listen in on the conversation with her... Swiftly putting the phone on speaker mode, she thanked the doctor for holding on and asked him to continue the discussion.The doctor then announced that the first reason for calling was professional while the other was personal. On the professional level, he informed her that the last test carried out on her was a false positive so she could relax more and expect to fully recover within a week. With tears of joy streaming down her face, she collapsed into a chair by the dining table and the telephone fell from her hand. Highly alert and attentive, her chief carer used his shoes to cushion the fall of the smartphone, picked it up, told the doctor to please call back in five minutes,then cuddledher in his arms, rejoicing with and thanking God for her. My little girl,now a lovely lady,has been spared the agony of having a terminal disease!, hethought to himself. The loss of her mother - his wife- twenty years ago when she was just a little over two years old and her brother was five, seemed like yesterday. He recalled resolving to take care of themas resilientlyas possible even if he would have to constantly battle reticence! Like clockwork, the doctor called back in five minutes. By this time, she had regained her composure.Picking up with gusto,she responded yes, my dear doctor, thanks for the good news you just gave me! Stuttering, he asked if she was okay and sought to know what really happenedwhen he heard a thud before her father abruptly requestedhe call back. Smiling, she told him it was essentially a momentary but momentous assimilation of what was said. Still stammering, he wondered aloud if he couldprogressto the personal discourse. At this juncture, her father discreetly disappeared so as to let them freely talk... With a teasing tone, she told him she was now all alone before enquiringif he was shy.He solemnly replied,I'm shybutnot sly."
Snowed-in by Choice,"Snow danced in the wind outside the frosted windows of her small chalet. This was a cold wind, sharp as a slap and just as shocking against bare skin. It caught the small snowflakes and swirled them into heavy drifts against her chalets walls.  She watched the snow dance and swirl from snug inside her chalet, tucked close to a crackling fire. This was a real fire, wooden logs piled high on the hearth to keep it fed and roaring. From her spot a supremely good spot she had a view out the window, along with the rest of the small room and down the hall. Her chalet was always the first to snowed in when a storm approached. Something about the placement of the building and the wind patterns. The subject bored her so she wandered away or fell asleep when someone tried to explain.  She watched the wind rattle the trees around her chalet and fling free snow that had managed to cling to the branches. A few people they must be guests of a nearby chalet hurried back to their lodgings. They were foolish wandering out when a winter storm was so close. Their lack of caution could tempt the storm into flexing her muscles to remind them all her potential for destruction. She thought them all fools. The guests, that is, who came to the mountain and to her chalet, to engage in their winter sports. She did not understand how anyone enjoyed hurtling down a mountain on thin pieces of wood. Especially in the biting cold.  But enjoy they did. And complain they did also, especially when the slopes closed ahead of the winter storm. The complainers didnt seem to care that the slopes closed for their own safety. They had come to hurtle down the mountain and any alternative was subpar. She yawned and stretched, shifting to toast a slightly different part of herself in the fire. She had ensconced herself in what was the chalets reading room. It was not as popular as the larger media room nearby. There the large screen T.V. reigned supreme as it belched forth entertainment for the masses. No, the reading room was quieter and cozier and suited her perfectly. She turned from the window to survey the few guests nearby, sharing in the quiet room and warmth of the fireplace. They were a young couple with two children, one a baby asleep against its fathers shoulder. The couple talked in soft voices while an older child in a painfully bright sweater played on the floor. The family was part of a larger group, who she had seen streaming towards the T.V.s amusements. But only after they made known their complaints about the weather in loud voices. She didnt understand the complaining. A storm was not unexpected this time of year. Encountering one was a risk that went hand-in-hand with these beloved winter sports. Plus, what were the employees, who bore the brunt of the complaints, supposed to do about an act of nature? Clearly there was nothing they could do. But if there was one thing she had learned in her chalet, it was that there were always guests who liked to complain. She noticed then that she had caught the attention of the couple's older child. The child stared at her with large, solemn eyes. She stared back for a time, before redirecting her gaze back to the fire. She didnt mind children, but she also didnt encourage them.  The wind gained strength and threw itself against the windows, howling in rage at the obstacle.The trees rocked and shook in the winds fury as it directed its frustrations instead against their trunks. These trees had stood in their place for decades upon decades. They had withstood without yielding ground storms stronger than this one would become.  The howling wind reminded her of the year before when she had briefly been stuck outside. A storm had arisen faster than she had expected and caught her unawares. In her rush back to her chalet, she fell into a snowdrift. There she would have frozen and died mere feet from safety. But rescue came almost immediately. She shivered now at the memory of that cold and how long she had to sit in front of the fire before she felt warm again. She was too old now for such adventures. She had remained close to the chalet since then when she did choose to venture out. Which was rare, especially if a storm approached. No reason to tempt fate. She turned her head at a soft noise nearby. The child had approached her, still staring, and now with a finger in their mouth. They had stopped a few feet away to stare from a closer distance, cautious. She returned the childs stare and waited to see what the child would do. She had no idea how old the child was, except that it was older than the baby sibling nearby. Though herds of children moved in and out of her chalet, she never gained more knowledge about them. Except that she had learned which children to avoid. She was quick to vacate a room when one of those monsters approached.  But this child was quieter and calmer than the monster children. They crept closer until they leaned against the arm of her chair. Their wide eyes barely seemed to blink as they returned her stare. The finger stayed firmly planted in their mouth. The wind gave a sharp howl and a harsh slap to the nearby window. The sudden noise startled the child, who pulled back a few inches from the chair. The childs stare broke from hers as they turned back to look at their parents for reassurance. But the parents, engrossed in their quiet conversation, did not notice their child.  She reached out and gently patted the childs hand, the one not in the child's mouth.She wanted to reassure the child, but also she wanted the childs attention again. She could tell now that this child was not one of the grabby monsters. Surprised the child turned back to her and their lips parted from their finger in a shy smile. They reached carefully towards her with their free hand, fingers outstretched. She stretched forward to meet those fingers and the child stroked the soft fur between her ears.  Be careful, Addison, one of the parents called. Be gentle with the kitty. The childs fingers stayed gentle between her ears so she let out a loud rumbling purr in reward.A soft giggle escaped from the child, sneaking its way free from around the finger. She closed her eyes. Her purr rumbled deep in her chest and the child continued to pet her between her ears and along her fire toasted side. Darkness fell outside the window as the snow fell and the wind raged. But inside her chalet all was as she liked it. Because in her experience, being snowed in was much better than being snowed out."
Elliot and Ginger,"By Audrey GaraySitting on the bench with his face buried in his elbow on the hard wooden table, Elliot wondered, Are you there God? Its me Elliot, the skinny little kid with freckles all over my nose.Elliot! Hows that English coming? his mother Marcie, called across the room from behind the coffee counter. Im working on it Mom, Elliot yelled back.It looks like youre working on sleeping.Elliot tried to swipe the tears from his cheeks while still keeping his head tucked. It would never do for everyone in the whole diner to see him crying. Im almost finished Mom, can I take it to the park across the street to finish?His mother sighed, Go ahead, but you better get it done. I wont be able to help you tonight. Itll be too late by the time Im able to close the diner.Grabbing his computer Elliot ran out the door, the bell clanging behind him. He was so relieved to be out in the fresh air, that didnt smell like coffee, he forgot to check the traffic. An oncoming vehicle dodged, barely missing him as he ran.Only after he flopped at the nearest picnic table in a breathless huff did he notice the lady sitting on the other side of the table. She had her back turned to the street and didnt seem to notice Elliot. Oh, sorry, he started to apologize for shaking the bench but stopped when he heard her sniffle. Elliot slid quietly to the middle of the table,  Scuse me maam, are you okay? As she turned toward him, she swiped her face with the scarf flopped loosely around her neck, Im sorry, I didnt notice you there. I was just talking to God.Did he talk back to you? I was trying to talk to him a few minutes ago, said Elliot.Of course, he did, she said. Swiping her hands down her scarf she stuck out her right hand, Im Ginger. Im Elliot, he answered as he took her hand in his. Elliot rubbed the back of her hand with his soft little thumb, Your hands are so ruff.Sorry about that, she said as she withdrew her hand, I dont have a job right now and cant afford a lot of lotion.Elliot wrinkled his freckled nose, Is that what you were talking to God about?Kinda, I was sharing the few crumbs I had left from breakfast with the little, twittering birds, she said.Did he talk back to you?He sure did, she assured him.Elliots eyes grew wide, How do you know? What did he say?Well Elliot, God reminded me that if he takes care of the little birds that flutter around, and the only work they have to do is sing, then he will surely take care of me too. What were you asking God for?Umm, school is really hard. My mom works over there at the diner all the time, he said nodding his head in the direction of the little restaurant across the street. She doesnt have time to help me.Ginger looked at Elliot with compassion in her eyes, What about your dad? Hes a soldier and not home right now, Elliot said as tears filled his eyes.Maybe I can help you, Ginger offered.A smile spread across Elliots face, Really? Thats cool!Sure, she said, Bring your computer over here and lets see what we can do.Elliot slid close to Ginger and huffed, How am I supposed to know what a noun is?Ginger smiled, A noun is the word used for a person, place or thing that the sentence is talking about. In your sentence, Is there a person?Elliot shook his head, Nope.Okay, but what is the sentence talking about?Its talking about a horse, Elliot said.Exactly. That is the noun of your sentence. Ginger raised her hand and gave Elliot a high five. And a verb describes what the horse is doing. So whats he doing?Hes running, Elliot answered.Youre a lot smarter than you thought, she said.After a few more questions Elliot looked up, his little freckled face beaming, That was the last one.I knew you could do it, Ginger said as her stomach growled really loud.Your tummy sounds like mine before lunch time, Elliot said, Come on, lets go over to the restaurant and get something to eat.No dear, Im fine. But you run on over and put your computer up and get your dinner.Please. I really want you to meet my mom. Shell be so happy you helped me with my homework, Elliot begged.Well, lets go, Ginger agreed.As they walked into the restaurant Elliots mom came from the kitchen, one hand balancing a platter loaded with two plates and the other carrying a pitcher of water. Ginger reached out, Here let me help you with that, she said, as she took the water pitcher, allowing Elliots mom to grab the platter with both hands.Thanks, she said glancing up with a puzzled look.Mom, this is my new friend Ginger, she helped me with my homework.Thank you again, stammered Elliots mom. Please call me Marcie.Marcie, it was my pleasure, said GingerMom, were hungry. Can we have burgers?Oh no Elliot, I have to be going, Ginger said, her stomach growling loudly again.Nonsense, Ginger sit down. I will bring burgers right out. Its the least I can do after you helped Elliot with his homework and me with the water. Do you like cheese on your burger?I want cheese, Elliot chimed in bouncing up and down on the seat.Please. Elliot, you need to say, Id like cheese please. Marcie corrected. Yes maam. Elliot said, looking at his feet. Id like cheese, please.Looking back at Ginger, Now Ginger, how about you?Ginger brushed a loose curl of bright red hair from cheek, Id like cheese too please.After Marcie stepped back into the kitchen Ginger told Elliot, Im going to step into the ladies room and wash up.Guess I should too. Ill show you where the bathrooms are, Elliot said proudly leading the way.Elliot finished his meal and was licking the french fry salt from his fingers, Marcie came over, Thank you again Ginger for helping Elliot with his homework. My pleasure, Ginger said.Mom, Ginger said she needs a job so she can afford hand lotion.Ginger blushed and looked down at the table, Elliot, its fine dear.Noticing Gingers discomfort, Marcie smiled, Ginger, I could really use some help here during the lunch rush if youre not busy. Then when Elliot gets in from school if you had time to help him a little with homework, I would be so thankful.Ginger blinked trying to clear the tears that filled her eyes. She reached up to tame that unruly curl again, It would be an honor to help this smart young man with his homework, she finally managed to whisper.Then its settled. You come in at ten thirty tomorrow morning and help here during the lunch hour. When Elliot gets in from school at three thirty you can help him with his homework. His grades are suffering, and Ive felt like a drowning victim with his father away. Ive just been praying, asking God if he could hear me,"" said Marcie.Ginger patted her arm, It sounds like Gods been doing a lot of listening today."
The Card-iologist,"""Hiiiii. Welcome to Hallmark Greetings & Gifts. May I help you find something today?""""Well, uh, yes. I'm looking for a Valentine's Day card. For my niece.""""Perfect. Our Valentine's day selection is over here.Are you sure?Am I what?Are you sure? I mean, these cards are assorted blues and yellows and greens.And?I was looking for cards. I was expecting a selection of cards in reds and pinks. Maybe some glitter.Sir, we are an card store.

You know, like my brothers daughter.Niece? Brother? Daughter? Im not sure what you mean. We have a very nice selection of cards. They can be found in any of the three aforementioned colors.Listen, young man. If I didnt care enough to send the very best, I would walk out right now.? What are you? Some kind of ? It is completely inappropriate to force your traditional identifiers on us. Do I need to call my personager?No, wait. Im so sorry. I assumed you were a man. I mean, your septum rings engraving reads .Sir, youll note my personal self-expression is intentionally ironic. I think both you and I completely understand its a human and world.Of course, of course. So, do you have any huwomans cards?Please, sir. If you dont stop with your offensive archaic patriarchal classifications, Im going to have to ask you to leave.Beg your pardon?Here at Hallmark, all of our cards are gender neutral and nonbinary.Wait, youre trying to tell me that you dont believe there are two sexes?There you go again.. What did I do this time?You used the word .Excuse me, genders.And there it is again.What?!SEX-es. EX-cuse. Tell me you didnt use words with xs in themjust to make fun of me.Why would I do that?Oh, so now youre using Y. Dont think I know you arent gaslighting me with your references to x and y chromosomes.Youve got to be kidding me. I need to avoid using the letters x and y? Thats the most ridiculous thing Ive ever heard.? You really said ? We do not recognise age here. We at Hallmark are also non-numeric when it comes to age. Have you been living on a deserted island? Are you Gilligan or Mary Ann?Actually, I prefer Ginger.You prefer characters named after seasonings?! You do realize that seasonings are objects, thus you must support the objectification of persons who are neither seasonings nor objects.Im not objectifying anyone!One? Any? Typical of someone who is not supportive of the community. Youve automatically assumed not only my gender, but also my number. I am not any. I am anytwo.

And we dont want to use the term .You are shitting me.I wouldnt shit you as you are quickly becoming my favorite turd.Thats not funny.I know, but using the word isnt funny either.Why the hell not? Because playing cards have kings and queens? And kings are always boys and queens are girls?Hey, youre right. I hadnt thought to be offended at that, yet there is more. Diamonds are a girl's best friend, but there are no more girls. A spade is a pejorative name for melanin over abundant persons.

Endy Mendy,"What if I told you there was a demon devoted to the broken hearted? What if I told you that this isn't some fairy tale with monsters and villains, but a very real, breathing creation that is as old as time itself? This creature's sole existence revolves around targeting the broken-hearted, and trying in his own twisted way to mend them. He only targets adults and leaves children well alone. He has no business cavorting with the realm of childish creations. This creature visits nearly all adults and leaves his mark on them. This creature's name, is Endy Mendy. Endy Mendy is a demon, let me tell you that much. He targets the broken-hearted and heals them in his own depraved way. Endy Mendy slips into your room late at night and waits for you to fall asleep. That fleeting shape you see out of the corner of your eye? It's probably just the shadow of a branch outside and nothing more. Endy Mendy is much more terrifying, because he's invisible. He stands beside your bed, tall and hunched, waiting patiently. You may feel a faint breath on your cheek as you fall asleep. He does get rather close in anticipation. Once you're asleep, Endy Mendy delves his talons deep into your chest and squeezes your heart with glee. Ever feel your heart rate fleetingly jump as you drift into sleep? It's him, and he's squeezing. Endy Mendy squeezes your heart until it shatters into a thousand pieces. Because you're asleep, you won't feel a thing. Sleep numbs your heart, it acts as a merciful anaesthetic. Once your heart has been shattered, Endy Mendy hunches over you and gets to work, salivating excitedly as he does so. You know that small wet patch on your pillow when you wake up? It's not your drool. Once your heart has been shattered, Endy Mendy remakes it carefully, working late through the night. He pieces the shards of your heart together like an intricate puzzle, spit-shining the memories that cause you pain, so you never forget about them, for he believes remembering pain will help you avoid it in the future. Once your heart is pieced together again, he identifies the piece that lets you love- the purest most shiny part of your heart. And he steals it. You wake up in the morning and may feel a little groggy- it's natural after having your entire heart shattered and remade. You'll notice yourself becoming bitter and jaded as the days roll on, your smile becoming a wispy memory, your favourite colours diluted to dull puddles of indifference. In Endy Mendy's eyes, he has healed you, for when you're bitter it's impossible for your heart to truly love someone, and no love means no further heartbreak. Endy Mendy leaves you with the most vital part of your heart missing, with a small hole left in its place. That hole, will steadily haemorrhage the very fuel your heart runs on- hope. So why steal the crucial shard of your heart that helps you love? Well, Endy Mendy keeps that shard of your heart and melts it down. He then uses the liquid as ink, to write letters to a certain someone. You see, Endy Mendy is broken hearted himself, having been spurned a long time ago by a woman who scorned his very existence. The poor creature does not know how to love, so tries to sway her by frantically writing in the heart-ink of others, and sending these as desperate gifts to her every night. The woman he yearns after, is named Shadow-Lust. Shadow-Lust was born of the evil things that men do in the dark. One day, that very darkness and the smirk of a lying politician melded together in union and discovered they understood each other in twisted and quaint ways. Before long, Shadow-Lust was born, and was promptly hurled into the night, where she scarpered from corner to corner, searching frantically for her parents and stumbling every other step, for she was born with dark coals for eyes. Endy Mendy bumped into Shadow-Lust and was enamoured with her instantly. But being a demon, he couldn't express this love, so she spurned him, leaving him distraught and angry. This is why Endy Mendy needs that piece of your heart, for he cannot understand love himself. A strong heart will repel him instantly, but someone who is broken-hearted is the perfect victim for the demon known as Endy Mendy. But back to you. Endy Mendy leaving a hole in your heart isn't the end, stranger. You see, the heart has an amazing ability after heartbreak. It can regenerate. However, you can only start the regenerating process once you accept that you are broken, and that Endy Mendy has meddled with your heart. It's upsetting to realise, but it's a necessary step before you can begin the healing process. The missing shard will be remade from the experience you harbour, meaning your heart can never be shattered in that exact way ever again. It may take months or even years, but your heart's natural instinct is to heal itself, but only if you let it get on with its job. A heart that is broken, that is vulnerable and in pain, is like a delectable feast for Endy Mendy. Sometimes, before he visits the broken-hearted by their bedside, he'll jump on their back and wrap his spindly arms around them, in a twisted sort of embrace. Ever notice when you're heart-broken you'll sometimes feel leaden-heavy and tired? You might want to shake around a bit, for Endy Mendy has probably hitched a ride. Before I leave, let me impart some knowledge that will save you from ever dealing with Endy Mendy and his talons. The one thing that Endy Mendy cannot be in the same room as, let alone touch, is a heart that loves itself. It emits a pulse so strong it makes his eyeballs rove in their sockets, and he scarpers into the darkness, never to be seen again, snarling and snapping over his shoulder. A heart that loves itself understands heartbreak is a natural part of life, and allows itself to feel pain and sadness, for they are the forgotten siblings of ecstasy and joy. So protect your heart, stranger. Beware of Endy Mendy and his twisted talons."
"Nutella, it's not for you","""This is the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. Taste it! I wish they had it in the Czech Republic,"" Stella sighed. Thomas took a swallow. 400,000 tons of Nutella. That's the amount of hazelnut cream consumed by humans to this day, with a lot of help from those who are no longer with us. That's approximately 24,242 Czech Tatra 815 trucks fully loaded with the thick sweet paste. If you lined them up in a row, you'd have to circle the globe four times to see them all. And Thomas thought he could literally see his girlfriend, Stella, consuming an entire truck. ""Sorry, I can't yet,"" Stella said a second after he heard the door to their apartment slam. Without giving him the slightest glance, she threw off her coat, pulled her battered laptop out of her bag, and ran to the kitchen table. He sighed in annoyance.""Tough day at work?""""Not really. I just need to finish one article, pick out some photos and then I'll get right back to you,"" she responded. She managed to overlook the flowers he'd bought her on her lunch break, the new shirt he'd gotten for the occasion to make him look better, and the fact that the apartment was all cleaned up. Soon there was the familiar sound of fingers drumming hard on the keyboard, flowing to the rhythm of a partly manic and partly completely unnecessary fear that if she didn't get the article in on time, the whole world would collapse. As Thomas saw it, the only thing showing signs of collapse at that moment was Stella.""I think I'll go to bed now,"" he said, hoping that Stella would understand from the tone of his announcement that the workday was over for him. He went to his bedroom, where, with a typical stubbornness that is not to be shown in today's world, he pulled off his shirt and pulled back on his favourite T-shirt that he slept in every night and in which he had secretly spent the whole day.""Good night,"" he said, still in the kitchen doorway, as he watched Stella shovel in another kilo of Nutella. That's only one kilo out of the 400 million she would have to eat to equal the whole of humanity, he thought with relief, and went to sleep. Valentine's Day was five days away.He was awakened by the sound of Stella's door slamming as she left for work. As usual, he didn't get up early enough for them to have a few words to exchange. With each such slam, he got out of bed as if someone had just raised the alarm on the street. Reeling from the shock he couldn't face, he staggered to the bathroom, brushed his teeth, pulled on his pants and went to work. ""Where are you taking that girl of yours tomorrow?"" echoed his co-worker jovially, to whom the holiday of love made perfect sense and who never dared to question the significance of the chocolates and half wilted flowers he fought over every year in crowded malls with a legion of other men. They all believed that it was the very least thing they could do for their halves, and the strength of the shared belief ultimately proved them right every February. Those who didn't buy into it had to face a few uncomfortable minutes of explaining to others that they didn't believe in Valentine's Day, or that it was a completely consumerist holiday that they refused to participate in. ""We're going to this new place that just opened around the corner. That's a holiday today, isn't it?"" a colleague gushed. Thomas felt like punching him right there and then. Instead, he turned his face towards another colleague, who was bored watching a review of the new games that would soon be released on the Playstation. In the evening, a familiar scene awaited him at home. Stella, still in her work clothes and with her mascara slightly smudged, reinforcing the dark shadow under her eyes, sat at the kitchen table tapping out more words on her computer. He had come home later than usual, arousing her curiosity.""Where are you coming from?""""From work.""""This late?"" She grumbled.""I figured you'd probably still be working, so I did some extra work,"" he explained to her. Stella mumbled something vaguely, then said:""I need to rest.""""Really?"" He asked. ""Come on, I'll read you something from the book I'm reading,"" Thomas offered her.""Oh no, no reading at all. After all, I consume and create content from morning to night,"" Stella said, continuing to write as if no dialogue had taken place. A second later, she got up and ran to the pantry for more Nutella. And that's when it clicked for him.This time they would celebrate the holiday of love together like never.  The sun was beating down on them so hard that they could hardly keep their bodies upright. Thomas was getting tired and would have liked to stick his head in the sand if only it wasn't so hot. Stella, however, seemed to be content. There was no sign on her dark skin that the hot sun's rays could harm her in any way. She laid with her eyelids closed on the blanket, which was covered with grains of sand, while Thomas repeatedly slathered his white arms with sunscreen and gazed longingly at the surface of the water until it finally turned pink. He didn't enjoy it much. But he was glad that Stella was finally resting. She loved the sea, and after years of denial, for which she could blame the randomness of fate, which had not bestowed wealth on either of them, he could finally take her to the shores of Italy. Stella could lie on the beach all day and boredom did not come upon her. He envied her for it and looked forward himself to the day giving way to night, and them finally replacing the natural solarium with a nice warm breeze and stone sidewalks to keep them pleasantly cool while they sipped wine in one of the overpriced restaurants.

""Mhmm,"" the voice beside him echoed just as he thought his body temperature must soon be climbing to a life-threatening high. Stella stretched her arms behind her head and purred like a cat that had just decided to wake up from a sleep that was none of people's business. She felt her eyelids flutter open in a complicated way; the red darkness replaced by a harsh light they rarely experienced at home. She looked at him and said, ""You want to be somewhere else now, don't you?""""Why can't you relax at home like this?"" He shot out and stopped himself. She stiffened.""What do you mean?""""Why don't you relax like this normally? Why do you have to work all the time?"" he finished the thought.""Because you work too little. Come on, let's go get some ice cream, at least you'll get a break from the sun for a while,"" she suggested.At that moment, he pouted like a cat. She ordered a hazelnut flavoured ice cream. He watched her lick the first layer of the runny substance with her tongue, and with each successive lick, he could feel the anger building inside him. So, he wasn't working enough? If he worked so little, they wouldn't even be here, he thought angrily in his mind. A scooter drove past them, and Thomas wished for nothing more than to knock its driver to the ground, grab the bike, drive to the other side of Italy and drink himself into a stupor. Instead, he continued to watch his girlfriend dangerously dispose of an enormous portion of the sweet icy substance.He was about to take a breath to tell her everything he'd ever missed when suddenly Stella said, ""Thanks for bringing me here. It's great here, and this ice cream tastes like Nutella, but it's even a little better, you know? It tastes like the rest I haven't had in a thousand years."" About three quarters of a year later, he stood in the kitchen doorway and watched Stella with suppressed enthusiasm as she slammed down another glass of Nutella. This time he felt he had found a surprise that would pull Stella out of her daily stress and overwhelmed state. A surprise with a story behind it far more powerful than the one Stella taps into her computer daily to satisfy the dubious fantasies of her superiors. With one day left until Valentine's Day, he left Stella in her anxiety, laid in bed, and looked for a place in Prague to get ice cream with the same exact flavour that had managed to stop Stella for a fleeting moment. He found out a lot of interesting things about it. Gianduja, as Stella's ice cream flavour was called, refers to a sweet chocolate spread that contains about 30% hazelnut paste. It was invented in Turin in the 18th century during Napoleon's regency. At the time, Europe was governed by the Continental System, introduced by Napoleon in 1806, which prevented British goods from entering European ports under French control. The result was a shortage of cocoa supplies. The Turin chocolatier Michele Prochet therefore mixed the little chocolate he had with hazelnuts from the Langhe hills south of Turin. Some historical sources consider it to be the basis of today's Nutella. But Thomas couldn't find any ice cream parlours serving the same flavour in Bohemia. So, when he came home from work on February 14, he took off his shirt and pants, pulled on his pyjamas and headed straight to bed. He was awakened only by the sound of a spoon dropped on the floor a few hours later by Stella as she was taking another empty Nutella jar to the sink."
The Golden Teapot,"Egret and Heron sat at opposite sides of the small table in the parlor of their castle.In the center of the table sat a gleaming silver tea set consisting of a pot with more curves than their mother, two cups with fancy scrolled handles, saucers, a creamer with tiny lions feet, and a sugar bowl. The noon suns rays plunged through the tall, multi-paned windows and dazzling white reflections from every shiny surface buffeted round the room like a light-filled kaleidoscope.The handle of the sugar spoon was an eagle with a garnet eye. The merlot-colored gemstone flashed crimson, emulating the fire in the girls eyes as they glared at each other with tight, grim lips.Egret, who was ten, at last broke the silence and said, Try a scone dear sister.I helped Miss Dorothy make them just this morning. Her eyes widened to parodies of innocence.Heron, who was nine, said, No thank you dearest Egret.I do not care for scones.At nine, she was a twin reflection of her sister.She willed her own doe-like eyes to remain carefree.She used to like scones quite a lot, especially the ones with small bittersweet chips of chocolate in them, like the ones taunting her from the table.The week before, shed been halfway through eating one when a foul taste in her mouth made her gag.Egret had fallen to the floor in a fit of uncontrollable laughter.Between her annoying giggles shed said, Not all small brown chips are always chocolate.Their mother was sick to death of their sibling rivalry, when Egret had snitched, shed said, You are sisters.You should be best friends.These negative feelings between you two are wasting precious moments youll never have again.Heron hated to see her mother so distressed, it made her guts curl and shrivel up like a dying snake on the end of an iron stake.She tried to be good but inevitably found herself playing pranks to get even.As footsteps approached the parlor door, Heron patted the pinned-up braids in her deep auburn hair, checked her fingernails again, and smoothed the pale green silk of her simple gown.Egret did likewise, like a mirror image except hers was a gown of magenta, with sparkling beads and emerald embroidery.Egret liked fancy things.Heron would have preferred squires britches and poet blouses.Under her long skirt she wore tan leather riding boots and now she made sure they were tucked completely underneath.Naturally, her sister crossed her legs and a bright pink satin slipper bobbed coquettishly, the gems and sequins flashing in the sunlight.Their mother swooped into the parlor in a regal swirl of cream-colored silk.Her dark hair flowed freely down her back, pinned up at the sides with topaz hair clips.Herons palms dampened and her scalp itched fiercely, as if turned to a nest of fire ants.She should have known Mother would come to tea.Since last weeks horrendous prank, shed been checking in on her wayward daughters more frequently.Evenline DAmoressy sat gracefully on a shantung covered seat between them.Well, its nice to see you two properly honoring the Balmoral Circle Ceremony.With no teasing and shrieking and what-not.Queen DAmoressy pulled Egrets cup to her place setting and eyed the scones suspiciously.Egret said, The scones are fine.Ive been good and proper all week Mother.Pour  a cup and lets enjoy each others company.Heron willed a calm voice and said, Mother, wouldnt you like my cup instead?Mine is hotter.Sweetheart, you know to pass to the left when a new guest sits at the table.Egret reached to the tea cart, daintily chose another cup, and positioned it in place with the handle facing right.It was her turn to host, so she offered the cream and sugar counterclockwise, first to her sister, then to her mother.When it was apparent that her mother intended to stay for the duration of the tea ceremony, Heron feigned illness.With pinkie out, Evenline sipped then said, There is nothing better for an upset tummy than a nice Earl Grey.After fifteen minutes, she sipped again.Then frowned.She studied the remaining liquid in her cup.She gagged, stood hastily, and ran from the room with a hand over her mouth.Egret looked into the cup and grinned.Ohhhhhhyoure in big trouble now!In the bottom of the cup was a fat brown Pukebug.Later that evening, when Queen DAmoressy felt no more waves of nausea, she summoned her daughters and got to the truth.Heron had attempted retaliation for the scone incident after promising no more pranks.As punishment, I am sending you to Grebeldas tower. You will remain there until your father comes home. The girls sucked in breath.Egret, stop gloating, its unbecoming of a princess.Heron said, But Auntie Greb is crazy andandFatherEveline silenced her with the look of a coiled viper and the unfinished lament buzzed in the room like a deadly excreta fly.Had Heron finished her plea, it would have been, The queen said, It is true Greb is a tad bit eccentric.But she is world traveled and the one who brought us the Balmoral Circle Tea Ceremony, all the way from far eastern Xaxang.You went too far this afternoon, young lady, and poisoned the actual  itself.Shame on you. Greb will teach you to respect the ceremony.In the top of the highest tower, Heron sat across from a very old woman.Greb passed a tray of lemon bars to her left as Heron passed the sugar to  left.Greb stirred the tea to make sure it had steeped to just the right rich amber color.Her bony wrist a stark white contrast to the soft woven black gown she favored.The worn ivory lace of her undershift ruffled from her neckline.Heron wore a long green velvet vest over her chemise and dark tights.At least she was more comfortable and did not have to hide her old tan boots. She wore her auburn tresses loose like her mother.You are the spitting image of Evenline! Declared Greb.Although shed never be caught dead in a mans britches.Ho ho hoooo!I am so happy to be allowed to be me. I always assumed you were sent here by Father because you were insane, but now I think I understand that you  to live up here.Its peaceful here, and lovelyno rot, no filth, no angst, no fearShe turned to the tall tea service cabinet in the wall by the ten-foot west window.It was built into the stone wall and held a shelf of four beautiful tea pots, two were of fine China, two were of silver.The shelf below it held sixteen cups and sixteen saucers.On the bottom shelf were assorted serving dishes, plates, creamers, and sugar bowls.High above Herons head was the top shelf which seemed empty.On Herons tenth birthday, tea was served at four.At four, the sun came into the tower parlor window sideways.Something glowed like amber fire on the top shelf, just out of sight.Greb put an assortment of special treats on the table and asked Heron to choose her favorite teapot and settings.She turned around in time to see Heron pull down a golden teapot, glowing like a lantern in the sun.Oh, Auntie GrebStop! Dont touch that thing!Heron jumped and the golden teapot flew from her fingers like a chicken escaping the chopping block.Grebelda wasnt ninety anymore, but twenty, as she caught the teapot deftly, and, holding only the spout and edge of its ornately scrolled handle, she placed it on the bottom ledge.Shaking, Heron said, I-Im sorry.Its so Its also very dangerous.Never, NEVER touch it again.ButGrebelda silenced her with a withering look.She pulled a chair over and put the forbidden teapot back on the top shelf, pushing it until it touched the back wall.They finished setting the table in silence.Long life and sweet tea.And a very happy birthday to you.The old woman said.Long life and sweet tea, Auntie.They sipped.You were only half correct when you surmised my reasons for living up here.The other reason I do so is to protect the entity of the teapot.It must never, EVER fall into the wrong hands.Unleashed, it is a force of fury so great, all in its way is destroyed.Never, EVER caress the belly of the pot.To look upon its golden surface is to be possessed, the pot will sing to you the sweetest lullaby.Your mind will be lost if you listen long enough.Heron looked up to the top shelf.The suns rays had moved on and had taken the magical glow with it.Grebelda smacked the table for her attention, the sound like a pistol shot.Have a chocolate macaroon, they were your favorite when you were little.Heron accepted.She didnt look to the top shelf again but late that night, in her bed, the teapot did indeed sing to her.And continued to beckon to her every night thereafter.Its voice was melodic, soft, yet reassuring Free me my love it sang.I will save you if you save me, it sang.She had no idea what that meant.The pleasant days flew by, the end of summer brought wild banshee hurricanes.High in the tower she watched people flee for cover, hanging on to what little they possessed. She watched the yard turn from soupy brown muck to a roiling brown lake.Heron read and studied and practiced her shot with her longbow and arrows, taking aim at inanimate objects- carts, trees, wagons.Through every season, every night, the teapot sang its beckoning song.It had become a lullaby that sweetened her dreams with imaginings of its singer.She pictured a tall, broad-shouldered prince on a magnificent shiny black steed.Hed have peridot green eyes and dark curly hair.On the last day of spring, a thunder of hoofbeats arose and found the tower window.Heron rushed to it.Father!!Go on child.Go welcome your father. Her aunt was smiling, but sadness tinged her eyes darkly.Out on the field, Egret and her mother were helping her father off his mount.The horse was near collapsing, a stable-hand led the weary beast away.The other knights were dismounting, and Heron counted only twenty of them.There had been two thousand the year before.She ran to her father who was falling heavily against Evenline.Two of their manservants unburdened the queen before she toppled under the weight.The kings body oozed thick, gooey blood from too many perforations.His chainmail hung like swampmoss from his stooped, shrunken body.Blood pattered to the dirt.The queen shouted to her, Go boil some water!Fill the tub!Have Donny fetch the surgeon!Im here my queen, said an old man in a long deep blue robe, his soft white beard wafting in the chilly wind as he spoke.Heron saw the fear in his eyes and braced herself for the inevitable.Egret was a statue with streams flowing from her eyes.Her hair had come undone, and her pale dress was soaked with blood.Heron touched her sisters arm and said, Hes not coming back.Hes---Oh shut up!What do  know?! Egret whirled and strode off, followed by a young handsome knight.Heron followed slowly, tears falling from her hanging head.In the castle, she sat in the masculine parlor outside her fathers closed door.Her mother came and put her arms around her.She softly said, Welcome home darling.Heron hugged her mother.The queen stood again and turned towards the closed door.She frowned at Heron and said, What in Petas name are you wearing?You look like a boy.Egret barked a laugh.The queen shook her head and mumbled, Nevermind.Well discuss your homecoming later. She went to the door, and just as she was about to lever the handle, it opened, and a tall figure in blue slowly shook his white bearded head.Evenline squawked like gut-shot goose and ran into the room.The surgeon closed the door behind her.Though the door was two inches thick, Evenlines wails reverberated in the gloomy parlor like a loons cry on a lonely lake.Heron slipped out from the castle unnoticed and climbed the tower stairs as fast as she could, the pounding in her heart overtook her booted footfalls.At the top, she nearly collapsed from exertion, her breath escaped her lungs like cannon-fire.Her aunt was fastening a soft, long cloak around her bony shoulders.She was not surprised in the least to see Heron back.Heron, still panting, said, Fathers dead.Grebelda nodded.Yes. Stay here in the tower, you will be safe.Theres a black storm coming.Reginald only lived long enough to warn us.Before she could enquire about any of the mystical vocalizations, Grebelda was gone.She never returned.At dawn, Heron awoke from a dazed, not-quite-sleep, to the sounds of battle cries.She looked out the window.The fields to the north were black with soldiers like thousands of chitinous- coated ants. The wind changed direction and she heard the hoofbeats and clanging of armor and weaponry.The tower servant was bringing her more arrows, she could see him in the yard, prying the old arrows from wagons and carts.Her fathers army had been decimated.There was no hope.The guards at the gate were bowled over like tin soldiers when the iron-fisted battering column broke through.The soldiers in black swept through the yard like a plague, indiscriminate and blood thirsty.She saw their faces smiling and laughing  their enemy was dead; the castle was theirs.Heron pulled the bowstring surely, her left arm a solid mast, and the laughing face of a Satans minion split in the forehead, under the force of her specialized dragonstone arrowhead.She wasted no time between firing and did so like a machine.Her aim was true and after fourteen kills, shed been discovered.Black Satans spawns surged towards the tower.She looked straight down and saw that six-foot building stones had been piled against the only entrance..She continued slaying the attackers, ignoring all thoughts of her family, for they were surely gone.She watched as the servant boys body was trampled to rust-brown paste at the stones.  She swallowed back down the bile-like cry.She had forty arrows left and needed a clear head to make each one count. And they did.Useless as it was.Throughout the night, after shed run out of arrows, shed only been able to watch in horror as everything turned to blood and ash.Eventually, she knew theyd come for her.In the safety of her tower, she gave in to fatigue.All she could do was take each minute at a time, as hopeless as those minutes seemed.She slept against the windowsill.As always, the handsome princes lullaby swept deliciously through her head.In her dreams of him she said, I must leave you now my prince.I am surely doomed, death awaits me by the morns lonely path.The lullaby turned to a violent barrage of an opera singers baritone voice so powerful it reverberated in the stone walls.Heron was alarmed to find she was not dreaming but fully awake, yet the voice of the teapot raged.It said the same things as always, I will save you if you save me!She ran to the tea cupboard, dragged a chair over, and stood with arms outstretched.She felt the teapot and brushed it closer with her fingers.She pulled it out with a hand on the spout and the other on the handle.Moonlight caught the golden surface as she descended the chair.At the table she placed both hands alongside the teapot.It should have been cool to the touch but was warm as if filled with hot tea.She held the teapot in both hands to her body, caressing its silken warmth.The air inside the tower whirled like a golden dust-storm.It poured from the spout in glittering mica whorls, and she couldnt breathe.Around the glittering, tornado swirls, the voice shed heard for a year laughed. She wasnt afraid.Why should she be?She was to die at the dawn of the next day.Heron whirled around the room, dancing her last dance with her fantasy prince.The golden dust settled, and she saw it was not actually a prince that had sang to her, but a freaking, incredible golden dragon!The golden dragon was twelve feet tall with leathery wings tucked against its body.He did have peridot green eyes however, and said, It is dawn.You saved me. I save you. He lowered his scaly, golden body down and she climbed up between his wings.The dragon said, Im Harold by the way. As he swooped from the window over the decimated courtyard.Everyone in the yard was burnt to a crisp as well as anyone dumb enough to run out of the castle itself.THE ENDFor now"
Cat in a Candy Store,"Pepper peeked out from under the counter and groaned as he spied the woman setting up the Hallmark display with heart adorned cards. The woman was Candace and she owned Candys Sweet Shoppe.Pepper the rats ash grey fur puffed and his white whiskers bristled uncontrollably.They did that when he was annoyed.Pepper scurried across the pink linoleum beneath the counter, across the floor to under the shelves.From there he was able to see the calendar on the wall. .He dramatically held a pink paw to his forehead. A flash of white caught his eye just outside the door..She was the shop cat that lived in the bookstore across the cobblestoned street.He watched as she slinked over it gracefully.She patiently waited at the bookshops door until it was opened.The fingers of a small pale hand curled around the doorframe like starfish legs clinging to a rock and pulled it shut.It was the hand of the young boy who helped the man run the store.The man could only be the boys father- same shaggy dark hair, same wideset brown eyes, same animated way they flapped their hands when they talked.Pepper daydreamed.He would have killed for a boy of his own.He suddenly felt exposed and looked behind him.Candace came around the counter towards the shelves with an armload of heartsy, cutesy, stuffed animals.She was wearing her readers down low on her freckled nose, her hair a frothy red mop pinned up by butterfly barrettes.Her blue eyes peered over the eyeglass frames and grew huge and round when she spied Pepper.Woman and rat froze.Then Candace broke her paralysis and screamed like a factory steam whistle at days end.Simultaneously, she threw the small, plush animals into the air.They plopped and bounced all around Pepper- puppies, kittens, a fluffy green alligator, a ladybug bonked Peppers noggin.He shook his head, zig-zagged through the stuffed toy fallout (noting that there were no rat toys) and zipped across the floor to his little hole underneath the counter where he lived.   The next day Candace brought a cat to the candy store.He was an orange tabby with deep pumpkin-colored stripes, the same shade as Candaces soft plentitude of curls.Here you go Killer, said Candace as she lowered a small bowl of milk to the floor.She placed it next to the counter and as the cat lapped lazily it purred.It looked up, white droplets pattered off its whiskers, the purring ceased.It sniffed at the hole and growled like a miniature tiger.Killer crouched with ears perked forward, staring into the hole.At last, two hours later, it got up and padded to the front door.He sat and his head traveled from left to right slowly.Curious, Pepper skittered to the bookshelves, Killers whiskers twitched at the faint ticking noises made by the rats tiny claws.But he didnt turn around.He was mesmerized by the sleek white feline slinking down the sidewalk across the street.When the bookstore door opened, and Fredrica went inside the darkened doorway, Killer snapped out of it and turned around.Pepper ran under the shelves, darted under the counter, and he couldnt help squealing with fright as he felt the ground behind him pound with heavy cat feet in hot pursuit.He made it to safety.But he felt like he was having a heart attack.The orange tabby was fast, the floor was slick, and the cat whumped into the counter, rattling the sliding glass doors in the back.The cat paced the length of the front counter.Pepper had an idea.He raced back to the shelves.Killer heard the tippy-tapping and hurried after the sneaky rat.Pepper crawled up the back of the shelving and came out on the third shelf.The cat leapt to the shelf and swiped at the rat who ducked out of reach.Killer knocked three stuffed toys to the ground.Then three more.After a pile of books clattered down, Heels clicked on the floor from the office in the back.Killer!What on earth?What  you done? Candaces voice was shrilly as she took in the mess.Youre supposed to kill the rat.Not destroy the store.Grrrr.Pepper giggled as he climbed to the top shelf.He had a stash of candy up there and was safely out of reach.After dark, Candace closed the shop for the day.She put a plate of sardines by the milk bowl and turned the lights off on her way out the door.Killer stopped scarfing up the fish and looked towards the sound.He frowned at the package of gummy bears lying on the floor in front of the door.His eyes grew soft and glistening as he caught the glow of white fur across the street.He went to the window in the door and stared as the lovely feline licked her paws and cleaned her face. tiny footfalls.Killer turned as the long, leathery rat tail disappeared under the shelves.He went to his dinner.The plate was licked clean.Meeeeeooooooowwwwrrrr! He howled in frustration.  The next day when Candace was occupied in the office, Pepper scurried like an ash being blown across the floor.Killer chased after.The rat squiggled under the metal revolving card rack then under the counter.The cat slid over the polished pink floor and straight into the rack.It toppled over in a jangling, twanging, pile of metal rods and crumpled cards.Oh come on! Killer slunk to the corner, head hung low, he looked like a sad orange gargoyle.Candace sighed and said, I thought you were a mousererratter?Youre more trouble than the rat!   That night Candace left a plate of mackerel for the cat who had sulked in the corner behind the counter all day..Killer padded silently on orange pom-pom feet to the door.He sat next to the colorful package of sour worms and watched the white cat at the bookstore.Without turning around, Killer said, Help yourself.Im not hungry.Pepper looked up, surprised, his eyes glittered like black beads as they caught the dim streetlight outside.His cheeks were full like fat, fuzzy grey walnuts; he swallowed, , and studied the cat.And why would I want to eat you anyways?I like fish.And chickenturkeys good too.Not rat.Yuck.Fur and whiskers and teeth?Hmmf. The cat looked sideways towards the rat, as if he was keeping one eye on the rat and one on the white cat.Youre not messing with me?Killer shrugged.Meh.He turned towards the window again.The angel was gone.Her names Fredrica.The boy calls her Freddy.Killers ears perked up.He said in a dreamy low voice, Shes sooo beautiful. So ask her out.Killer jumped when he realized the rat was sitting next to him.He said, shed never like an ole tom like me.Women love wooing.Cats are no different.What do you mean by woo?Dude, look around this place.All this heartsy, cutesy crap, Pepper said, his mouth in a downward grimace.He added, Its pure commercial poop.Humans spend boocoo bucks on it.Especially now, its Valentines season.Ugh.I hate the color pink.And all this foo-fooey stuffmakes my eyeballs bleed.Killer was looking at the rat blankly, like the rat was giving a sermon on Greek or something.The rat studied the cats face and realized hed been ranting.He took a deep breath and said,  can take advantage of it though.Killer looked dubious.Pepper said, Ill help you.Lets make a deal.Ill help you win Freddys heart, and you dont slaughter me.The cat said, but if I dont kill you, Candace will toss me out for sure.Aw heck.I can find a new place.Ive been eating candy all my life and am priii-teee sick of it.Im more of a saltytype.The rat waited patiently for the cat to process what he was trying to tell him.He could practically hear the rusty cogs and wheels turning in Killers head.After a minute, Killer smiled and said, Youre saying I can woo Fredrica with this Valentines stuff?Pepper said, Chicks dig it.They get all googly eyed and mooshy, even feline chicks.Seen it a million times.He suppressed a gag.Well start tomorrow. Now go eat your fish, you can have the rest.Really? said the cat sarcastically, my own dinner?Gee thanks.The omegas are great for a silky coat.Pepper sat up and smoothed down his white belly.   The next day, Pepper was extra careful to stay out of sight.Perhaps if the woman didnt see him, shed let up on Killer a bit.That night, after the shop was closed, he came out and sat with Killer in the shadows under the shelves.Killer excitedly said, Oh, here she comes. His orange fur bristled as if each strand was alive and ready to take off into orbit.Peppers own pulse perked up along with his ears.He was having fun with this.Fredricas silky fur glowed bluey in the merry white light of the big moon.They watched as the luminescent cat across the street approached the bouquet of flowers on the bookshops doorstep.They drooped a bit and a pale petal drifted to her feet as Fredrica picked them up and studied the pretty blooms.Pepper had picked them from the brick sidewalk planter from the store next door and wrapped the stems in some of the candy shops bright pink tissue paper.She looked down both sides of the street, the boys sucked in breath as her eyes lingered on the candy shops glass paned door.Then her own door opened behind her a crack.The cobblestoned street was more of an alley, it was in the boutiquey section of town only accessible to pedestrians.From forty feet away they heard the young boy say, Why Miss Freddy, ah do declare you have an admirer.Pepper elbowed Killer and gave him a tiny thumbs up.  The next night, the cat and rat covertly watched as Frederica inspected the mini heart shaped box of chocolates on the doorstep.Instead of chocolates, the rat had filled it with sardine heads and anchovy tails.It had a pawprint on the red flocked top lid.This time she looked around smiling, with a snow-white paw pressed to her chest.   The third night, the white cat came home to find a plush stuffed woodchuck with a little pink (of course) shirt that said on it, Id chop for you.Killer had raised his brows at Pepper over that one.Pepper only said, Corny. Yes.But loveable to chicks.Besidesjust watchFredrica tossed the toy in the air, squealing with delight.She hugged it and nuzzled it with her grinning cheeks.Pepper said, thats the catnip.That morning Pepper had stuffed some of the dried leaves into it.Killer had only raised his brows when Pepper had brought the cat contraband back early that morning.He had said, where did you find it?Pepper shrugged and said, I have my ways, my friend. I am a rat after all. Now, as Killer spied on the white cat, he waited for her to settle down.Apparently, catnip was like cat pot.Fredrica lay on her belly embracing the fuzzy toy.Then she sat up and looked around, apparently, shed noticed something else.Killer looked at Pepper expectantly.Pepper grinned back.Both friends looked out the window.Fredrica had rolled over the card.The clincher.She picked it up and read it.Then re-read it.Her white fur glowed like an ice-covered glacial lake, she looked like a spectral wood nymph as she twirled in the moonlight. The bookstore door opened, and the dark-haired boy came out and observed the cats odd behavior.He watched her as she pranced into the bookstore.The boy looked around, but the narrow street was empty.He shrugged then followed the cat inside.The card, ironically, had been one off the metal rack that had caused Killer so much grief the week before.It was goofy.At least Pepper thought so, but he had convinced Killer that it would be the final Valentinelike the cherry on the top of a sundae.Both rat and cat had agreed that Killer should not actually sign his name. That could only end up having her screaming and hiding in her closet the rest of her nine lives.He left another pawprint and  The red-haired woman had not seen the rat for days.She was so happy that she put a cat door in place of the bathroom window at the back of the shop.Ten minutes before midnight, Killer went out it and sat on the step in front of Candys Sweet Life.Pepper hid in the brick planter fifteen feet away.At exactly twelve, the white feline came around the corner from the top of the street.She looked nervous; the tip of her tail twitched like the Queens white-gloved wave.Killer stood as she approached and said, Hello Fredrica.You look beautiful as always.Um, my names Killer.Uh, not like in Lady or Serial!But---Fredrica laughed.Thats funny.Call me Freddy.Hey, you wanna come over for some warm milk?There is nothing I would rather do.Killer looked towards the planter where Pepper watched.He walked past him towards the bookstore.He gave the rat a thumbs up.Pepper felt a twinge of loneliness though he wished his friend well.  A few days laterWere in love, in love, in LOVE! expressed the orange cat as he leapt about the pink frilly store.It worked!I love Valentines Day. He was acting like a kitten discovering a tiny bouncing red light flicking here and there.Killer stopped frolicking when he noticed the sadness in his friend.He said, Come with me.Peppers little grey legs skittered quickly to keep up with the cats long strides.At the step across the street, the door opened, and Freddy came out to nuzzle Killers face.The dark-haired boy of about ten goggled in surprise when he saw the rat.His freckled, dimpled face broke into an ear-to-ear grin as he dropped to his knees and bent with his hands open.Killer said to Pepper, Its okay.Hes waited a long time for this.He ran into the boys hands and smiled at the giant face with the huge eyes. He was whirled around like a kid in a Tiltawhirl carnival ride.The big, grown-up version of the boy came out to see what had caused all the commotion.The boy let Pepper scamper up his arm.He giggled as Pepper snuggled against his neck and said, can I keep him?Huh Dad?Can I?Pleeeeeeeeeeze!The man studied the rat.It was looking back at the man just as intently, as if holding its breath.At last, the man said, Well, theres something special about him thats for sure.Sure son.I suppose Valentines gifts are meant for all kinds of loved ones, eh?"
"Chamomile, It Helps","The soft whistling sound and the sight of steam emerging from the stainless steel tea kettle was what captured Charmaine Wilsons attention. Her barefeet softly padded against the wood floors, the legs of her plaid pajama bottoms whispered softly against the floor. She made her way to the stove and turned the silver knob, causing the small red light to disappear. Her fingers then curled around the handle of the kettle as she removed the appliance from the stove ring. She moved quietly around the kitchen, working in the dim light provided by the small light fixture which was displayed above the sink. Her fingers curled around the porcelain mug as she moved the object to the marble surface of her counter. She placed a small tea packet into the mug before pouring the boiling hot water into the small mug. Bubbles formed, steam rushed into the air. She put the kettle down onto the counter then simply leaned against the counter as she pulled the navy blue cardigan around her tank top and pajama bottoms combo a little more. Maybe a nice hot cup of  tea would help her sleep tonight. Sometimes the cases that she and her squad worked would get to her. She loved working in law enforcement. She had no doubt that it was her calling; that she was meant to be a driving force in this male dominated industry. She and her squad had a case closure rate that surpassed any other unit within the FBI, all because of how fiercely dedicated they all were to the job of bringing home endangered individuals. Charmaine was often praised for her ability to lead her squad; the way she always stood her ground, the way she took absolutely no nonsense, the way she would work until a case was solved. But then there were cases like their latest one: a case that ended up being a recovery rather than a rescue mission. An innocent four year old child that had been so cruelly snatched from her own front yard, only to be transported across the state line and found dead in an abandoned house, nearly a hundred miles away from her home. Charmaine struggled with cases like these where an innocent child was involved. The thought of anything happening to a child was too much to bear, but she had managed to keep a rather stoic expression throughout the recovery portion. She had learned to keep it together during these tough cases. She had learned not to fall apart when conducting notifications. She had learned to not react in anger when interrogating the sickest criminals. But it was when she returned home to DC that she allowed herself to just feel, and to fall apart. Since returning to her DC apartment, her mind had been flooded with images of the four year old girl: the bruises, the evidence of strangulation. Filth surrounded the child, and yet, she looked as though she was sleeping. She didnt look scared. She just looked like she was sleeping. Everytime Charmaine tried to close her eyes, the image of this child flooded her mind. If she allowed her mind to wander as she lay in the silence, she swore she could hear the screams of the heartbroken mother that flooded the air when they delivered the gut-wrenching news. If she stared into the darkness for too long, she swore she could see the sinister smirk of scumbag theyd arrested for this heinous crime. And now all of that led to this moment: her standing in the small kitchen of her apartment, leaned against the kitchen counter, making a small cup of Chamomile tea. She glanced at the glowing green digital clock on the stove: Five minutes had passed; her tea was ready. She removed the bag and tossed it into the trash, then proceeded to add a little honey and sugar to her tea. As she stirred the contents of her mug, the only sound to be heard was a soft clink sound as the silver spoon tapped the inside of the mug with each twirl. She was staring intently at the light grey marble tile of the wall, slowly losing herself in her thoughts once more until- Charm, what you doing, baby? Her thought bubble shattered as the deep voice filtered into her ears. She looked over her shoulder, only to find her boyfriend Thomas making his way towards her. Exhaustion was evident as he stepped closer, only clad in a pair of sweatpants that he often kept at her apartment. She knew he was just as tired as she was; after all, days of working a case left little room for them to sleep. However, he could sometimes handle cases better than she could. Sometimes he could push the images from his mind and just succumb to exhaustion, like he had done tonight. Charmaine offered a small smile; Im making tea. At four in the morning? I havent slept, Charmaine shrugged a little as she took the spoon out of her drink; Sometimes when I cant sleep, I drink some tea and cry a little, and then Im good. Thomas hummed in understanding while nodding his head. He figured that this had affected Charmaine on a deep level. He didnt miss the way she was so quiet on the plane, absently staring out the window with her brow furrowed. She was quiet during the ride back to her apartment, quiet as they settled in for the night. Thomas stroked his fingers against her waist and pressed a tender kiss to the side of her head. Do you want to talk about it? he inquired. Not right now, baby; I just want to sit down and drink my tea. Thomas nodded his head. They made their way over to the stools of the kitchen island and sat beside each other. The silence wasnt awkward but it wasnt comfortable either. Charmaine was trying to relax and Thomas didnt want to push her. They were silent for a few moments then she spoke; I keep a box of Chamomile in the cabinet; bring it out after the bad cases, like this latest one. Thomas nodded as he looked at her; Does it help? Always does. They fell into silence again. Her fingers were curled around the mug as she brought it to her lips for another sip. The drink was warm as it ran down her throat. She and Thomas didnt really need to talk right now. Sometimes, they needed to just sit in silence. So they did. They sat in silence. They silently processed how they were feeling. Thomas kept a comforting hand on her back while she sipped her tea. They both knew this case hadnt turned out the way they had hoped, but they had gotten another monster off the streets and that was a win in somebodys eyes. Charmaine finished her tea before pushing the mug aside. She turned on the stool, her knee bumping against Thomass leg as she spoke; Lets try this sleeping thing again. Thomas chuckled a little, tilting his head as he gazed at her; You sure? Charmaine gave a soft nod of the head. Chamomile; it helps.Thomas simply smiled before standing up along with her. She put her mug in the sink and made sure all appliances and lights were switched off, then she and Thomas made their way back to her room. As he climbed into bed, she tossed her sweater aside before climbing into bed with him. His strong arms slipped around her slender frame, and she found herself resting her head on his chest.It was nearly five in the morning now, and she was thankful that they had today off to rest. She took a deep breath before closing her eyes. Maybe the chamomile tea would help. Maybe her thoughts would finally relax long enough so she could go to sleep."
The Sultan's Daughter,"There lived long ago a sultan of a great kingdom-on-the-mountain. But it happened that the kingdom entered war with another, and the tide of the conflict threatened to take everything from the sultan. In order to survive, the sultan sought help from three powerful princes. The sultan first sought help from the prince in the north, whose subjects called him the vain prince. The vain prince sent many beautiful cloaks, furs, and boots to warm the sultans soldiers. In return, the sultan promised the hand of his eldest daughter in marriage. The sultan next sought help from the prince in the east, whose subjects called him the gluttonous prince. The gluttonous prince sent many fat lambs, cows, and chickens to feed the sultans soldiers. In return, the sultan again promised the hand of his eldest daughter in marriage. Finally, the sultan sought help from the prince in the south, whose subjects called him the greedy prince. The greedy prince sent chests of silver, copper, and jewels to pay the sultans soldiers. In return, the sultan once more promised the hand of his eldest daughter in marriage. With the aid of the three princes, the tide of the war slowly turned. For twelve long years the sultan fought, but finally there came a day when the fighting was finished and the war was won. The queen came to congratulate her husband and share in the joy of peace, but she was surprised to find him distraught. ""Dear husband, why are you so worried? Should we not celebrate the happy end of the long war?"" she asked. The sultan replied, ""Dear wife, I fear more fighting may soon begin. To keep our soldiers warm, I promised the vain prince our eldest daughters hand in marriage. And to keep our soldiers fed, I promised the gluttonous prince our eldest daughters hand in marriage. And to keep our soldiers paid, I promised the greedy prince our eldest daughters hand in marriage. I fear that tomorrow, the three princes will come up the mountain to claim what they are owed!"" And upon hearing these words, the queen joined her husband in grief, and wept, for she knew that they had no daughter. *** On the day the suitors were due to arrive, the sultan sought help from his trusted vizier. The vizier was known for being very clever, and for solving impossible problems. The vizier quickly devised a plan, and the sultans fears were calmed. The vain prince arrived first. He wore a fine silk robe and his sword was polished to a mirror shine so that he could always see his reflection. The prince entered the sultans throne room and said, I have come for your eldest daughters hand in marriage. The vizier replied, The princess is eager to meet you. But please be humble, she lost an eye and a leg during the great war, and may look frightening. We will go fetch her, and the vizier left with the sultan, but when they returned the vain prince had already fled. Next arrived the gluttonous prince. He was as wide as the chamber door, and ate from each hand two meticulously seasoned turkey legs. The prince entered the sultans throne room and said, I have come for your eldest daughters hand in marriage. The vizier replied, The princess is eager to meet you. But please be temperate, she loves to cook and has prepared her favorite soup for you: horsehair and lime, and she prays you will enjoy it. We will go fetch her, and the vizier left with the sultan, but when they returned the gluttonous prince had already fled. Finally, the greedy prince arrived. He wore an ornate crown larger than his own head and, as he walked, servants unfurled rich velvet beneath his feet. The prince entered the sultans throne room and said, I have come for your eldest daughters hand in marriage. The vizier replied, The princess is eager to meet you. But please be charitable, all of her dowry was spent on the long war, and now she is as poor as a beggar-maid. We will go fetch her, and the vizier left with the sultan, but when they returned the greedy prince had already fled. With the three princes gone, the sultan was overjoyed, and planned a great feast to celebrate. But the feast would not be a happy one, for there was only one road down the great mountain, and it happened that the three princes came upon one another, and they fell into conversation. I was to be married, but I learned that the bride was terribly ugly, so I fled, said the vain prince. I was to be married, but I learned that the bride was a terrible cook, so I fled, said the gluttonous prince. I was to be married, but I learned that the bride was terribly impoverished, so I fled, said the greedy prince. But for their faults, the three princes were not stupid, and they soon realized that they had been tricked by the same vizier. They grew angry and resolved to get answers from the sultan for his deception. So the three princes rode back up the mountain together, and they came upon the sultan enjoying a great feast with music, dancing, and wine. The musicians stopped playing at the sight of the three princes and a silence fell over the hall. What an ugly lie! said one prince. That behavior was disgusting! said another. Your promises have no worth! said the third. The three princes continued to express their anger while the sultan solemnly listened. Finally, they demanded that the sultan fetch his eldest daughter without delay, or they would bring war to the kingdom-on-the-mountain. The sultan, finally breaking his silence, realized that he could do nothing but be honest. He turned to the princes and spoke these words:"
Few and Far Between,"He fell again, my husband mouths to me, then returns to his phone call with his-brother-who-I-cannot-stand. No, no. Im right here. I can be there in twenty minutes.Thats what martyrs do.My husband paces, phone still in hand. Did the doctors say anything elsewhat caused the fall?, I say to myself. He has a urinary tract infection, too? My husband looks shocked that his fathers poor lifestyle choices have had a negative impact on his health..I want to say, but at this point in our marriage, weve had too many conversations about the same things. Ive learned its better to say nothing. Eggshells can only be walked on for so long.My husband hangs up the phone and starts to get dressed.Sorry I woke you up, he apologizes, but the apology is insincere. He wants me to commiserate with him, but Im not playing this game at 3:00 a.m. I have my own problems. I have to get up and change the sheets anyway, I mutter.Night sweats?Yup, I pull off a pillow case. Maybe try hormone therapy?, I want to say, but I conjure up an icy smile which looks suspiciously like a grimace. ?I love you, he says, giving me a perfunctory kiss.I love you, too, I reply, wondering for a second if I really do.He leaves for the hospital.I luxuriate in his absence until 4:17 a.m.Mom! MOM!My eyes open before the second time my name is called. Its our youngest. Shes weeping, mascara and eyeliner running down her puffy face in black rivulets. Shes blubbering, incomprehensible and hysterical.Whatwhats going on? I say, getting out of bed, finding a robe, knocking over a glass of water.Mom, I wrecked the car . . . I. Wrecked. The. Car. She caterwauls, falling into my arms. She smells of alcohol, tobacco, and my perfume, which disappeared from my vanity last month. Slow down. Tell me what happened.I hand her a box of tissues and she blows her nose.I wait, wrapping a thick fleece blanket around myself. After my perimenopausal night sweats, I expect to get the chillsand they arrive as advertised.Okay, dont get mad, she starts.This preface to her confession is when I know its going to be expensive.Are you all right?Im all right, but the car is t-totaled! A new round of sobbing begins.I pat her on the back, wondering if I can put her in a warm bath then go downstairs to eat a pint of ice cream. Any flavor. Doesn't matter.Tell me exactly what happened, I pull back, looking into her tragic, raccoon eyes. I note she has a new facial piercing. I ignore it (for now) and affix a look of genuine concern.Okay, Mom, she sniffs dramatically. So I backed into a car at Taco Bell. And then the driver was really mean to mehe yelled! So I left, but I ran over his foot.I raise my eyebrows and start counting the felonies.On the way home, a cop followed me. He pulled me over. I waited until he was out of his carthen I took off!You. took. off.I was scared because I had been drinking her lower lip trembles. And then I hit the sign.What sign?The sign outside our subdivision. The Walnut Grove sign.. You ran the car into a brick wall?Uh-huh, she cries. She buries her face into my chest, wiping her nose on my nightgown like a five year old. The thought of strangling her seems very appealing.Darling, Im going to need you to take a shower and go to bed. When dad gets home, Ill talk to him. Well sort it out. Just go to bed now, all right?Uh-huh, she blubbers. Im sorry, mom, she apologizes, but the apology is insincere. She is sorry she got caught.When she leaves, I lay down on the bedroom floor instead of making up the bed. I gather most of the pillows in a heap and briefly consider making a pillow fort. How nice it would be to have someone else to deal with aging parents and adult children.I sulk, staring at the ceiling., my mother complained one afternoon when I came home from school. I didnt know what she meant and asked her to make me a ham and swiss. I had wondered why she burst into both tears and laughter at my request.Now I know. I am in between two generations whose incessant needs make me wonder who I am.Every woman in her fifties wants to run away, my mother told me before she died. And the ones who dont are few and far between.I think I hate everyone, I confessed to her. Especially men.struation. opause. tal breakdown. You see a trend?We laughed.Running away is easy. Fighting is much harder, she said, lifting my chin, looking into my eyes to see if I was listening. And I didnt raise any wimps.The bedroom door opens, jostles me awake.Honey, why are you on the floor? my husband asks, eyes bloodshot and weary.I stand up and reach my arms around him, grateful for his presence. I was down there getting a new perspective on life.Then youre feeling better? No more hot flashes tonight? No more chills?Oh, theyll be back.Are you sure I cant get you anything for your troubles? he grins, and I wonder how he missed our car decorating the entrance to the neighborhood.Probably a good lawyer or two, I smile, kissing him lightly on the lips."
"Ear, There And Everywhere","Read the story, Daddy! Poppy screamed from her room.Daddy Horse rolled his eyes wishing he could close the chat like on Zoom,Which story is that my love? said Daddy Horse under duress from his wife,Who was standing on one of his hooves and pointing towards his face with a knife,It was late on New Years Eve so Poppy wanted to celebrate in her own way before bed,With the book shed heard her Mum and Dad read cover to cover echoing a million times in her head,The one about the ears, silly! Poppy enthusiastically responded sounding like shed eaten all sugars in the house,Daddy Horse rolled his eyes, grabbed the book from the space behind the sofa that was also being used as a larder by a local mouse,Stomping up the stairs, book in hand, Daddy Horse let out a sigh that lasted the entire flight,Its not that he hated the book, just that hed hoped he could go a day without reading it - maybe even overnight,In fact he wasnt even sure why he had the book as he knew the story off by heart,To say hed read it a thousand times may be an underestimation on his part,Walking into Poppys room Daddy Horse found his daughter sat up in bed ready for the story she loved,He sat down in the armchair ready to try and give it some heart, even if his long face clearly expressed hed had enough,Opening the book to the first page, Daddy Horse cleared his throat and just before he started Poppy interrupted,Remember to do the voices, you know all the ones I like!Yes of course, sweetie Daddy grimaced back tempted to request his kid to get on her bike.Following the rude interruption he revved his throat once more,And could finally start the over familiar story which in his mind wasnt a pleasure but a chore,Why is the wife a maybe, Daddy? asked Poppy unsure of the implication,Maybe it means a girlfriend perhaps? responded Daddy Horse annoyed by his childs complication,I love this part, Daddy! Its when the story gets good!Without speaking, Daddy Horse tried to convey Oh shut up! to his little girl so they were both understood,Do you think Mister Monkey will get Disney Plus, Daddy? Or maybe watch Netflix?Daddy Horse closed his eyes, bit his lip, held his legs to avoid any unexpected kicks,Poppy reached out to her Dad, stroked his arm and whispered Please carry on reading!Daddy Horse relaxed once more and continued to read, relieved his lip wasnt bleeding,Does that mean Santas reindeers are bald, Daddy? Or just have different ears now?Daddy Horse contemplated the query and sadly only mustered a lacklustre response in Possibly ears of a cow?Poppy stared at her father for a moment thinking about his latest level of daft,And then her face fully erupted with the largest heartfelt laugh,Daddy Horse laughed too and took that enthusiasm into the rest of the story,Hoping he could make it through the remaining pages otherwise it could get gory,That doesnt rhyme, Daddy! Poppy pointed out causing Daddy Horses jaw to drop to the floor,How could he explain this one without upsetting his daughter further, giving her a potty mouth and breaking the good parent law?Pausing for a moment he giggled at his daughter before responding with, Oh yeah youre right, thats a bit rubbish!I know, Daddy! said Poppy seriously, how did this book ever get published?Daddy Horse sensing this may be the last time he ever read this story tried to hide his relief,Dived into the final pages with the sheer excitement of a tree sprouting its first leaf,Poppy hugged Daddy Horse with all her might because the book was only part of the enjoyment she got from a bedtime story,Being with her Daddy before her bedtime was a wonderful way to close the day and drift off without a single worry,Daddy Horse smiled and kissed Poppy on the head, settled her back into bed and wished her goodnight,He stomped quietly down the stairs to Mummy Horse who had prepared a table of food to celebrate New Year right.Did she go off okay? asked Mummy Horse knowing how tricky it can be when Poppy is in a mood,Daddy Horse responded with a grin, She drifted off quick and looks like shes finally sick of that book which is really good!Mummy Horse punched the air although she knew the book was compulsory for all kids Poppys age,To get children ready to embrace the annual tradition described in detail on every page,A few hours later the countdown began and Mummy and Daddy Horse took one last look at each other in their current forms,Stroking his sheep ears one last time, as she did the same with her bull ears and horns,The countdown hit zero, they hugged each other for support as their bodies glowed and let out a cheer for all to hear,Happy New Year!"
As Children Do,"Ninety-Seven, Ninety-Eight, Ninety-Nine, ONE HUNDRED. Ready or not! HERE I COME! I spun out of the corner I had smushed my face into. The herringbone parquet flooring glows golden, reflecting the light from the hallway lamps. My Mary-Janes slap against it as I run towards the giant mahogany staircase. I reach the carpet covered stairway and start thundering up them with the abandon of youth and enthusiasm. As I run, the crystal tear drops of the chandelier tinkle as they vibrate and shake from the force of my passage. Mrs McIntosh, the housekeeper always says that me running up the stairs reminds her of how the earth shook under the floor of her first flat every time a train passed. I find that quite odd.Imonly six. Icantmake as much noise as a train. Can I? I slow, dragging my hand, as children do, along the balusters, revelling in the slap, slap sound as my fingersbouncefrom post to carved post.I reach the top of the stairs, pausing. Which way? I wonder as I try and catch my breath. Jack! I call softly, Jack, Im not playing anymore I cry, hoping to trick him. I wait, ears straining. I look at the three hallways branching off the landing. Which way? I tap a finger to my lip like Mum does when she is thinking. The first hallway is in darkness and leads towards Poppas room. He would not be there, not after the last time we were caught there. Ican'tdecide between the hallway leading to the servant stairs or the one leading to the back of the house.Illspin, I decide. I step towards the middle of the landing, close my eyes and spin around and around until I completely lose my balance, as children do. I fall in a heap, giggling to myself. I lay, arms and legs wide, staring up at the ceiling until the giant ceiling rose stops moving.Once I am steady, I push myself up to my elbows, shake my hair out of my eyes, as children do. And look down to see that my Mary -Janes are now pointing me towards the back of the house. I scramble up quickly, decision made. I walk forward, my eyes landing on the pale green wallpaper covered in beautiful emerald peacocks, their trains standing up behind them, Poppa says they can have up to 175 feathers in theirtrains, Icantcount that high yet, but I thinkit'sa lot more than 20. In-between them, are the indigo butterflies, Poppa says, the blue colour comes from peas, but he must be wrong because peas are green. And in amongst the peacocks and butterflies are the golden hummingbirds, Poppa says that they are the only birds that can fly backwards, why would they do that though? The green colour issage,and Poppa says its special Chinese silk that he found in the orient when he was there for the war. Idontknow where the orient is but Mum says people do not call it that anymore and Ishouldnteither.I continuedown the hallway, dragging my fingers along the wallpaper, as children do, loving the tingly feel in my fingertips. I lift my hand from the wall as I reach the large window, I want to climb onto the sill and push myface to the glass, but Mrs Mac made me clean 3 whole windows the last time I did that. I stand and carefully put my hands behind my back. As I look out across the normally green lawn and towards the oak and birch trees, the wind gusts and rain hits the window like water thrown from a bucket. I jump back,alarmed,and give a little shiver, glad to be warm inside Poppas house on such a miserable day. I turn from the window and start moving forward again, trying to count the butterflies on the wall.Lost in my thoughts, I almost forget why I am here and then, my ears prick a little, was that a creak? I know what makes that creak, Im coming Jack! I found you! I yell as down the hallway towards the single flight of wibbly wobbly stairs I go. Of course, Jack ends up where he is not supposed to be, now we will both be in trouble. I mount the stairs and notice the big blue door isnot quite closed. I hesitate for a moment, Mrs Mac told us to stay out of this room today. I bite my lip, what if Jack is in there by himself? What if he breaks something? My heart pounds at the thought, remembering the blown glass horse figurines on the desk and the blue vase as tall as I am, oh no, what if he knocks it over? Fearing the worst, I push the door open quietly, holding my breath and tip toe into the room as children do. The attic is huge, as large as the whole house. One wall is all windows with a lovely wide window seat, perfect for curling up with a good adventure story, which you could easily find on one of the other three walls which are floor to ceiling shelves overflowing with books of every kind.I sneak forward slowly. Jack? I whisper. Hello poppet says a voice that is gravelly and smooth all at the same time.Itscoming from the big red armchair in front of the roaring fireplace. There is a precarious pile of books on one side and a table with two mugs and a plate of biscuits on the other. Hello Poppa, I say. I walk towards the chair. Jack! You traitor! I exclaim as I see that Jack, my faithful hound, mysupposed hideand seek playmate is curled up on Poppas lap enjoying the warmth of the fire. Not hiding at all. Poppa chuckles, Come sit down and tell me about your day, Mrs Mac brought you up a hot chocolate. I flop down on the rug and sigh as children do, wondering how she knew I would end up here? I shrug and reach for a biscuit."
Chase The Aurora,"Well, that was dramatic, Jesus! Simon remarks.As he watches my dog Parker, trip and tumble down the stairs like an out of control avalanche, in excitement to see him, walk through the front door.Oh fantastic your here! Are the others ready?? I ask.Lets go!Yes there all outside, Jennifer dont forget your camera! Simon shouts to me.Okay, Im just looking for my old lenses! God dam it! The mess of which I call my bedroom, has now come back to haunt me!How do I manage to lose everything, in five minutes?!?Ah I found them! I shout with no one left in the house to reply, apart from Parker, whose now quite fearful of the stairs! Your legs werent built for this life, my boy, I add, he smiles as I pat him on the head. I grab my yellow sweaterand start shovelling all my gear into my leather bag, quickly running out the door.Hey! hey! What happened to never leave a man behind?! I shout. Those bloody bastards!Seriously Wait up guys!I follow the noise of the others up ahead, until finally catching up.The full moonlight reflecting of the white snow, certainly helping us navigate through the darkness,this time.Where are we all going, you ask? ...Well, every year in late autumn, we chase the Aurora through the Nordic Sky. Until we reach our favorite camp spot, passing through the local forest to get there.Its about a 5 mile walk from our small town hereIn Sweden, which most of us grew up in. Our families migrated from England, during the logging boom, here in the early eighties, lets just say they needed the money!Its around this part of the trip, especially now that we are much older, that the first sip of our good friend ...whisky, usually comes out.Hey Jennifer, remember that old swing we built, when we were around 7? The rope is still hanging over there, we have to rebuild it one day! Thomas comments, pointing to our left, near an old branch covered in snow.Of course, I remember! You say this every year and every year I agree, but tell me what happens Tom ....?We both look at each other with a smirk.Yeh alright Jen, now shut up and take a drink, your dry mouth sod. The group starts laughing, as he passes me the flask.Sophie quickly turns to the group, guys be quiet! Can you here that??I think we have company tonight, and with a evil smile, she turns around and marches ahead.You mean the wolves? Good, Im glad!Maybe they like whiskey and smores and perhaps we can ride them home tomorrow, when we all hungover, on deaths door. Save the walk? I add.Now youre talking Jen,But I think Id rather to ride a bear, i prefer comfort over speed, Corey adds.Still doesnt explain your right awful haircut, though does it Corey? Did your mum want you to look like a twat, or was that specifically what you were going for??You look like Fredrick who owns the rug shop intown and we all know, a man with that many rugs... is hiding something!  Thomas replies.Okay, okay, I get it guys, just leave poor Frederick out of it. You know he hasnt been the same since his wife left! Corey replies.Did she leave or disappear? Thomas questionsYeh someone better check under those rugs! Sophie remarksHaha ok enough with the conspiracies, anyway I think my mother did a cracking job, with my hair. At least she didnt cut my ears off, besides Its lockdown guys, who have I got to impress?. Ive got more chance with a muskrat, then any girls in this bloody town!. Corey adds and he was right. He hadnt had much luck with the women for a while and it was mating season for the muskrat.Finally, we arrive at the clearing of our campsite.Thank god! I thankfully drop all my heavy gear onto the ground and stretch my arms.I swear Jen, like mother like daughter, every time I see your mum in town, shes carrying around 10 bags on each arm, like shes marry bloody Poppins and your worse!Thanks Sophie, what can I say my families been carrying this town for generations! Now lets grab some wood for the fire, before you complain about the cold again.We both race off, to find something we can burn, in between the distant howls and echoes of the wind that chase through trees.As we sit around the newly built fire, we start to sing a few drunken tunes, from our childhood. Cleary part of our ridiculously ongoing tradition!Three cheers to winter,What feels like a splinter,Lord knows it might kill ya,So pour me a drink!And if i die hastily,From pork rum and pastry,The heavens shall chase me,So pour meeeeeADrinkkkkk!!!!We all shout.Almost falling into the fire as will spill our baileys and whiskey with laughter.Sophie, Sophie please tell me you brought your camera!? I think we need a group photo, before we cant stand anymore ha-ha. Thomas joyfully shouts.I didnt, but Jen did!She also brought her whole house with her if you want anything? Sophie jokes. Oh, how I missed you all I sarcastically replyI second that Jen Corey addsJust Make sure you get the tripod so you can be in the photo, because as much as Id love a cheap looking selfie with the bears, that may or may not be watching us right now... i think we could use your photography skills on this one!Plus, we can send it to max, who bailed on us today, you know, rub it in a bit!Yeh that little grub, hell regret this! To busy with his new friends, I guess. Thomas remarks while overcooking his marshmallow.Ah bollocks! Hell never replace us, I mean look at us! Sophie mumbles, while attempting to poor wine, into a nonexistent glass.Brilliant alright, let me get my legs under me, for a second, Ill grab the camera!  I say, stumbling over to my backpack, to grab the camera gear.Okay guys, we are good to go for the photo! Now, I have it set on a timer...so we have ten seconds! I shout.We all squeeze up against each other, pulling hideous faces to attempt to appear half sober. Okay everyone in 3, 2, 1 (Flash)"
The Nativity Goat,"The small black goat looked out into the immense auditorium and sighed.The cavernous space was devoid of an audience, each of the 600 upholstered maroon seats stared back at him with taunting flat faces.		Jaxon Jesse Simpson! Screeched the teacher.Literally.She was a puffy, square-shaped screech owl with chestnut tufts for ears, and round golden eyes the size of saucers behind her wire framed glasses.		Jaxon jumped and glowered at her.His scruffy eyebrows pulled into hoods over his eyes.The three kittens playing angels giggled.Mazie, the calf, rolled her eyes at Rollie, the donkey.He brayed soft laughter in return.		Mrs.Pollimer tapped her cane on the polished oak stage.  The sound echoed out into the cold, dark theatre.She said, Please pay attention!		Why? He asked sulkily, his voice small, from the back row of animals. He added, I dont even have any lines.His head hung low, the ends of his red woolen scarf dusted the floor.		This is a group effort, young goat.It is tradition that all the class play a part.		Why cant I be a wise man? Jaxon implored, lifting his dark eyes to the opossum, raccoon and badger cast in those parts.Jerry the possum stuck his tongue out at the little black goat who then added, Im wiser than they are.		Now the entire class guffawed.		Hush now!Quiet down! Screeched the screech owl.Time for one more rehearsal!In your places please!		Jaxons ears echoed with the sound of paws and hooves trotting and tapping and clodding on the wooden stage as he crept behind the backdrop scenery and heavy curtain beyond.If anyone noticed his absence, they remained in relieved silence of it.		Jaxon stepped out one of the double backstage doors and into an icy grey world, swirling with white, it was as if hed stepped into a snow-globe.He picked up his pace, his scarf a whipping flag before him, and bounded into the safety of the cedar trees bunched at the far end of the school property.He shivered icy flakes from his coat and leapt deeper into the woods.		The small black goat didnt want to go home to the orphanage. He felt alone amongst his peers and today, had never felt so unloved, so useless, so small.				After an hour he realized that not only had he never ventured this far into the dark, shadowy forest, but he was entering the forbidden acres.The wind whipped bare branches into his face, he squinted to protect his eyes. Snowy gales played hide-and-seek with him from between the immense pines.They always found him, stabbing at his soft belly with icicle fingers, 		He rounded a bend and a flurry of immense black birds  into the charcoal grey sky.The whole world was a baroque black and white movie of harsh contrasts and menacing premonitions.He thought, suddenly nervousThe worst thing about ravens is that where they lurk, death does too.		The birds flew to the tree tops high above him and screeched curses at him in an ancient language he did not understand. He lay on his belly on the frozen white earth, and covered his head with his hooves, expecting to feel razor sharp talons slicing into his fur any second.		A blue jay swooped suddenly from a patch of inky-black cedar shadows, it's feathers a welcome splash of brilliant azure in the monochromatic clearing.It cawed as it circled above him.As he watched, bolts of brilliant yellow lightening flew from the birds head, aimed towards the ravens in the trees.All but one raven flew into the sky, like graceful, distinguished Draculas.		The jay flew into the tree opposite the remaining raven. A tiny figure popped up from around the far side of its neck, it looked like charred kindling pulled from a hearth, bound together by wire, and wrapped in black rags.A tiny, pointed hat sported tiny, pointed ears.As Jaxon watched in wonder and horror, the evil creatures eyes flashed blue sparks and a nearly white fire ball, tinged in blue, flew from its outstretched twiggy hands.		It nailed the jay birds wing!The jay tumbled head over heels, to the ground; a splash of blue feathers drifted in its wake.Before hitting the ground, a tiny figure leapt from the birds back.		The wee elf tucked into a ball and rolled somersaults atop the snowy ground.It came to a stop in front of Jaxons nose, spraying the goats astonished face with fine, icy flakes.The enchanting elf bounced to her feet and looked around for her bird.In forest green tights and pointy brown booties, she was a blur of green as she raced to her feathered companion, she skidded to a halt at its chest.Her pretty, pale face all but disappeared in soft blue feathers as she listened for a heartbeat.		Jaxon said quietly, is he dead?		The wee she elf spun towards the voice as if shed forgotten he was there.He was used to that.		She said, No,  heart beats.		The goat and elf looked up into the treetops.The evil black duo was gone.		Jaxon fired off questions, what was that?Youre an elf, arent you?Where are we?		The pretty little elf put her mittened hands on her hips.She wore a silky, long-sleeved tunic, emerald-green, with bronze colored embroidery, a yellow scarf and belt.Ash blond hair spiked out from her acorn helmet.She  and removed the nutshell from her head, her hair spilled in messy cornsilk waves down her back to her knees.As she neared the young goat, he saw that her enormous eyes were chocolate brown with gold and amber flecks.She looked like one of those old 1970s paintings of waifs with ginormous eyes.		She said, Yes, Im an elfduh.That was a Nordicbalphi, a Nordif for short.She added cryptically, We are not far from my home, though I fear I have no way to get there.I wont leave Blue-Berry Twinkle-Toes. She looked sadly at the jay, tears magnified her mysterious dark eyes.One escaped, it slid down her rosy cheeks, and dropped from her pointy chin.When it hit the snow, a tiny spray of golden glitter .		A flurry of fluttering wingbeats filled the clearing, a flurry of snowflakes drifted to the ground.		Cardinals, goldfinches, chickadees, robins, and more alit on low lying branches, each carrying a wee elf dressed in similar outfits- tunics and tights, scarves and mittens- in a plethora of mainly green shades.		The elf next to Jaxon said, This is my family.Im Astra-Senika by the way		Im Jaxon.I can help you get home		Itll be dangerous.The Nordif are out in full force.We are losing the battle against them.I fear we may lose not only our home, but our entire race.		I have no family.I have nothing to lose.Let me help you.		Astra looked into Jaxons sad, nearly black eyes for a few seconds then nodded.What a shame.You have such a good heart, young goat.		She called to her clan who waited silently in the trees.This is Jaxon Jesse Simpson		Jaxon goggled at her. 		She continued, he is going to help me home.		The elves in the trees, mounted on songbirds, chattered amongst themselves.At last, the oldest, with snow white hair and a knee length, double-braided beard, called down, very well, daughter.We will escort you from above, lest the demon Nordifs return.		One by one, each bird-mounted elf dropped long, colorful filaments to the ground.Orange, yellow, red and purple silk-like threads floated down gracefully.Astra gathered them up quickly and tied them all together in one, ten-foot-long cord.				She whispered into Berrys ear.The birds head lifted wearily.She rose shakily to her feet and cried out as her broken wing dropped to the ground.		One of the goldfinches came down and silently landed by the jay like a fluffy, lemony yellow pompom with legs and small, pointy beak.A thin elf with honey colored hair, wearing moss green tunic and tights, leapt like a ballet dancer, from the pretty birds back.Astra and the male elf, Branon, secured the poor blue jays wing to her side.Then, with Astra on one side of Jaxon, and Branon, on the other, they lifted the blue jay onto Jaxons shoulders and secured the bird with the remainder of the silken cord.		Brannon gave a little salute to the loaded-up goat and leapt upon his finchs back.		Four miles into the woods, the sky grew dark. 		Astra lifted her tiny mittened hands to the sky.The clouds parted, revealing the brilliant white orb of a moon.Astras hands filled with moonlight. The magical lantern was small but bright.High above them, two dozen more tiny lanterns glowed, and the sky was filled with flying stars.		The trees were getting sparser, and the icy, frozen ground inclined upwards at sharper and sharper an angle. Astra told the sure-footed goat stories of their enemy, the Nordif, as they ascended the mountain.They were an ancient race of elves from the deepest bowels of Norway hills, displaced by ore mining humans.They sought to take over Astras race of Kindweenots. Their leader, Drookin, sought ultimate power through the death of Astra, the most powerful, magic elf their world had ever seen.He intended to enslave them and use their magic for his own elevation to a God-like status.He would drain them of their powers- their life-force- then toss the husks away like garbage.And he dreamed of taking revenge up the human race.		We live at the top of this mountain, inside it.When the Nordifs discover this, we will be doomed 		Just then, the entire mountain quaked.The earth under Jaxons small hooves reverberated with thunder, his feet did a scary little skittering dance, his back legs slipped over the steep edgebut only for a few seconds.After the shock wore off, he found his feet and continued up the steep slope with fierce determination.		The elves in the air chattered excitedly, in alarm.				Suddenly, the air around Jaxon and Astra was filled with huge, flapping black flags!		The ravens swooped and swirled, cutting Astra and Jaxon off from the rest of their clan.Over Jaxons head, Astra fired a white-hot fireball from her palms.She nailed a ravens wing and it screamed in fury as it fella thousand feet below.Two more ravens fell past them, haven taken shots from overhead.Then a soft, greyish-brown wren fell past, fluttering a single wing uselessly.Astra pulled the bird and rider in on a strand of silken rope like a fisherman reeling in a trout.They clung to the cords around Jaxons shoulders.		A raven, the largest by nearly twice the size of the others, circled Jaxons group. 						Astra yelled, Drookin! Faster! Faster Jaxon!		Drookin sent a whitish blue bolt of lightning at a cardinal that swooped down close.She yelled, No! And shot a yellow-tailed bolt that intercepted the blue one.They burst together in a retina-scorching display of fireworks.As soon as Astra had let go of the last bolt, Drookin had one aimed at her.She was too late to deflect it.It knocked her flat against Jaxons neck. 		He felt hot, burning, embers and smelled singed fur.He called out, Astra!				He got no answer from her.The elf they had rescued sobbed and said into Jaxons left ear, Shes dead! 				A flurry of fire balls erupted angrily over their heads and three more ravens fell head over heels past them, black feathers swirled in the gale winds. Their strapped-on stick-figure demon riders, either flopped limply, like knobby bags of bonesor they flayed futilely to get free.		The elves disappeared over the tip top of the mountain.Jaxon struggled to follow them to their world.The snow was a storm at the apex, it all but blinded the relentless goat 		There! cried the elf on his back. Jaxon forced himself still.His legs trembled with the urgency to keep going, down the other side.		He strained to see what the elf was pointing to.Jaxon wondered if hed fit.		As if reading his mind, the elf yelled over the shrieking wind, Its wider than it looks!The entire length is covered by ice and snow!		Jaxon nodded, and with renewed strength made his way quickly down the steep slope, sliding and scrabbling for footholds the whole way.		The giant raven screeched in his right ear!He jumped, losing his footing for a few seconds.Hold on hold on! Screamed the elf from his neck, almost there!		Jaxon was close enough to see half a dozen tiny green clad arms waving them on like grass stalks bristling in the wind.		The raven swooped and hovered directly in front of Jaxons face, blocking his advance.		Then  A bluey-white fireball, sizzling with electricity, came straight at him!It flashed between his eyes and hurt like nothing hed felt before.He was blind!He made his feet move, but they galloped in nothing but thin air!		The raven screeched in pain and anger, its harsh voice disappeared downwardshe heard the feathers rustling, heading down.		The elf on his back said, Astras spelled you.After you were hit, the fireball rebounded at the bird!Double strength!Whoo-hoo!				He slammed into a snowy ledge and tried scabbling onto it.He managed to stand into a crouch but, still being blind and discombobulated, took a step in the wrong direction. He felt himself tumbling down into blood-freezing, empty space. The wee being screamed so high-pitchedly in his ear, it was nearly soundless, like a dog whistle.		In silent blackness his consciousness left him.		Gradually, the edges of his vision brightened to greythen came on full force.He looked down and saw white and green and patches of brown streaking past, far below!His small, shiny black hooves were gallopingin thin air! The ground at least twelve hundred feet below!  He thought, 		He looked up and screamed! Hed nearly flown right into the mountain that he recognized as the home of the elves.The elf on his back joined his scream and pulled up on the cords as if they were reigns.The jay cawed and the wren squeaked a cry.Jaxon flew vertically up another four hundred feet to the mountain top, as if pulled up like a kite on the wind.				The sky was clearing, the top was level with the few remaining wispy clouds.They breezed away into the starry, black night.The crevasse was easy to spot.A lantern was burning warm, welcoming sunny light.As Jaxon and his riders approached the entrance, two elf sentries in green and gold waved frantically and laughed and cheered.		As Jaxon landed at the cavern mouth, two dozen more elves had appeared.They quickly untied the birds and Astras lifeless body and whisked them away inside.Jaxon squeezed through the narrow opening and followed the elves down deep into the bowels of the mountain. It was warm and cozy, with high, vaulted ceilings of natural granite.Hundreds of tiny moonlight lanterns lit up the vast space.The walls and ceiling sparkled magically with mica that caught the lantern light. 		An old elf woman, the elders wife, brought the worn-out goat a warm drink of herbs and cinnamon.In minutes he was asleep.***The next morning, he awoke in a large, toasty-warm room with rows of beds like a hospital.He was amused to see the elves had put four of their largest beds together for him, yet his hooves still hung over the end.		Next to him was the jay bird, her wing bandaged against her body.He turned over and saw Astra, fast asleep in the next bed.She was breathing and alive, though bandages covered her arms, and her face was reddened as if sunburnt. Branon sat at her side and held her hand.He turned around to Jaxon and said, shell be fine in a week or so		Thank goodness!So, it wasnt a dream then?I really flew?		My heavens yes!No!I mean yes, you can fly!And no, you werent dreaming! He laughed in delight at the goats wondering, elated expression.He said, Astra spelled you so you could save us all!		But I fellI nearly killed us all		Without you, Astra would be no longer and the Nordifs would either enslave us or slaughter us.She is still only a child- our savior- her powers will grow as she matures.		Like the baby JesusJaxon said under his breath.Louder, he said, Ive got to go!Im needed at home!		The elder elves and a few of the others had joined Branon.The eldest with the long white beard said, Yes, you must go now.The flying spell wont last much longer, though long enough to see you home.***On the stage of the school auditorium, Jaxon Jesse Simpson looked out at the audience.Every seat was filled, and every face glowed with Christmas cheer.		He proudly stood in the back row of animals, in between a white pygmy goat smaller than he, and a pretty little chestnut filly, excitedly hopping from hoof to hoof.He looked at the three wise men, the opossum in the center looked up and winked at him, smiling.		As the entire cast sang Silent Night together, Jaxons voice joined in. He felt in perfect harmony for the first time ever.He saw at the very back of the theatre, in the ebony darkness, two hundred tiny yellowy white sparks, wavering to and fro along with the song that filled the air."
The Christmas Hat,"Miss Smithereen, as excited as her class, stood in front of the chalkboard. The short, spiney quills down her back poked through the soft red wool of her most Christmassy dress.She stamped her tiny hedgehog feet, shod in sensible black penny loafers, and clapped her tiny hedgehog paws together for attention.She pushed her eyeglasses up her pointy black nose and said, Now class, we still have an hour before the bellThe class of woodland animals groaned in unison.Eddie, an outspoken raccoon child, looked around at his classmates. Every whisker quivered, the room was infused with the elated electricity that only Christmas brings.He looked back at Miss Smithereen and noted the mischievous smile on her frosty, furry face.It was her tradition to let the class out early on the last day before Christmas vacation.  He wondered.The old hedgehog slowly walked to the door.She opened it and stepped aside, announcing, Off you go!Merry Christmas!Twenty-two, high pitched voices nearly brought down the roof with their cheers.The windows rattled in their panes like applause.As the class ran out the door, Miss Smithereen called out, See you all in a week!Eddie shrugged into the warm winter sweater his gramma had made the year before. It was oatmeal colored, with a red zig zag pattern along the hem.He wore a red tasseled cap with matching mittens.He met up with Julian, a sleek-coated red weasel in a brown puffer jacket and wool cap with ear flaps, and Harley, a chipmunk wrapped nearly head to toe in a green woolen muffler and matching toque.Harley made up for his small size with a great lion-hearted personality.Eddie said, I think Im getting some new Hot Wheels this year for my collection.Im hoping for a beebee gun! Exclaimed Julian.I asked for a complete set of Dickens books. Said Harley.Thats so nerdy. Laughed Eddie.Shoulda asked for elevator shoes.Ha. Ha.Harley said as he punched Eddie in the arm.I cant change being the smallest animal in the woods, but I can strive to be the smartest.Right on! Exclaimed his friends, both giving him a high five. The three bundled upanimals bounced along the snowy lane through the northern Montana forest.	Woodsmoke slipped upwards, through the crisp, piney scented air.As they neared Eddies home, the pleasant wintry air was sweetened by the smell of hot cocoa and fresh ginger snaps.The boys ran the rest of the way to the cozy, hillside burrow.Oh boy!Said Eddie as he ran ahead of his buddies.Harley tried to run as well but tripped on his scarf.He got to his knees, gathered some snow in his paws and hurled a marble-sized ball at Eddies head.It erupted on impact into a flurry of icy white crystals that glittered to the ground.Eddie said, Oh yeah?He molded a huge round snowball and chucked it at Harley.Since it was nearly half the size of the chipmunk, it bowled him over, and rolled with the chipmunk, picking up more snow.Harley became one big white ball with paws, feet, and the toques pom-pom sticking out.Eddie Buttons!Go help your little friend up!Then come inside for cocoa and cookies!His mother, Alice, stood in the open doorway.Julian took a shot at Eddie, his snowball nailed him in the ear, then Harley nailed Julian right between his ears.All three child animals shook snow from their fur and, laughing, went inside.***On Christmas Eve, early in the morning, while mom, pop, and son were eating pancakes, a thump shook the front door of the raccoons home.Eddie ran to the door and flung it open in time to see their mail-badger trudging through a foot of fresh snow back to his little USPS mail wagon.Thanks Mr.Poppinstuff!The tired old badger in the navy-blue uniform didnt turn around but lifted a weary, mittened hand in acknowledgement.The matching hat with the eagle logo and faux fur ear flaps was pulled snugly over his grey furred head.His shoulders slumped and white breath-puffs like cotton balls drifted over his head.Eddie looked down at his feet at the parcel the mail-badger had left.The parcel was wrapped in shiny red and gold foil was as tall as his shoulders when he stood it on end.The name on the box was his- oh boy! He squealed in delight.Alice asked, What is it dear?Something for me.Look.He turned the box so she could see it.She frowned and looked at Will, her husband.He slowly shook his head and shrugged.The address was theirs: 831 Maple Lane, Mulebottom, MO. The return address said only, From Santa.Can I open it?Its only Christmas Eve son.Said Will, a smile curled his mouth and twinkled in his eyes.Awe Pops.You always let me open one the day before.What do you think Momma?Let the kid open one early?Eddies mother smiled and said to her husband, he has been good this yearAnd I got three As last report card!And two Bs!Will drew out the suspense another minute as Eddie bounced from foot to foot like a kid who has to pee- badly.At last, he said, Go on, open it.Im as curious as you are.Eddie said, Uh huh. Sarcastically.Every year his folks threw in a gift theyd labelled as From Santa even though they knew he didnt believe in Santa Claus at the ripe old age of eleven.He sliced the colorful wrapping paper with a sharp claw. It crinkled tumultuously as he pulled it off the white box inside. He opened the flaps.Woah. He said and looked at both his parents.They were frowning and smiling uncertainly, like at any second it might start raining turnip pies.The note atop a pile of snow-white tissue paper read, Made especially for you at Christmas.He pulled the thin paper asidethen frowned.Whaaa---?Gingerly he poked the thing in the box.Then he screamed and backed away so quickly that he tripped over his tail, fell on his butt, and scrabbled like a crab across the room.His ear-blasting scream frightened his parents, both their fur stood on end, so bloodcurdling was the sound.His mother, Alice, dashed forward and looked in the box.Her eyes turned to huge round planets as Will bent over the box.He reached into it and pulled outa dead body?It was a hat.A raccoon skin hat to be exact.As the tail flopped out like a thick, striped bristle brush, all three raccoons screamed.Will dropped it back into the box and kicked it across the wood floor.Whats it mean Pop?Is it reallyreally the rest came out in a whisper, a dead body?Well, said Will, its actually just the skin and peltand tail of a raccoon.Oh my. Said Alice. do you think it is?Who would  this?I dont recognize him.And with no return address, it could be from anywhere.It had my name and our address on it.Its from a serial killer.Said Eddie with certainty.Will and Alice looked at their son.Neither said anything.Perhaps it was a serial killer playing with them.The thing in the box was utterly ghastly.What else could it be?Will locked the front door, then the back door in the kitchen too.He shuttered the windows and latched them tight.Alice silently washed the after-breakfast dishes while Will paced the living room floor while waiting for the police.Within ten minutes, sirens wailed, and red flashing lights reflected off the snowy hillocks and tree trunks and branches, doubling their intensity into a discotheque type scene.In front of the burrow, the forest green sheriffs car slid to a stop.The Sheriff, a silvery grey fox, and a Deputy skunk came to the door.After taking the body away and interviewing the shaken-up family, they left.Eddie said, Do you think theyll catch the killer?Alice said, They have little to go on.They cant autopsy on a skin.Will added, And death is an everyday occurrence in our animal world.But this is torture!Its a cruel taunt that screams, Eddie wailed.Animals kill for food, they dont  with their food.Well, there was that cousin of yoursthe cross-eyed one from your dads side---Mom!Seriously? He played tiddlywinks with his crawdads.This is different.She sighed and wrung her stubby little fingers together.Eddie picked up the phone and called Julians number.He talked for only a minute, then put down the receiver.With a long face he said, Julians parents wont let him come overWill said, You cant really blame them.You can go over there if you like.No, Eddie said softly, Hes not allowed to hang out with me at all.Oh Honey, said Alice, Im sorry.Eddie tried Harleys number next.And got the same result.Harleys father had practically hung up on him.Eddie said with a small, wavering voice, This is the worst Christmas ever.He seemed so small right then, not eleven, but merely three years old.Christmas isnt until tomorrow.We have a feast to prepare, presents to open, songs to sing, and plenty of football on tv.His dad said, trying to sound upbeat.Eddie nodded gloomily and said, Ill be in my room.I dont feel so well.***An hour later, Alice went to her sons room, a steaming mug of hot cocoa in hand, a pile of marshmallows melting into a merry, goopy treat.She knocked softly on the door and said, Eddie honey, Ive made you some cocoa, just the way you like itWhen she got no answer, she opened the door.The room was empty.***Eddie ran down the path through the woods.It was growing dark, the snowy landscape bluely glowed, and black shadows grew larger and taller.He stopped often and looked around in every direction.He felt eyes on him.Malicious ones, hidden in shadows.Sticking out his red wool cap, his ears perked up like radar dishes, revolving this way and that, alert for the minutest of sounds.A branch snapped to his left, but he saw nothing there.He turned back to the path andAAAAAAaaaaa!!! Right in front of him!It was Harley, bundled in a black muffler and matching toque.Hi Eddie!You scared the snot outta me!Whatre you doing out here?Coming to help you, bro.I snuck out.Julian wanted to come but his dad put locks on all their windows.This could be dangerous.I think Im being followed.Harley looked around.Only his beady little onyx eyes peered from his warm winter get-up.Your ma made you another set, eh?Harley nodded, She always makes the scarf too long, she thinks it makes me look bigger.It does. Fatter.Thanks.Harley whispered harshly, panicky, Did you hear---Shhhh!I told you! Eddie hissed, then he whispered, Ive got to find that old mail-badger and find out where the box came from.The mail wagons on the other side of these woods. Harley said.Lets get out of here. Said Eddie.He started running.Harley started runningand tripped over the long scarf.He wrapped up the loose end and tied it tight.He ran after Eddie and caught up quickly- chipmunks are lightning fastraccoons, not so much.The black velvet curtain of sky fell and lights from the town blinked to life.There were just a few stars and a bright bold moon peeking out from between the low-lying charcoal clouds As they neared the edge of the forest, an enormous black shadow undulated over the sparkling, luminescent snow in front of them.They stumble-skidded to a stop.Eddie dove under a snowbank, pulling the chipmunk with him.They held their breath as the colossal shadow passed by them.It was as big as a Transformer Robot!After ten minutes, Harley peaked out from the snow.Look. He whispered and pointed to a boxy white truck with a red and blue eagle logo on the side.The engine was idling, plumes of silvery exhaust wafted over them.Eddie said, Thats why the killer didnt smell us, were downwind. They got out of the freezing snow and shook it off.Mr.Poppinstuff emerged from the truck, he clomped onto the snow covered road.His foot slipped and he caught the doorframe to catch his balance.He cursed under his breath.Sounds like my dad, said Harley.As they watched, the stooped, old grey badger in the blue uniform rolled the back gate up a third, reached inside, and wrangled a heavy looking package out.It slipped through his mittened hands and dropped to the ground.Mr.Poppinstuff hopped on one foot a few times, cursing fresh utterances.He bent and retrieved the misbehaving package, then walked to the door of the last home at the edge of the woods.Hot, meaty breath bellowed across their backs!Without turning, they ran for mail truck.Footsteps pounded behind them!A paw half the size of Eddies whole body swiped at his sweater, shredding the soft, thick wool.Yikes! He squealed.Harley made it to the truck.He heard the cry and raced back to his friend.He unwound the long scarf and with it, ran circles in a Flash Gordon blur around the legs of the cougar.The cougar roared furiously, tottered on its tied together tip toes, and fell forward like fresh hewn timber. Eddie and Harley ran to the mail truck and dove through the narrow opening.The cougars paws whirred in a Tasmanian devil frenzy, the scarf was shredded in seconds.It bounded after its prey.At the mail truck, it swiped its monstrous paw through the opening.Eddie and Harley screamed.In the empty, boxy truck, the caterwauling vibrated the metal walls, and reverberated around them as if the little white truck had swallowed them alive.The huge paw receded out the rolldown door like a snake whipping back after a strike.The boys looked at each other, shaking, eyes wide, the echoes of their screams faded, and silence ensued.Wait! Not quite silentA low, deep rumbling sound came to their ears.Curious, the raccoon and wee chipmunk dared to peek out the mail-truck door.The killer cougar had backed up twenty feet.It wasnt looking at the boys hidey hole, it was looking atMr.Poppinstuff!Only it wasnt Mr.Poppinstuff any longer.The old mail-badger had transformed into a super-hero!He stood up straight on his hind legs and was nearly as tall as the confused cat.The badger hissed like a demon from hell and both boys would swear his eyes glowed crimson red like ominous, firey embers.The cougar took a swipe at the demon badger.The boys heard the swish and gasped.The badger screeched liked a banshee as he dodged the blow like a prize fighter.A champion one.The badger demons front paws whirred in the space between the two battlers and threatened to buzz the cats nose off like a chainsaw.The cat backed up, roared, and swiped an enormous paw low.He sent the badger tumbling backwards. And immediately pounced at the advantage.It pinned the badger down and would soon tear out his throat.Eddie leapt from the mail truck and onto the huge cats head.As he futilely punched the head, he screamed at the cat, YOU sent me that package! I know it!Youre a killer with a demented mind!Youve been stalking me ever since! What is  with you?!The cat covered its vulnerable eyes with its paws and said, What are you  about?!Eddie screamed, The body!The hat!The skin of one of my kin!The badger was standing again, red sparks flew from its eyes, its spittle flew like acid rain, it raised its arms with shiny, sharp black claws curled.As it lunged, the cat threw the raccoon off as if it were a rag doll.It shouted, You all cray-cray! And disappeared into the woods.Mr.Poppinstuff was back in uniform, hat, and mittens.The boys, however, would never be able to see him as anything but a superhero.He said to Eddie, Whats all this about a serial killer?Eddie explained his terrifying morning.The mail-badger nodded with a finger aside his nosethinking.At last, he said, It was me---Whaaa---?! Said the boys as they backed away with shocked, frightened faces.Mr.Poppinstuff waved his mittens and said, No, no, no!Thats not what I meant.I mean it is my fault for your terrifying morning.I misdelivered the package.It should have gone to the Eddie that lives at 831 Maple Way.Hes a grizzly bear.The boys stood like statues and gawped.Then they all laughed.Mr.Poppinstuff said, Well, I guess Im not done for the night after all.Would you care to accompany me?The boys were so relieved, and enamored with the old guy, they said sure.Mr.Poppinstuff said, Hop in!They did.The badger whistled.Two snow-white reindeer bounded out from the woods.From behind the passengers seat the boys shared, the badger pulled out a harness, complete with jingly jangly jingle bells.In minutes, they were soaring over the white, sparkling land.They headed north.The ground was a blur with very few lights, soon, no lights at all.They flew so fast, stars looked like comets.At the North Pole they met Santa Claus.He gave the mail-badger an identical package to Eddies mistakenly delivered gift and another, smaller one with his name and address on it.Correct and complete and sure this time."
'Tis The Season For Believin,"""Uncle Mike?"" Jake said while looking up from his soggy Cheerios.    Michael Remer peaked over the morning paper at his nephew. ""Yeah kid?""""What does  mean?"" he asked, balancing a spoonful of milk in mid-air. ""Where did you hear that word?"" the tone of his question didn't match the chuckle he covered with his knuckles.   ""I heard mommy say that to daddy,"" he said, retreating back to his cereal. ""It's a bad word. Isn't it?"" 	Mike's smirk turned to a frown as he closed the paper and laid it on the table. Removing his reading glasses, he exhaled through his nostrils while struggling to find a suitable explanation for a seven year-old.	Look, Jake..."" Mike rubbed the stubble on his chin before continuing, ""Sometimes grown-ups say things they don't meanwhen they're angry.""	The comforting whiffed as his nephew remained submerged in the mini whirlpools he spun in his milk. The innocent child playing with his cereal made his stomach flip. He had to cheer him up. 	Using the wisdom of his additional twenty years of life experience, he dodged the subject by changing it to something universally loved by all children. ""But, Christmas is in a week! did you already send in your list to Santa?"" 	""Luke Allen in my class says Santa isn't real."" Jake said to his bowl. 		""First off, don't ever trust someone with two first names,"" the joke landed as Jake's head emerged from the cereal with a smile. 		""Secondly, if that were true, where do all the presents come from?"" 	""He says they come from mommies and daddies."" 	""Hogwash!"" he snapped. ""There'll be no such lies in this house,!"" he added with an over the top pirate accent (a homage to Jake's fascination with the thieves of the sea). 	Mike's goofy shouting caused the boy to snort with laughter. The wonder that exists in the hearts of every young child, returning to his face. ""Now, finish  breakfastor  be walkin' the plank! ! !"" he said while scooping the paper back up and noticing the sports section. ""And y be joinin' the Red Sox, apparently"" he added with mild dissatisfaction and a raised eyebrow. Jake giggled, returning the spoon to milk with a scoop that overshadowed his mouth.  	After returning home from dropping off Jake at school, Mike called to check-in with his brother. 	""How'd it go? he wasn't too much trouble was he?"" Richard Remer asked. 	""He never is, Rick."" Mike said. 	""Good. Sorry to just drop that on you but we had to figure some stuff out. Stuff that couldn't wait."" 	Rick was that kind of guy. Everything was on his schedule and everyone else just had to work around it. . 	""Yeah, how's it all going?"" 	""Not great,"" Rick said through an exaggerated sigh. ""But, we're trying to work through it. You know, for Jake and all."" 	""That's noble. And now that you mention itI know it's not my place, but Jake told me this morning he overheard a fight. He said he heard Erin call you a"" 	""You're right! it's not your place,"" Rick interrupted. 	Mike could feel the heat coming through the receiver as he went on.	""What happens with  family is  business, got that?""	""Understood."" Mike said, choosing the one word answer over the more attractive spewing of hot truths that boiled in his gut. 	""I know this hasn't been easy on him,"" Rick started to backpedal his emotions. ""I remember how hard it was on us."" 	 	""On top of everything, he's getting bullied at school now"" 	""Wait, he's getting picked on?"" Mike's anger towards his brother morphed in a different direction upon hearing the news. 	""Yeah, some kid starting teasing him about believing in Santa and what not. Got a few of the other kids to join in."" 	""Luke Allen?"" he spoke from seethed lips as he envisioned taking a trip to the Allen home and having a few choice words for Luke's parents. 	""Did Jake mention it?"" Rick asked. 	""Yeah, he sure did. I hope you gave that kid's parents a piece of your mind!"" 	""Settle down. They're just boys. This stuff happens. Besides, it's probably time he learned the truth anyways."" Rick said. 	""He's seven, Rick."" 	""That's about the age I found out."" 	""Yeah and look how  turned out."" Mike immediately regretted the blurted out words. 	""And what's that supposed to mean!"" Rick's temperature was rising again. 	""I'm sorry, I didn't mean. Igot a little worked up. I just don't think it's the right time to crush his"" 	""Mike!"" Rick yelled above his younger brother. 	""Fine, you're right. Your family, your call."" Mike backed off. 	""Good! sheesh, man. One day, you'll understand what it's like to be a father. Gotta make tough decisions."" 	Mike always hated his older brother's condescending lectures and this one was no different. Using the same technique that worked on his son earlier, he recycled the topic switcheroo method and said, ""Well, I'm still quite a few chapters away from getting to that one."" 	Rick belted a pack-a-day smoker's raspy laugh as he added, ""Yeah, you can't put the cart before the horse!"" 	Mike tried to echo the expression but it came out flat and phony; Rick didn't seem to notice. Mike's love life was a long-running joke between the two of them (with one side enjoying the humor more than the other). 	""But, in all seriousness,"" Rick paused to clear his throat with two coughs, before continuing, ""how's it goin' in the lady department? any prospects?"" 	""Nah, work is so crazy right now. I can't even make time to watch a ball game, let alone try to date someone."" 	""Maybe you should ask Santa for one!"" Rick barely got the sentence out before unleashing another obnoxious wheezing howl. 	""Ha, good one! But, I already wasted my wish this year on a cherry red Ferrari!"" Mike now joined his brother in laughter and this time it was genuine. 	The doorbell in the distance lowered Mike's chuckles. With Rick still making a racket on the other end, his ear drifted from the phone. Tilting his head for improved listening, he waited for the reverberating ring to evaporate. Satisfied with the appropriate amount of silence, he started to turn back to the conversation.	 He sprung up from the kitchen table. 	""Hey, Rick,"" he paused, waiting for his brother to die down. When it didn't, he interjected again but louder, ""Rick!"" 	""Yeah?"" his roaring, having melted into the response. 	""Someone's at my door. I'll have to call you back."" 	Having ended the call, he trotted down the stairs of his split-level home. As he reached the last step  	""I'm comin'!"" he yelled as he yanked at the handle, swinging the door open. ""What's so damn import"" 	The porch was deserted.  The only thing greeting him at the screen door window was the beginning of light flurries (which the weatherman on the radio this morning had assured wouldn't come until later this afternoon).  Though, he didn't mind the snow. It had been a dry winter and he always enjoyed a white Christmas. Clicking the handle on the screen door with his palm, he started to push it open to take a step outside. But something was pushing back against him. After a second, he realized something was blocking the door. 	Upon further inspection, he found a small cardboard box sitting in front of the door. The box was maybe four inches tall and eight inches wide. There was a Christmas themed sticker on top. Red and green ornaments bordered the label that read, ""Mikey"" written in silver cursive. No other postage or stamps of any kind. This package was clearly delivered by hand, but it was very strange. No one had called him  since he was a boy. 	He stared at the box on the kitchen counter with crossed arms. Rubbing his chin, he pondered the package's possible contents and the reasoning behind the chosen name. He wasn't on a gift-giving level with any of his neighbors. His friends weren't exactly the ""thoughtful"" type; let alone think of a gift and hand deliver it. It seemed the only way to solve this mystery was with a rusting pair of kitchen scissors. 	The flaps popped open as he finished slicing the lone layer of tape atop the package. Inside he found a blank envelope. Lifting the piece of paper revealed a small white box in the same rectangular shape as the package, only half the size. Intrigued, he unsealed the envelope and took out a tiny stack of white cards. The message's font on the first was bold and black, reading:  OPEN ME IN THE GARAGE. 	Confused and visibly frightened, the card shook in his hand.  Shrugging off the warning, he snatched the tiny box from the package. Tearing open one end; something rolled out and into his hand. It was a black HOT WHEELS toy car. Examining it closer, he recognized it was a Ferrari. 	""Okay..."" he said, utterly baffled. 	He placed the toy car back in the package. Setting his sights back on the cards, hoping for any further instructions that could explain the odd giftsomething caught his eye.  He froze as his assumptions came to life. The package shook again. His body jumped back a step in response to the fear. Again, it shook; and then stopped. Gaining enough courage, he crept towards the package. It remained idle as he peered over the edge, grimacing with one eye closed. The tiny car sat inside, dormant. Suddenly, the sound of a jet engine ignited and the tires on the toy spun into action. Smoke started to spread through the kitchen as he feared his eardrums might explode from the reviving. Frantically, he went back to the cards in his hands. Over the tremendous growling of the package in front of him, he flipped to the second and last card. In the same font, it read:  I TOLD YOU. THE GARAGE.  	""Ahh!"" his shriek was embarrassing but justified. Acting on impulse, he gingerly grabbed the smoking package and turned for stairs. Scurrying down the steps, he carried the box as if it were a foul-smelling bag of trash. The two sets of stairs seemed more like ten. The blaring grew louder and louder, the closer he got to the garage. It was hard to tell through the smoke but it looked as though the car were growing. 	Finally, he reached the door. Wasting no time, he whipped it open and nearly ripped it out of its hinges. Tossing the ticking time bomb into his completely empty garage before he slammed the door shut. He dove back into the carpeting of his basement floorjust as the reviving engine hit its crescendo. He curled into a ball and braced for the inevitable explosion. It never came. 	After a minute of heavy breathing, he sat up and listened. Silence. Making his way to the garage door, he tapped the handle. Expecting the metal to burn his fingers, he was surprised by its cool touch. Down by his feet he noticed a fog rolling from underneath the door. Taking a deep breath, he creaked the door open. Smoke transferred from garage to basement as he coughed and waved at it. After the combustion settled enough to make out the damage, his jaw dropped. Sitting in his garage was a sparkling new, black Ferrari. 			The toy had grown into an  automobile. Amazed and shocked, his feet floated towards the sports car. His hands slid across its welcoming metal body. He wasn't crazy. It was real! There was an actual Ferrari in his garage! 	""Thank you! thank you!"" he yelled while hugging and kissing the car. ""Whoever you are! Thank you!"" Looking through the windows, he noticed something on the steering wheel. Sliding in the driver's side, he plopped into the warm leather. There was a card stuck in the center of the wheel. It was the same type of card he had found inside the package. In the familiar bold print, it said:  MIKEY, YOUR HEART WAS RIGHT. JAKE NEEDS TO BELIEVE IN ME NOW, MORE THAN EVER. DON'T LET HIS MAGIC BURN OUT. P.S. I know you said cherry red, but this was the best I could manage on such short notice."
The Hungry Christmas Tree,"The twenty-foot tree was magnificent!All forty-nine wee elves skipped around its base with strings of colored lights, silver tinsel, and finely crafted wooden ornaments. Its fresh, piney green scent was intoxicating, the elves buried their faces in the soft needley boughs.The elves giggled like squirrels, chattered like monkeys, and laughed like loons.As the last of the lights were lit, and the last of the ornaments hung, the elves discussed the finalethe decoration for the very tip-top.The angel was white, with tinsel hair, pale blue gossamer wings, and a gown sparkling with sugary glitter.She was nearly as tall as the largest elf, though made of paper and very light.A ladder would be of no use, on the highest rung of it, an elfs little arms wouldnt reach across to the treetop.In a velvet blue coat lined with white fur, Sissy Snowflake put two fingers to the corner of her mouth and whistled to get everyones attention.Her shrill expulsion blew steam from her pink pointy ears.As the colorful group of wee-folk quieted down, she asked them, Any new ideas this year?Why not just get Santa or the Missus to do it? Asked Niftybuttons, pushing his eyeglasses up his tiny pug nose. Bits of peppermint candy and assorted cookies pelted the elf a second later.Not an option.We do this on our own, Sissy said with her freckled nose in the air as if daring anyone to argue.A dark-haired elf in a lime green romper said, We have had some disastrous attempts in the pastA murmur zig-zigged through the crowd as they recalled the previous three years.The incident with the catapult had left Periwinkle missing her two front teeth, it had been painful watching her tackle her supper that night.The drone had flown straight into the top of the tree.It was as if a whirring, spitting, buzzsaw had been let loose: branches disintegrated in an explosion of pine needles and tinsel, the poor tree had been decapitated.Marcipans pet squirrel had been the most traumatizing.It had been trained for a whole month to place the angel just so, and all had gone very welluntil the squirrel ate the angels head.It had previously been made from an acorn.JingleBob said, I think the Elf Ladder will work this year.Look how big and strong JingleMel has grown The scrawny elf in moss green and yellow moved aside and his brother stepped up.JingleMel was indeed a hulk of an elf.In brown felt and fur, he looked more like a squat, roly-poly troll.As if on cue, the Gingerspatzel twins leapt onto each of JingleMels sturdy arms, they balanced on one foot each and bent like ballet dancers with toes extended, meeting over the burly elfs mop of dark curly hair.Sissy tapped a finger against her pouty pink lips, Hmm.Yes, I concur.This year the Elf Ladder will work just fine.The wee folk bounced over to the front of the tree, clapping and shouting, Me, me me! In high pitched voices like happy blue jays.Sissy strutted back and forth in front of them, pointing and saying, Youyouyou like a judge at the American Kennel Club.She stopped when she had twenty of them, lined up from the biggest- JingleMel, to the smallest- Urchinpoo, an elf of Asian descent, with dark, almond shaped eyes peeking from amidst a froth of pale pink marabou scarves. Her voice was one of a tiny mouse, ""Yay!"" She squeaked.Twenty should do it.Places everyone! Sissy shouted.One by one, the elves assembled, each smaller than the one before it, each climbing onto the shoulders of the elf under it.As Urchinpoo climbed the nineteen feet to the top, her understudy, a tiny thing in lavender named Periwinkle, rooted her on.She was frightened of heights and did not want to climb the Elf Ladder.The ladder swayed as a center elfs foot slipped from the shoulder beneath him.The crowd Ooooohed.Then Aaaahed as the line straightened back out.At the top, Urchinpoo regained her own footing, and the paper angel was passed along and up, in her direction.Sissy inspected the symmetry and balance of the tree.She was mesmerized by the soft golden lighting and gently wafting strands of old-fashioned tinsel.A cacophony of squeals and cries broke her trance.She yelled, Is anyone hurt?! To the tumble of elves before the tree.They were getting to their feet and rubbing bruised bums and elbows and knees.Periwinkle exclaimed, Wheres Urchinpoo?! The elves looked around, and as they spread out, it was clear the mini pink puffball was not amongst them.They looked under the low-lying branches and ran about calling her name.She was not anywhere in the house either.She had simply vanished.That night at the long supper table, forty-eight elves sat, with Santa at one end and his Missus at the other.They picked at their food and occasionally started conversation that petered out quickly as eyes inevitably wandered to the empty seat three down from Mrs. Klaus left.Sissy Felt especially awful.She was the unofficial leader of the elves pretty much, only because of her outspoken, bossy nature and felt responsible for each one.At the time of the disappearance, she had decided that Urchinpoo had to be playing a prank.Now, here in the dining room, the elves looked to her for answers, solutions, a game plan perhaps.Santa, king of the elves, said, Sissy Snowflake.Have you any clues?Any progress?Put on the spot, she suddenly didnt want the attention, for she had no answers.She hung her pretty head sadly.Well, in any case, we still need to complete the tree decoration. Santa said.After supper, the courtyard lanterns were lit, infusing the darkness with welcoming mellow light.A thousand Christmas lights reflected off the fresh snow, it sparkled as if sprinkled with colorful glitter.The elves formed their Elf Ladder with little merriment, little Periwinkle shook with fright as she ascended the tower.Third from the bottom, Boysenberry sneezed.A sneeze could take down the whole lotthey swayed to the left and right, then straightened up solidly.Whew.Cuppy Gingerspatzel was the elf at the top. As Periwinkle cautiously climbed her shoulders, Cuppy whispered, Youre doing great, Peri, just dont look down.Periwinkle had not dared to look downuntil then.The tower shuddered as Periwinkle lost her footing.Cuppy yelled, Elf down!Sissy had been watching the procession but had taken her eyes off the tiny, purpley elf when Boysenberry had sneezed.Now she scanned the ground and the tree branches.She called up to Cuppy, What do you mean?!No one fell!Cuppy replied, Well, she was here for a second!Now, shes not!She must have fallen!The elves disassembled and searched the courtyard for the lavender cloaked elf.Rolly Garopollo and JingleMel wheeled out the catapult from the garage.Sissy rolled her eyes and muttered, Why not.She stepped aside, watching the foot high wheels turn Wait! She cried.The catapult was just about to roll over something small and shiny half buried in the snow.A button.A purple one.Again, it seemed, an elf vanished into thin air.Cuppys sister, Cooperfield, climbed up the catapult and planted herself excitedly in the cup.She wore a wooden helmet over her bright copper-colored curls, only her large brown eyes peeked out.JingleBob passed her the paper angel then positioned himself, ready to press the release lever.Sissy said, On one, twothree!Sawiiiiiissssshhhh! Flew Cooperfield through the frosty air, she cried, Wheeeeeee--- Her voice cut off as she disappeared amidst the branches.The paper angel drifted down, see-sawing back and forth, wings fluttering as if she were trying to fly, like a baby bird falling too soon from its nest.JingleMel opened his arms and caught it, cradling it gently.What the? Said Sissy, blinking.Did you see that?! JingleBob exclaimed, Shes disappeared!Cuppy said, She must be in the tree!Im going in after her!Sissy held her back and said, something strange is going on here.I cant let you go in.I dont need your permissionPlease.Let me help you look.Cuppy nodded and Sissy called the biggest elves over.She needed them to tip the tree and lay it down on the ground.Rayray Goodcandy and his brother Bobo joined JingleMel and JingleBob.Sissy studied the Goodcandy brothers faces for ten full seconds, then narrowed her eyes and furrowed her brows.She asked them, When you cut this tree down yesterday, where did you get if from?The Goodcandys looked at each other, Rayray sheepishly said, The north woodsSissy persisted, Which north woods?Bobo said defensively, Its the best tree ever!We found a FOREST of perfect Christmas trees!Just a little further than we normally go. Added Rayray.Sissy said, You crossed the Red Field!It was no big deal, said Bobo.dont get what all the fuss is about, said Rayray.the chocolate was amazing. said Bobo.By now all the elves had gathered and were standing around the three with their mouths open and their eyes big as ping pong balls.Sissy, exasperated, said, Santa made a deal with the Red Wizard who lives in the Far North Woods.We dont cross his field, we stay out of his forest.In return, he doesnt eat uswaitwhat chocolate?Rayray said, We found chocolate,Bobo said, in the field,like someone had dropped it.""A trail,into the woods.Sissy exasperatedly looked from brother to brother.You Ninnyheads!The wizard must have wanted you to cut down this tree!Through the tree hes swiping elves!Poor Poo, and Coop, and Peri.Theyve surely been eaten.Well go and rescue them!"" Said Bobo.Santa can help..."" said Rayray.Sissy cried, Santa cannot hear of this!He will be furious that we broke the oath.We can go through the tree,"" said Bobo.just like---No! screamed Sissy, Well be eaten too!We must go the long way, over the field.You will have to show me exactly which way you went.The three elves headed to the Red Field at midnight.The night was crystal clear, the stars twinkled merrily, and the moon a lantern that led their way.It was pretty as a Christmas card. Although two feet of snow had fallen since the boys last trip across the field, it was easy to see the ditch that the tree had made as the brothers dragged it home.Sissy grew increasingly nervous. Halfway across, she stopped walking and whispered, Ive figured out whats so creepytheres no sound.The Goodcandys stopped and cocked their heads like terriers listening for the crinkle of a can opener opening a can.Rayray said, Shes right,no owls, no wolves,no crickets, no night-jaysA howl arose from the woods ahead of them and east.HIS woods.It was unlike any sound the three had ever heard.It was similar to a wolfs but more guttural, higher pitched, and a hundred percent menacing.Sissy felt every hair on her body stand up and quiver.She held her belly to quiet the roiling worms in it.The boys did the same.I dont think we should be out in the open like this.Cmon!She started running, the boys ran too.The elves tiny feet blurred over the glistening, blueish white expanse, so swift and light, they left no footprints. They reached the far side in two minutes. They leapt into the woods and crouched behind a tree as the eerie howl rose again, closer this time.Cautiously, they continued through the forbidden forest.It was not entirely silent anymore.Branches behind them snapped.Snow clumps  as they fell from tree limbs. And deep, ragged breathing trailed their path.As the thing grew closer, they heard heavy, crumping footfalls and strange slurping noises.Lights ahead twinkled through the trees ahead!There, deep in the Red Wizards Forest, was a castle.It was house-sized but a bona fide castle, nonetheless, complete with two towers with pointed, cone roofs, wide gables over the first story windows, and a drawbridge over a frozen moat.It appeared to be white frosted glass with blue crystals embedded all over.The moonlit, sparkling reflections made it appear to be alive and breathing even though the multipaned windows were dark.They circled the castle and around the back they found a maple tree by the shiny silver moat.Cmon said Sissy.She went to the tree and put her hands together like a step.Bobo stepped up and on to her shoulders.Rayray did the same to form an Elf Ladder.Rayray leapt upwards and caught the lowest bare branch.Then he pulled Bobo up, who pulled Sissy next.When they had climbed twenty feet up, they could see into the backyard of the sparkling castle home.Toss me over the wall, said Sissy.Bobo hung by his feet and took her hands in his.He rocked like a swing, back and forth.When he swung towards the wall, he let go of Sissys hands at the apex.She made her body long like Superman and flew over the wall.She rolled in a ball across the yard then raced to the backdoor.Through the window she saw a cozy, dark kitchen. The door was unlocked.Evil Wizards arent afraid of anything.She tip-toed across the cool tile floor, and stopped when she heard soft, whistley snoring.Periwinkle! She thought.For even though the dentist had crafted new teeth, shed snored ever since the accident.Behind the kitchen door, Sissy found the cage.Her three little friends were curled up in blankets.There was a bowl with a few chocolates and a candy cane in it, and another half full of milk. She thought, Its as if they are pets.She rattled the metal door and called out softly, Peri!Cooper!Urchinpoo!Wake up!Whaaa? said one of the girls.Suddenly the kitchen was flooded with brilliant white light!All four elves blinked and squinted in surprise.Aha!shouted the wizard.A trespasser!I shall add you to my collection!Sissy thought, That sure doesnt sound like an evil wizards voiceShe turned around and sawa miniature wizard?It was indeed a child.In purple pajamas with stars and planets all over them.On his head was a tall, pointed hat in a matching pattern.He wore fuzzy purple bunny slippers.Into the cage you go! cried the boy.He was three times her size, but she shook her head, refusing to move to the cage.He opened the cage door and said, If you dont get into the cage, my grandfather will eat you!Ha ha ha!Who says I eat elves? A voice boomed from the doorway.The tall, white-haired old wizard came into the kitchen, and said, Whats all the ruckus?He resembled a taller, thinner Santa, but wore a velvet robe so black it sucked in light.He looked angry, his eyes shot red sparks.Now, she was scared.Ah Granpoppa.This one refuses to get in the cage.Well I dont blame her.To Sissy he said, You elves have broken the two-hundred-year oath.You are now mine to do what I like with.It was a terrible mistake!The two that cut down your elf-eating tree were lured into your forest by chocolate. TheyWEare very truly sorry and will do anything to make it up to you.Granpoppa, you cant let them go!Theyre my pets!Sissy understood then, that the child was simply lonely.Wizards were infamously known for being recluses.This poor child simply wanted playmates.The old scary wizard looked at the boy wizard and said, Is that true Sefton?You lured the elves into my forest with chocolate?The boys eyes filled with tears.He nodded.The wizards face broke into a grin.He went from scary monster to cheery fun uncle.He said, Well, then this is just as much your fault as it is the elves.Please dont send them away. Seftons small voice quavered.Sissy said, Why dont you come over and play with us?Sefton looked up.He sniffled and wiped his eyes with his sleeve.He looked at his grandfather and said, Can I?Well, its odd for a wizard to want to be around other beings He shuddered and continued, but I cant see any harm in it if it makes you happy.Oh boy!Friends!The young wizard clapped with joy.Weve got to get home now, before Santa wakes up, hell be very worried to find three more elves missing.Three? asked the big wizard.Oh!Yes, my friends are out in that maple tree, waiting for us.To get back, you will have to go through the tree-portal.The zombie wolverine that guards the woods is quite fearsome.Sefton threw a rope ladder over the wall, the Goodcandy boys climbed over.The sky was pinking with a new dawning day.There was a tree in the castle yard, identical to the elves tree but with fewer decorations, and little tinsel.The tall wizard stood on a wooden ladder and one by one, the elves were tossed into the tree.An hour later, they came back through the tree.When young Sefton, the mini-wizard, came out to meet his new friends he saw that his own Christmas tree was now sparkling with tinsel, covered in twinkling lights, and at the tip-top sat a beautiful paper angel."
Lightless,"I cant sleep. Sometimes sleep wont come to you. No matter what you do to catch it. No matter how hard you try. Sleep wont come. If Luna was there, she would probably tell me sleep is not something you can order around. She would tell me this, in that soothing voice of hers. That sleep never comes to the ones who wish to catch it. But Luna is not here. 	Still cant sleep. She would surely tell me a tale never to forget, which would instantly fade away. She would tell me about a flock of birds, flying far away from it all. Or about the snow, falling off and slithering through the stream. With every single word of hers, with every blink of my eyes, the world would fade a little further. I would leave my house. My street. My town. The clouds would get closer and closer, until what had once been the snow of her stories completely covered me. Until I flew with the flock of birds that she had told me so much about.	Right when I would fight my hardest to fall back into my home and listen to her story, I would dream. I would jump from my world and land into a whole new one. The one where hopeful people live, when night strips the world from its light. Where love is born in a heartbeat, and beats all odds against it. The place where she would dance with more passion than her own shadow. But shes not here anymore. The stories are gone. The dreams are gone. And I cant sleep. 	Screw it. Shirt. Trousers. Shoes. Coat. Keys. Out. Leaving the house. Nothing left for me here in this sleepless night.	I shut the door behind me and stare. Nothing but darkness ahead. No one - no sound. A naked, empty space. This is not my town. My town has people laughing in it. People living. My town has bright trees - trees that shake in the days wind. My town is not silent or dark, and yet it is now. It looks nothing like in the pictures. In them, you can see everything clearly. Just the way it is. The way it has always been. The way its supposed to be  lively, sunny. It doesnt even look like a painting. Any worthy painter would see this town and make it shine. Gorge the streets with light. Fill them with life.	But theres none of that here. Just fragments of what I know - pieces of a body. The churchs door, but not its tower. The trees trunk, but not its branches. The streets pavements, but not its people. The truth faded away. Now Im left with pieces of it all.  	Thats what Luna would have said, had she been there. But she isnt. I would have gone back inside. My mind wanted to. My legs, on the other hand, had an inexplicable urge. Hatable urge to walk the dimly lit streets ahead. So I did. Just me, walking, sleepless - out in the street - just me and the street lights. I like street lights. Theyre just like memories. They help you find your way when youre lost. Luna had always hated having street lights hanging around her. She used to say that they looked like stars in cages. In her mind, men needed to possess every possible thing and thought, to the point where they gripped the lights out of the sky to trap them. Down here, with us.  Maybe she was right, in a way. Its not like she would see any stars shining in the sky tonight; if she was looking. Not like I can see them either. But there are street lights all over. Whats the big difference, anyway? As long as theres light, theres sight.	There were a few stars left in the sky, when Luna was still here. We used to look at them from the top of our little hill. It was so small. 	. 	Thats how her words dragged you in. Every little thing seemed so much more complex, when you looked at it with Luna. Even the simplest of circles would start looking nebulous, if she stood next to you. The whole universe danced around you, when you went on that hill with her. So I did.	She used to say the silliest things. In the summer, when we sat on that hill together, she liked to speak to me about anything. Everything. The trees leaves. She would ask what would happen if leaves could fly away instead of falling off the trees. Whenever she said those things, I would always react the same way. I used to look at her with confused eyes. That made her laugh.	But leaves cant fly away.I would argue. She would answer that they cant, except when they can. So I would keep disagreeing with her: But thats simply not possible. They have to fall at some point. To that, she would answer in the calmest of voices that they did, except when they didnt. 	Still walking - walking and thinking. Leaves cant fly, Obviously. Yet I would stop arguing with her, because there was no point to it. There was no way of winning with Luna. Her words were not made of logic or sense. Her words were made of wonderful letters, combining in the strangest of ways. Entangled, not to form sentences, but to vibrate in the air. Those vibrations would move through the wind, the wind would touch a bird, the bird would fly and so would she; in a way. .	Her mind always wandered to the strangest of places, that I understood nothing about. Places with no clear light showing her the way to go. Places where the light followed her, instead of her following the light.	Where her feet fell and met the ground, thats where a path would appear.	It was dark, in her mind - not a somber darkness, not an obscure one either - a darkness full of fragments floating around, dislocated from other pieces. Letters with no words, towns with no sun, leaves with no trees, birds flying away. . 	I would like to pretend that I hated her paradoxes, her illogicalness, her pieces of insanity. Even back then, sometimes I wanted to tell her that none of herself made any sense; but I never said that. I knew what she would say if I did, so we simply spoke through our gaze.	No matter how angry I would look, she always stayed calm. Her eyes would let their wing-like lashes bat for a moment; facing me, mesmerizing me. Right when she knew that I could no longer look away, her eyes would say There was nothing I could answer, other than a smile. So I smiled - smiled and followed her with a light - into a whole new darkness. Now shes gone. And every step I once walked with her is filled with light, because I see it all so clearly - memories in my mind like stars in street lights. If she knew how much light there is in my mind where she once stood, she would look at me with her other gaze - not her charming, loving one, which made me feel like nothing else in the world mattered. Instead, she would stare into my eyes for just a moment, before looking away and never back at me. Guess thats the gaze shes giving me now.	She would have preferred to stay out of anyones sight - like a wild animal, that everyone wishes to see but that no one can get close to. A subtle, mythical creature. One which hid behind the clouds, yet shone through them. A fantastical phoenix, flying far away from reality, failing to face a fading future. .	Even if I remember everything, every single moment with her - even if I flooded all of them with light. Even then, she still won. No matter how many pieces I try adding together, she still makes no sense to me. As I am thinking about it all, she still escapes the light surrounding her. It could never quite catch her. It never will. Luna, the one girl beyond reason, beyond meaning, beyond light.	She never wanted to catch me in return. That might be the most painful part of it. She wanted me to be free, all I wanted was to be hers. I ended up belonging to no one. Just like her. What does that make me? A person, an animal? An angel, a demon? He, she? I.	I will never capture her the way I would have wanted to. She will never capture me because she would never want to. That shining darkness of hers slipped through my heart; like water through the fingers of a man, dying in the drought.	If I could go back in time and ask her one thing, then I would ask again: What do you mean, leaves that dont fall but fly? I would shake her. Catch her unreachable shoulders and shake her. I would beg her until she would let me make sense of her world. A world that would not belong. That would simply be. A world where love still exists. A world where leaves fly away. 	5Still walking. Walking and remembering. There was a day - a sad day - one in which her eyes refused to meet mine. On that day, she said,  She said that I should stop trying to grab everything. That I should let things fly away. But what sense does that make? If a leaf will fall, then it will fall. What difference will it make if I grab it beforehand? What difference does it make if I want it to be mine?	None of that matters, anyway. Because on the last day I saw Luna, on our very last goodbye, we stood next to a tree.	I cant quite remember what words she used on that day. My mind wont illuminate such a memory. All that its dim light can bring back is the voice that she spoke with. Her words werent floating in the air and vibrating with the birds. Her words fell on me like leaves falling off branches; branches falling off trees, trees falling off the world. Everything fell .	Every soft snow flake was changed into an impetuous ice storm, every swinging leaf into a curled up memory of the fall,.	As she walked away from me - as she said her very last goodbye, in the harshest voice I had ever heard her utter - the last leaf fell from the tree. A bird took its place. Then more birds came along.	The ravens looked at me. They stared and hushed. Even they would not speak in presence of such misery. I stayed and stared back at them. Waiting. Not knowing what else to do. They curled up on themselves and left me  alone - with my thoughts.	They covered the tree. Perhaps out of sorrow - sorrow for what had fallen - what Luna would never let me catch. All of the leaves were dead at its feet and at mine. Lifeless. Thats where she left me. Above death. I looked at the discolored leaves and they said nothing.	On that day, she pierced an ever growing hole within me - I sunk in it. Out of those beautiful snowy clouds, out of the sky with the flocks of birds, out of the lands where she stood in front of me. Back into my own street - my own house; right into a dark place A somber darkness, An obscure one. One without the light of her eyes to guide me. The lights in my mind bring me to her eyes once more. They were not clear, simple circles, her eyes - at least not when you focused on them and really, truly looked. They were nebulous. Like the edges of a grass-covered hill.	The gaze that she would give me whenever I was angry. The guilty gaze, which also spoke of love. The one which said  I miss that gaze.	Maybe she was right, after all. Maybe that was why I loved her. Her will never to get caught - to fly amidst the wind and storms. To be a leaf which falls  - the small things. The sparkles of light in a sea of beautiful darkness; night sky, like the one slowly disappearing above me. Its strange to think that all which once made me feel complete is now the reason why I am so torn. Why I cant sleep. 	Numb. Empty. Thats what you become when your heart gets ripped out of your chest. But then why cant I sleep? A hole doesnt look for sleep, so what makes me so different from it? Then again, a hole doesnt have needs. I need her. I need her world back into mine, I need to fall back into her land, into a long gone hope - sleep.	I wish I could simply be mad at her. I wish I could blame her for what happened. But I cant, because every single one of my memories, every single light brings me back to her. In this ocean of sparkling stars, she is the moon.	Now that shes gone, theres nothing left but that oceans cold water and my little street lamps.	If I could do it all again, I would not ask her to explain things to me. If I could change anything, then I would beg for a leaf to fly. I would beg the wind to carry it up and never let it down. Never would I let my hands grab it. I would see the leaves fly in her world and love would be possible again. But its not. And leaves fall.  	I keep on walking alone on this road. It makes more sense to me than she ever did. A road with light starting to dawn on it - A clear path. There are no turns or holes - Its perfectly perfect in every way. But then why do I wish it had spots and tree leaves falling on it?	Out of my town. Not a single flaw on this, perfect, grey road. I see this road just the way it is. The way it has always been. The way its supposed to be. Lively. Sunny..	I know which village this road will lead me to. The village will never move. Neither will my town. . I see the village from here already  perfectly perfect - just like this road. Why do I wish for its houses to be stained and its church to be crooked?	Im on the clearest path, but that path leads me nowhere; nowhere that I care about. Not a place where leaves fly, just a place with perfectly perfect people.	Only the same old road Ive always known. Whats the use of the same road when you want something new? This is not mid-day, this is dawn. I want a new path to walk down on. One which has never seen me before and one without any light.	Thats when I saw it. On the side, hiding like a wild animal - probably full of wild animals. Another path. A flawed one; full of dirt, mud, grass. I would have stayed on the perfectly perfect road. My legs wanted to. My mind, on the other hand, had an inexplicable urge. unstoppable urge to walk the muddy path ahead. So I did. My feet; one after the other, plunging out of the light and into a new darkness. Where my feet fell and met the ground, thats where a path would appear.	Theres fog all over down here, snow-like fog, covering me, making everything blurry - nebulous. The dust illuminated by rays of new-born sunshine dash the only form of light present here. Stars, in a sky darkened by hundreds of naked branches. Perhaps thats just enough.	Letting my eyes hop from one star to another, they fall at last on something else, new. A tree.	The tree trunk has freckles on it. Stained by time. Beautiful. I look up and see its crooked branches. Beautiful. At last, I see its leaves, black leaves, all over the tree. One of them moves a little with the wind, then agitates its wings, another starts croaking, and its leaf friend answers with some singing of its own. Bird-leaves.	One of the bird-leaves starts to move more than the others, and all of a sudden, it falls. I get ready to catch it, then stop myself. 	Before crushing down, the leaf opens its wings and starts flying. All of the croaking and singing leaves leave, one by one, to a warmer place. 	Luna left me for a warmer place. I hope she found it. 	Pulling my hands back, I let my eyes stare. I watch. I just watch little birds leaving, little leaves leaving. As the last one soars through the sky, I see it. The leaf that flies and never falls. I see it and fall asleep."
Ruby and the Rat,"Long ago, on a day like so many before it, a distant clock tower chimed the hour. The sun rose, casting its radiant light over the snow-laden land. In a small shack on the edge of the village, the golden rays warmed Rubys face. The young woman gripped her blanket, her one luxury, and snuggled her sleepy face into its warm embrace. The fire had died long ago and she held onto the warmth of her bed as long as possible in the cozy haze of dawn. She dared to open her eyes. The glistening snow shone beautifully outside, and the sun, nestled on the horizon, greeted her.	Ruby gasped, jumping to her feet. The cold floor on her bare skin shocked her awake but was not nearly as effective as the realization that she was, once again, late. She traded her nightgown for her dusty dress and ragged apron, threw her hair up with haste, and pulled on her bright red coat and boots as she stumbled out the door. Ruby flew over the snow toward the village. She followed the scent of fresh-baked cinnamon rolls and the clang of the blacksmiths hammer. Everyone in town loved Ruby and everyone knew she suffered from a bad case of tardiness.	Late again Ruby! chuckled the baker as she ran past. He tossed her a muffin, knowing she needed fuel for what lay ahead.	Thanks, Felix! Ruby called back, stuffing her mouth with the warm bread.	She passed the grocer, the blacksmith, the candlestick maker, waving with a smile at everyone as she went. The village sprang to life and the bustle began, but Ruby had no time to enjoy the liveliness. She wound around people, weaving through obstacles, and eventually ended up at the castle gardens. She slipped through the thick foliage and quietly sought out her secret hole in the back wall where she could sneak into the kitchens unnoticed. Just a row of hedges twice her heigh stood between her and the wall. She knelt down and crawled through the tangled branches when a tiny squeak caught her attention.	She paused a moment before continuing on, but the squeak once more found her ears. Snow soaked through her dress and froze her knees. Time urgently pushed her forward. But she stopped and looked around for the source of the squeak. Her eyes landed on a lump of mottled fur, barely hidden by the edge of the shrub. She eased forward and found a rat with a crooked tail, lame leg, and eyes full of sorrow. Her soul ached at the thought of the little guys heart pumping furiously as he ran from a hawk. It had surely been a close duel, the rat barely escaping with his life. Ruby reasoned his chances were slim, but with proper care, he might just make it. She scooped him up, brushed the snow from his fur, and placed him gently in her apron pocket.	Weve got a long day ahead of us, but youre under my care now, she whispered as they squeezed through the stone wall.	The kitchens heat already sweltered as the staff hurried about cooking more food than could possibly be necessary. She blended in perfectly. Ruby hung her coat and went to work. She grabbed a handful of linens and headed to the queens chambers. But not before placing a handful of nuts in her apron pocket.	She made the bed and rolled the old sheets to the laundry then moved on to dusting various trinkets before Princess Abigail found her.	Mother knows you were late again, the child sneered, her nose in the air.	Im so sorry Princess, Ruby bowed her head before the girl and quickly returned to work.	Mother also said apologies are worthless if you dont change your actions. Of course, never have to apologize for anything. A princess is nothing short of perfect.	Ruby endured excess words from the queen and her daughter on a daily basis. She learned to ignore them and continue on. The slender child, clad in shiny jewels and frills turned dramatically and headed for the door. She left Ruby relieved for her early departure.	Oh, the child in the doorways grin grew wide and wicked, Mother said as punishment, youre to clean the chamber pots today! Princess Abigail giggled with malicious vigor all the way down the hallway.	In between tasks, Ruby would take the rat from her apron and wipe his fur. Shed talk to him sweetly, and wrap him in scraps of warm cloth. She fed him the nuts from the kitchen and dubbed him Pistachio. Pistachio snuggled into her apron a rested well with a full stomach. He listened as Ruby endured verbal abuse from the castles occupants. And he listened as she went about her work, singing merrily as she did. Room after room, she kept busy, worked diligently, while still finding time to tend to Pistachio. He admired how she made games out of her tasks and maintained a pleasant attitude.	As the sun dipped low in the sky, Ruby tended to her last chore of the day: cleaning the queens bath chamber. Thered be clothes to take to the laundry, drain and scrub the clawfoot tub, then wrap up with mopping and watering the plants. She reached for the doorknob, but it opened before her. Queen Violet stepped out, draped in plum robes of velvet adorned with beautiful gold filigree. It was the only thing beautiful about her.	She looked down on Ruby and spoke, You better not be late another day, lest it be your last, she smirked and opened the door wide for Ruby to enter, I want this room spotless before you leave, she let out a chuckle accompanied by a snort. Her heels clicked down the hallway, the echoes marking her departure.	Ruby stepped into the room, her smile faded and shoulders slumped. Vases lay smashed and towels lay strewn about thoroughly soaked. Mud tracked across the floor and clung to the sides of the tub.	What on earth happened here? Ruby sighed. Something ran into her shins, knocking her to her knees. She steady herself as something hot and wet slapped her face. Ruby raised her head to gaze into the amber eyes of the worlds scruffiest dog. Her radiant smile instantly returned to her face.	I bet you did this, she said stroking the puppys damp fur. He looked at her expectantly, tail wagging furiously and tongue flopped to the side, How am I supposed to clean all this with you running about? She posed the question to herself and scanned the room for a leash. Nothing. The puppy nosed her apron, sniffing it with curiosity. She pulled away, afraid the prodding snout might harm Pistacio. But the small rat popped his head up and sniffed the dog in return. He wrapped his tiny fingers around the edge of the pocket.	Are you sure? Ruby asked.	The rat looked at her face in return and Ruby took the action as an answer. She scooped out Pistacio and his cloth and fashioned a bed for him on an end table. He burrowed back into the warmth before popping his head out ever so slightly. The puppy ran to the end table, skidding to a stop a mere inch before hitting it. He looked up eagerly at the rat but refused to bother him otherwise. Satisfied, Ruby set to work, face aglow with joy once more.	Night fell long before Ruby completed her chores and left the castle behind, Pistachio in tow. Fresh snow fell from the silver speckled sky. She gripped her brilliantly colored, yet tattered coat tight and walked quickly. She passed through the village where most people already sat in their homes for dinner. The alabaster moon glistened off the snowy streets, and warm firelight glowed through frosted windows. Scents of meats and spices wafted on the air, and the tavern sounded alive with happy patrons. Ruby longed to take her time and enjoy the sights and smells, to join the people in the tavern and dance and sing. But the night was far too cold, and far too late.	Ruby reached her door to find a letter fixed to a ceramic pot. Inside she placed the items on her table and started a fire. Returning to the mystery package, she opened the letter. She instantly recognized the crude penmanship as belonging to Axlan the Blacksmith. 			  	Ruby cherished the couples kindness and fixed the pot over the fire to heat the delicious gift. She sat down to a delicious meal and every other spoonful of broth went to Pistachio. After dinner, she quickly tidied her room and tucked Pistachio into his cloth on her nightstand. She told the sleepy rat a short bedtime story before drifting off to sleep herself. 	The next morning, the clocktower chimed in the distance. The sun once again beckoned Ruby to wake. Once again, she took a look outside and realized she was going to be late. With no time to snuggle under the covers and allow her body to gently rise, she sprang out of bed. She threw on her dress, her apron her socks with perfected ease. She grabbed her boots, her coat, and of course, Pistachio, and she raced out the door.	She trotted down the path and onto the main road. As she passed through the village a curious sight befell her eyes. Not a soul trespassed the streets. The snow lay untouched, the forge stood cold, and the bakers ovens were bare. The sun rested low on the horizon. Ruby slowed down to examine the area.	Whats going on? Is it possible Im early?	She pondered the thought, and though she was sure she rose from her bed late, what else could explain the sleeping town? A glance toward the clocktower confirmed her suspicions. Her concern abated, she continued to the castle. The guards stood at the gates, unwavering as always, but suspiciously still. Years had passed since Ruby last used the gates. She couldnt wait to see the surprise on her friends faces when she arrived not late, but early. But as she entered the castle, the halls were, like the village, devoid of life. She checked the clock in the main hall. It read the exact same time as had the clocktower she spied minutes earlier. Perhaps it was broken. She moved from room to room and each clock read the same time as when shed passed through the village.	Pistachio crawled out from her apron and rested on her shoulder.	One clock could be broken, dear Pistachio. But every single one? Do you know whats happening?	The rate stared at her blankly and blinked.	She inhaled deeply and let out a long breath, Well, she thought for a moment, I still have work to do.	Ruby went about the rest of her day as usual. She took her time as she cleaned room after room, pausing every so often to play with or feed Pistachio. Though the silence caused her heart to grow lonely, she remained grateful that no one could speak harsh words to her or create extra messes for her to clean. When she completed her work, she packed up Pistachio and headed home. The village stood empty and pristine just as it had that morning. Ruby tried with all her might to squash a growing fear as she walked through the undisturbed streets. She fixed a simple meal for her and her rat before going to bed with the sun still peeking over the horizon.	The next morning Ruby awoke to the predawn darkness. She sat at the edge of her bed, thankful that at least the sun had moved. She took her time that morning, getting dressed with care and smoothing out her hair with a brush. She even made a modest breakfast. But as she searched for Pistachio, she found his makeshift bed empty. She searched under her bed, in her shoes, and behind her table, but the rat was nowhere to be found. Unwilling to waste the extra time she gained that day, she headed out for the castle alone. The clocktower chimed in the distance.	As she neared the village a large commotion drew her attention. Cheer gleamed on everyones faces, and from scattered conversations, she learned the castle hosted a special guest. No one seemed aware of the previous days conundrum.	Ruby! called Felix, You couldnt have picked a better day to be on time.	Whats all the fuss about? she inquired.	A wizard traveled from far away to visit the castle today. They say he has a special gift. You should get going so you dont miss it.	Felix hurried Ruby along, slipping a sweet roll in her hand. The path bustled with people, all voraciously trying to find a place in the castle. Fortunately, Ruby had her secret entrance. She squeezed through the wall and into the kitchen. She fought through another throng of bodies on her way to the throne room. Ruby barely fit in the chamber full of raucous gossip. She twisted her way through the crowd to the side where she miraculously found a bucket to stand on. Looking over the crowd, she spied the mysterious stranger. Next to Queen Violet in her plum robes and Princess Abigail in her pink frills stood a tall, slender man. He wore a robe of midnight blue. Beady eyes poked out through his bushy, mottled hair and beard. Ruby thought something about the old man looked familiar as he popped pistachios into his mouth, though she was certain shed never laid eyes on him before.	Once the room filled with as many people as it could possibly hold, the queen stood up. Silence fell over the room and the woman began to speak.	Thank you all for gathering here today, Ruby rolled her eyes because the queen never thanked anyone for anything, but Queen Violet continued with false pleasantries, We are honored to receive a very special guest, The Wizard Liri!	The old man pocketed the rest of his nuts and stepped forward.	Good people, I am here today to bestow a gift on one your own, his voice boomed louder than anticipated, I will share my talents with one very special person today.	The room buzzed with murmurs of excitement. The Queen quieted the room once more, and not so subtly shifted her daughter closer to the wizard.	Ive met someone who impressed me greatly with her attitude, he continued, her diligence, Princess Abigale stuck her nose high in the air, and her kindness. This young woman shall, from this day forward, be blessed with the ability to live her life sharing her goodwill with those who value her. And through her good fortune, she shall never want for anything again. 	Princess Abigail snorted as confusion crossed her face. A princess, after all, already commands the attention of the people and is showered with everything she could ever want.	Liri turned toward the queen, Your highness, in bestowing this gift that will help your entire kingdom, I ask one thing in return.	Queen Violet, barely paying attention at this point said, Of course, what is it that you want?	I only ask that this person be protected from anyone who would wish her harm.	The queen, believing her daughter the only likely candidate for such a gift, of course, agreed. A thin thread of shimmering magic flowed from The Wizard Liris fingertips as he bound the queen to her promise.	Now, Ruby, please step forward if you accept this offer.	The entire crowd erupted in surprised whispers. Surely he could not mean Ruby, the commoner who cleaned the rooms. Princess Abigail balled her fists and spun on her heels to glower at the wizard. But the room parted, clearing a way for Ruby. As she stepped forward on trembling legs, the villagers, who were all fond of her, softly congratulated her, patting her shoulder and offering kind words on her way.	She stood before the old man, at a loss for words. Shed never met this man before, how did he know her.	Ruby, do you promise to help your fellow villagers, to live your life spreading kindness and love?	The queen interrupted, This is a joke right? Her shrill voice cut through the room, Youre kidding?	Liri ignored her and focused on Ruby.	Yes, Ruby whispered, But, why me? What have I possibly done to deserve this?	Ive seen how hard you work yet you ask for nothing. Ive watched you show kindness to even the smallest of creatures, he leaned in and whispered the next words so that only she could hear, How did you know pistachios were my favorite?	Ruby gasped as she realized who stood before her. She threw her arms around the wizard, her tiny companion over the past two days, and hugged him. Pistachio had not disappeared after all, merely returned to his true self after she helped him heal. 	Ruby lived her remaining days working for no one but herself. Day after day she used her magic to help those in her village however she could. And in the evenings she lived her life, enjoying her beautiful surroundings, sharing meals with her friends, and dancing in the tavern. She never again endured the harsh words of the queen and spread her natural light with everyone she met."
The Sleepy Clcok,"Tic, Tic Tic, Tic.The granular sound of each second passing was constant.Laying on the unkempt sofa, dreaming of summer days when I was younger; I had my eyes closed to the world.Tic, Tic, Tic.The sombre rattlings of an old clock pierced my ears with the passing of each moment.My time, however, was being spent in my imaginings.The playful, days I spent at the creek, or simply rolling down what I thought at the time was a massive hill.Going back years later, I realized the hill was nothing but a pile of dirt; only as high as I am now.Tic, Tic.The striking of the second hand from my old shelf clock, although forceful on my ears, was non the less perfect.Perfect for the ability to dream but not to sleep.The slight noise keeping my keen mind from passing into unconsciousness.Perfect for my imagination to have the most vivid perceptions of the reality which was in my head.Tic.So, I dreamt on, and on.Very few joys remain to me.I cherish those moments the bring me a sense of beguilement and pleasure.The sounds of the clock, which I have had for many years, bring me back to all the good times in my past.Keeping those memories close to my heart, gives me a sample of the joy I once had rushing through my life. Resting where I was, I paused in mid thought.I was no longer thinking of the time I ran home with leaches on my arm, asking my mom for salt.Those things hated salt and fire, but I was a bit of a pyro, so I was only ever given the salt.Now, at this moment though I was simply, just on my sofa.Not to warm but not cold either.I was suddenly unable to think, to dream and to have my peace in which I so strongly appreciate.I pondered the oddity of the moment; I am usually quite good at fantasizing in this particular spot.Then it struck me, or perhaps stopped striking me.The sound I cherished to help me in my dreaming endeavours, was no more.Silence was what I was hearing.My eyes still closed, I thought not of the past, but now of why I didnt hear my old clocks silky sounds.Two things came to mind.One, the batteries had died.Which is a likely thing to happen.The second, which I doubt, was that it had broken.I fear not think of the second option, for sanitizes sake. Reluctantly, I opened my tired eye and sat up to have a look.The clock had indeed stopped.That wasnt a shocking revelation, the sound missing was an enormous clue.The slight irritation of something failing its one task just seemed to a sense of melancholy.I strolled over to the dresser drawer where I keep my spare AAs.Got what I needed and went to the clock.Bing-botta-boom, put the batteries in.There was no change, the silence was still defining.My clock, I thought to myself.My clock is in-fact broken..Letting the dread sink in for a moment, I opened my mind to the possibility it was just a bad set of batteries.So, in true delight I got some from my remote which I knew were good and tried those.But then the dread came back when I saw there was no change.A damper expression crossed my face, and the reality of my situation was cemented.There was nothing left to do.I had just utterly exhausted my abilities on fixing a broken clock, meagre as they were.So, in true defeatist fashion, I decided to do something I can do quite well.I decided to go to bed. Stepping into my bedroom, I peered at the other clock I owned.This one was my least favourite clock.It didnt send me off into the most wondrous memories, but instead it bluntly woke me, the fuck up.It wasnt a thing I enjoyed, its place in my home was one of pure necessity.Like a smoke alarm or my ex who paid the rent, and it too was broken.Well, when I say broken, I mean stopped.Both my clocks were stopped, and at the same time.I found this odd, and in a moment of curiosity I took out my phone to have a gander.It wouldnt even turn on.My home, which I honestly see as a refuge from the toils of the world, seems to have spitted me in some odd way.I wasnt having it. Knock, Knock, Knock Now what?.I thought, thinking of all the oddities this evening was bringing me.I suppose another odd thing, like a late visitor, was not unexpected.My aunt always told me bad things always happen in threes.If the third thing wasnt this character stabbing me, I suppose I dont mind entertaining his presence and saying hello.I could always ask him for the time. I thought in jest. Opening the door gingerly, I saw a fresh-faced and well-dressed man.A thin cut dark suit, thin tie, polished leather shoes and a charming smile.All-in-all, he seemed harmless and pleasant.Hello, he said.His voice echoed with purpose and presence.Hello, how can I help you?Its a little take if you dont mind me saying.. Is it?, he replied.Looking down at his watch.Then tapping it a few times.Huh, my watch must have stopped, what a funny thing to happen..Looking at him with an odd gaze a side, I actually just had my clocks stop as well.Thats a very peculiar coincidence.But what is it you are selling?.After I said this, he paused and looked a little more serious in his posture; like he was going to give a great speech to millions or sell one hell of a vacuum. He then told me a fantastic tale.Of how I was in fact on the couch still, at this very moment.That my clock had simply stopped, and I fell asleep; dreaming of doing to bed.  He said, dreams seem real at times.  Our brains mistake them for whats true.  Ideally we can tell real from not.  But, our sanity is the cost.   I told him, where to go and closed the door quite hard.  ""I couldn't be dreaming could I"", I though.  Not while I'm very clearly awake and seeing so vividly the world around me.  I kind of wish he was selling a vacuum, at least then I'd have gotten an offer or something that was real.   As soon as my mind wondered to idea he was correct however, I noticed how fluid things had gotten.  Like I was in control of reality, and not the other way around.  After a moment of realization, and contemplation.  I realized he was right I was in fact dreaming.  I had to be dreaming.  My girlfriend thought out that old clock and couch years ago."
A Quiet Kind of Magic,"I startled at the whistle of my tea kettle. I was usually the only one making noise this late at night.	It was my fourth Christmas alone since my grandmother had died. She was my mother and my father, and, for the most part, was one of the only people I ever really knew growing up. I missed her dearly.	Every Christmas Eve since I could remember, she and I would sit in the living room sipping on piping hot mugs of spiced black tea with orange slices. Its my favorite smell and my favorite memory.	I walked into the kitchen and removed the kettle from the heat, letting it cool just slightly before pouring the water over a tea bag, cinnamon stick, and orange slice. As soon as it became fragrant, my grandmother was right there with me, I just knew it.	I love you, grandma, I whispered to her. Merry Christmas Eve.	When the tea was finished steeping, I brought it into the living room along with a plate of fresh, buttery shortbread cookies and set them down on the floor. I plugged in my little Christmas tree -- only three feet tall -- and admired the way I always did. Never was my inner-child more alive than in this moment.	The tree was simple: decorated only with the lights, silver tinsel, and some pinecones I collected in my yard. But it was enough. There were no presents beneath, and I was much too old for Santa to think to visit me anymore. I grinned at the silly thought.	I swirled around the last of the tea, now cold at the bottom of my cup, and finished it off, along with the last cookie. Sorry, Santa. As I stood to return my dishes to the kitchen, I swore I heard four swift knocks at my door. What on earth? I was certainly not expecting company. My one dear friend was a state away visiting her family. There was simply nobody it could have been. But I stole a glance out of the peep hole to be sure, and there was nobody. Maybe a branch or an icicle fell I turned around and as soon as I did, I heard it again!	Quickly, I opened the door to see who was there, but I was all alone. Snow was falling and my yard was covered in it, yet there were no footprints to be seen. A shimmer near my feet caught my eye, and there was a little package wrapped in brown paper and golden ribbon with this address on it. How strange. Theres no post today, and definitely not at night. I flipped on my porch light and swept over the yard once more, and there wasnt a trace of anybody else.	I picked up the package and brought it inside, turning off the porch light and locking the door nice and tight behind me. I set my dirty dishes and the little box on my dining table and just stared at it. Curiosity had its grip on me, so I picked it up and gave it a little shake, like a child trying to guess what they got for Christmas. It was very light and the only sound it made was a soft metallic clink. I was not expecting a package and I was starting to feel a little spooked by the whole thing.	Looking at it again, the handwriting matched my grandmothers quite a lot, but I obviously dismissed that notion. A lot of older women wrote in a similar way, as they were taught. I was flooded with a wave of emotion and nostalgia in spite of the logic.	With hesitation, I tore back the paper to reveal a small, pine box. Nothing spectacular. The wood was thin and honestly looked quite cheap. On one side, there was a latch that I flipped upward to open the box.	I drew in a sharp breath when I saw the silver locket sitting on a small blue cushion inside. Thats impossible	It was a locket that I recognized immediately as belonging to my grandmother. She wore it often, but when she died, it was one item that I was never able to find among her things. Not in her bedside table or jewelry box or closet. I gave up on it, sadly. But there it was, sitting right in front of me after four years. It didnt make sense.	The box contained nothing else, not even a note. Shivers ran down my spine while I tried to make sense of what was nothing short of a Christmas miracle. I took the locket and sat back down in the living room, beside the Christmas tree. I flipped it over in my hands and watched as the lights from the tree glistened and reflected off the surfaces of the locket and just sat there in that moment. In that incredible feeling. I felt like I should have been at least slightly afraid, but no. Nothing but calm and, well, wonder, surrounded me there.	Ghosts arent something I ever paid much mind to. I didnt believe or not believe. I just didnt think about those sorts of things. Yet, I was so sure that there was something beyond me that was making this happen. I love you, grandma, I whispered to nobody in particular.	I looked up at the little clock that hung on my wall and noticed it was just a quarter after midnight, shortly after grandma and I would have gone to sleep. she always told me. The last thing we did before huddling under the covers was sprinkle a few handful of oats across the front yard for the reindeer to graze on while Santa was busy doing his job. It was only fair. He got cookies, after all.	It was late, and I was as tired as I was giddy from what just happened. So much so that I realized I hadnt even opened the locket.	My fingers were trembling as I rotated it in my hands once more, finding the clasp. It snapped open in a split second and I swear I smelled cinnamon and orange as soon as it did. Inside was a small picture of who I clearly recognized as my grandmother, as well as a young man and a woman--who was holding a small baby, no older than a few weeks old. Mom and Dad?	The trembling spread though my whole body as I found myself suddenly crying. I wiped my eyes. The tears blurred my vision but all I wanted to do was stare at this photo and this locket forever. I slept on the floor of the living room that night. The glow of the Christmas tree was comforting and I felt as though I were being hugged all night. I was warm as the snow fell outside. I was happy and felt loved though I was the loneliest I had ever been.	The first sight of the sunrise woke me and I panicked searching for the locket. Did I dream that? I had to have dreamt that. But I didnt believe it.	I found composure when I felt the cold metal of the locket against my skin underneath my sweatshirt. Looking at the picture again, I smiled the most I probably ever did. I stood up and walked to the kitchen. I put my dishes from last night in the sink and filled the tea kettle to heat up. I dropped a tea bag into a new cup and realized that maybe I wasnt too old for Santa to think of me.	Next year, Ill put out the oats. I promise."
Grampa Owl and Grandfather Mouse,"My father told me of the great massacre of Summer, 2020. Randolfs grandfather began.		Randolf looked over at his twelve siblings, they were all spitting images of Randolf- wee ash grey mice squatting comfortably like furry little pom-poms.All twenty-four of their shiny black bead eyes were wide with raptness, Randolf joined them in their gaze towards the elderly, somewhat scruffy mouse with one torn ear and a kink in his tail.		Grandfather mouse continued when he had all thirteen childrens attention in full, he savored the dramatic pause, the flickering of the fire in the glowing hearth added dramatic shadows to the burrow walls.		He said, Yes, the summer of 2020.Like you little ones, I too, had had twelve siblings. We lived in a hollowed-out log that was part of the Johnsons cabin.They started out as just a couple, the cabin their vacation home.They came in the winter to do maintenance on the place, and at least once in the fall.Sometimes they spent whole summers, sometimes just the weekends in the spring.The human female was Rosie, her husband was Frank---""		Serafina said, How did you find enough food to eat?		Grandfather said, Since they did not live there year-round, my siblings and I were taught to value every crumb dropped, and every cake left unattended.We stored enough during the visits to last us when the pantry contained only cans.		There was a collective grrrr amongst the wee mice.Cans were mean.		The couple had a baby.And we feasted on a flood of tasty droppings.The pantry was stocked with cereals and jars small enough to be pushed from shelves.		Watch out for glass slivers! Exclaimed Randolf.		Thats right Randy, youve learned well ummmm, where was I?		You were about to get to the part about the stinky man.Said Serafina.		Randolf added, Yeah, the mean, rotten, crazy one!		Ah yes		There was a neighbor, through the woods, about an acre away.He lived in the woods all year round.The neighbor was a slob and a hoarder, his yard full of trash bags and Amazon boxes.The man smelled of pee and stink and crazy.The place would have been great for foraging except there were millions of rats, big mean ones.The rapt grandchildren mice inhaled as one.Rats were mean bullies, and cannibalistic.The mice shivered.		The stinky man got a dog to catch the rats.A young, big black lab.The man starved the dog so it would be hungry enough to eat the rats.It grew thinner and thinner, tied to a rope outside, never inside was it allowed.It did indeed grow so hungry that it had to catch and eat rats---		Millicent squeaked, Grampa, I thought dogs were mans best friend.To be spoiled and cared for and loved		Yes, sweetheart, but you see, the stinky man was not right in the head.That poor pup deserved so much better.I started going over there daily.Not to forage, there were still too many rats guarding the loot, but to check on the dog.He had bald patches where fleas had wreaked havoc, his eyes oozed with infection, and his dull coat was like plastic wrap over pointy, knobby bones.		Randolfs sisters wiped their eyes.		One day, the poor dog could barely lift its head.Hed given up waiting for a kind word or a loving hand.His depression roiled off his emaciated body in sickly waves.I had to do something.		I crept through the littered weeds as quietly as I could, to the dog.He looked up at me, but I wasnt afraid.After all the abuse, I saw kindness, still, in his glazed over, sad eyes.		What did you do Grampa? asked William.		What any decent creature would.I chewed the rope.It was thick, but it was rotting too, from being outside and all.When the dog was free, I led him away from the fetid yard.He followed me to Frank and Rosies cabin.The couple were appalled at the poor pups condition.		Frank had said, 		Rosie had sobbed and said, 		Frank had said, 				Frank, Rosie, and the baby, named Josephine, took the dog to the towns vet.		The next day some men went to the stinky mans house and took him away.The dog was brought back to the cabin.My word!He did not even look like the same pathetic creature from just two days earlier!His coat was shiny, silky black and his wonderful kind eyes clear.He had steak for supper that night and even given a name.Jagger, named after some rock star, I believe.		Sherry said, The Rolling Stones!Thats the band Rosie listens to when shes baking those yummy peanut butter cookies.		All the wee mice went Mmmmmmmmmm.		Grandfather Mouse continued, All was good.Everyone in the cabin was happy and healthy.	Then, in the middle of summer, Frank built a barn.A great big thing.You see, the couple were talking of moving into the cabin full time.Rosie was offered a teaching job at the elementary school, and Frank was going to restore old classic cars.Hed continue writing in his spare time.		The barn was rough wood boards, sturdy, and well insulated from the humidity and wet winter weather.It was his workshop, four cars at a time would fit under its high, vaulted roof.There were windows high under the eaves, to let in sunshine.		All was well, the change in plans was a win-win for all, including us mice.Tasty droppings all year round. And dog kibblenot as good as chocolate cake, but nutritious.		Ew, I dont like dog kibble. Randolf said and made a face.		Well kiddo, youd eat it if you were very hungry.		William said, I like the liver treats the best!		As do I Grandfather mouse said, Shall I go on?		All thirteen grandchildren mice squealed, Oh yes!Please!		Okayso all was well and good.Then the barn owls came.		Eight of the grandchildren mice cried, No! The other five gasped.		Oh yes.Huge pale birds with razor sharp talons and wicked curved beaks.They swooped out of thin air like silent ghosts.They were evil,  things.Sooo fast they were, by the time you saw them coming it was too late.There were two of them. Theyre eyes were huge and rimmed with fire, nothing escaped their searching, keen, eyeballs.The eyes of devils.		Early in the day, my mother and father went out to the yard.They never came back.Later we got thirsty, our parents werent coming home, ever.So, eight of my brothers and I fetched some fresh puddle water from the dripping garden hose.I happened to look behind us and saw a shadow gliding over the yard, coming our way.I said, And us nine raced as fast as we could.Not fast enough.Four brothers were snatched from the right of me, the other four at the same time from my left.The owls banshee screeching nearly shattered my eardrums.		When I made it to safety, into the drainpipe against the cabin, I looked up into the sky.It was just getting dark; the two killers were pale fliers like airplanes in the purpling light.I heard my siblings death shrieks, high pitched and full of terror.Each soaring killer had two wriggling mice in each wicked claw, Desmond and Dewey were pierced through their bellies but still screaming.The nasty claws were dripping with my familys blood. The owls were laughing as they flew into the barn.It had been madness we now call the Season of Slaughter. Only my sister Sophie and I were left of our big happy family.		Grandfather, we wont be able to sleep now. Said Randolf.		Grandfather Mouse said, Go have your Granny Sophie make you some warm milk.***		High in the rafters, in the nest of twigs and grass and soft green moss, an old barn owl with cataracts in his eyes and sparse tailfeathers sat on dry, cracked feet.Theyd once been a healthy supple yellow, but with age had turned brown.His head nodded down to his chest as his large golden eyes slid closed.		Grampa, Grampa!Wake up!You have to finish the story! Cried a fluffball baby owl the color of cappuccino and milk.		Yes, yes CaplanIm awake, just resting my tired ole eyes.Where was I?		Just getting to the Feast of August! cried wee Caplan, his heart shaped face eager for the climax of the story.His eyes glittered with youth and joy.		Ah yes yes, the feast.Let me seewell, your parents had just been born, they were our only owlet kids.They were voracious.Always had their beaks open the minute we came in through the window or big barn doors.		Caplan looked down at the big double doors, nearly the entire front wall disappeared when they were both open.They had to be big, all those old cars had to fit through them.The human male, Frank, did not park under the nest.Simon felt badly for him but when you gotta go, you gotta go.		Grampa Owl continued, The day started out fine indeed.We caught two of those stupid little mice, they live in the wall in the cabin and come outside to fetch water.They are dumb, but very fast---		And delicious!		Yes yes, mighty tasty, always been a favorite of mine.Anyways, we snatched up two of them.They were older mice, a little tougher than the young ones, must have been the parents.We figured that was it for the day.Then lo and behold, nine in the yard!Fetching water.I suppose theyd gotten so thirsty when their parents didnt bring any home that morning.		Caplan nodded vigorously, his mouth was watering, his shiny eyes glowing luminescent amber.		Yes yes, so, there they were.Down by the garden hose, drinking from the puddle under it.Your grandma and I were quiet as kites, soaring in the twilight sky.We flew into the stars where the mice couldnt see us, but we could see them.Oh yes yes, those were the days.We could see for miles around---		And even tiny mice far on the ground below		Yes yes, our famously great eyesight runs in the family.So, there they were just lollygagging aboutwhen suddenly, the one in the middle looks up and behind him.He spotted us and screamed.Then they ran for the cabin as fast as they could.They nearly got away, but I tucked in my wings like a bomber plane, and dove.Your Granma Elsa did the same.We were dropping to the earth at a million miles an hour!		Just atop those plump little mice, we spread our wings and soared back upeach with two mice in each claw.		Wow.Thats so cool.Eleven in one day.Eight at one time is legendary!***		Franks honey colored workbench top was warm and polished by years of hand rubbed care and cleaning with an oily wood polish.It was scarred and chipped and smelled of the citrusy solution.A row of six red metal toolboxes lined the wall behind the bench.There were mugs and a collection of vintage steins holding paintbrushes and drafting pencils and small office tools.		 Thought the barn owl as it landed clumsily on the smooth cement floor.		The old barn owl hobbled over to where the old mouse sat, nibbling a tiny crumb from Franks lunchtime sandwich.It was yellow with mustard and smelled of ham.		The mouse looked up and said, I heard you telling your grandkid about the Season of Slaughter---		Ha ha, you mean the  of August.		Whatever.		Arent you afraid Ill eat you now?		You wont get the chance.		The old owl was crumply with age, his bones creaky with arthritis.But he still believed mice were stupid.He lunged towards the old, nearly white mouse.The mouse was as old as the owl but had always been faster on the ground, he scootched backwards in a blur as the huge black dog caught the owl in his frosty colored jaws.		High in the rafters, a young barn owl screeched in distress."
Summoned,"Tom said, Thank you. He shook his head. No. Not sarcastic. How do I make it sincere? I thank you! He stamped his foot. To what can I Keep it simple. How can I thank you? Too tentative. Mean it. Im honored He hissed in frustration. This is a one shot deal. Thank YOU. THANK you. THANK YOU No! No! He stopped walking and looked about. The road stretched for miles. Tom Legato couldnt afford transportation. He walked alone. He was a simple cat.  The occasional carriage rattled by, stirring up dust and making Tom sneeze.  he thought. He called out, Im summoned by the king! Youll respect me then! He would have shaken his fist at them, if he had one. He moved his paw, as if to scratch the receding carriage. It wasnt the same. Living by his wits, he had little to show for his efforts. But thats not to say he wasnt smart. Did any cat rest on the fortune he acquired? For most, it is paw to mouth subsistence. Cats dont hoard. They have little use for savings accounts.  Called by the king, Tom could not refuse. The letter included an invitation for the banquet planned in his honor.  Tom felt unworthy of any credit. Hed never accomplished anything. Let alone anything good.  Even a discount coupon at Walts Fish House, from the king, would have incalculable value. He couldnt use it. Its worth would surpass the best market catfish. Tom shook his head as if awakening from a dream. He shuddered,  But he was an empty vessel.  A cat may have only his dignity, but he holds that dear.But the king called him. Tom had a letter, bearing the kings signet, his signature and seal. He would present it to the guard at the castle gate. Theyd take him seriously. Then everyone would see what happened.And he couldnt be late. It wont do to keep the king waiting. Tom walked. Dawdling wouldnt hasten the journey.Tom approached a bridge over the river.  he thought.A scream followed by a splash, drew his attention. Jumping atop the wall, he saw a young man floundering. Obviously unable to swim, he bobbed away in the swift current. Tom scampered downstream and onto a Sycamore branch leaning over the river. Taking a firm grip, Tom lowered himself over the water. Hey! You! Grab my tail! Save yourself!The youth responded. He lunged and grabbed Toms tail before the rapids carried him off. Pain surged through Tom as the strain almost pulled him loose. Hold on!Paw over paw, working his way toward the shore, Tom sunk his claws deep into the bark. Soon the young man felt the sand beneath his feet and released Toms tail. He splashed ashore and knelt in the mud to catch his breath. Tom pulled himself up, made his way to dry land and stood by. The man saw Tom and let out a huge sigh. You saved me! How can I ever thank you?Youd have done the same for me, if you had a tail. They laughed. Were the current any stronger, youd have had mine.He stood and bowed. Im Oliver. At your service.Tom introduced himself and showed Oliver the kings summons. Oliver read it carefully. Wow! The king is entrusting you with the Order of the Felon?Thats feline, dolt! Feline!Right. Of course Sorry.Tom said, Since youre wet, and Im hungry, catch us a snack?Oliver nodded but hesitated. You about pulled my tail off. Provide sustenance. Or you druthers be bait?Im cold.Tom rolled his eyes. Make a fire. Ill see to it.Chastened, Oliver prepared a fire. Soon, Tom returned. Catfish!While they ate, Tom explained his quandary. How does one show appreciation for a gift? From a king, no less. Its unearned favor. Cant buy it. Cant earn it. Im a cat, completely, utterly unworthy. Attempting to pay, by any means, for the recognition, is a fools errand. Would I insult the king? But for what will I be recognized? What distinguishes me from any other cat?Oliver nodded and wiped his mouth.I need to express the obligatory thank you, without sounding obsequious, do you follow?Do you have any salt?Tom ignored him. I must tell the king hes mistaken. But how does anyone, let alone a cat, correct a king? Kings dont suffer fools. How will he respond to an impertinent cat? Sounds like a formula for unthinkable punishments. Valet for a mischief of rats, or worse.Tom pushed his dinner away and stood.We must be on. The sun sinks. Arrive by nightfall, or never. Perhaps youll lend me a perch on your shoulder?Oliver hoisted Tom up and they left. The cat continued his musings. I can see the headlines.  Already, a non-entity, Ill become persona non grata. The best known nobody in the kingdom. Other cats would stiffen their tails at me. In no alley in the kingdom, could I twitch my whiskers. Oliver chuckled, Rats would blow raspberries at you. Tom refused to acknowledge the thought. I see no way out of this. How can I respond worthily?Oliver said, Worthily? Meaning?Desiring worth Sincerely willing, but lacking that virtue acting as ifOliver nodded.Can one undo his meagre worthiness? Is cultivating unworthiness ever a useful strategy?Oliver pointed. The castle loomed in the distance. A flock of sheep grazed on a hillside.I see it. Yes. Dont interrupt. Would the king think me prideful, for contradicting him?I dont thinkFor instance, would the gift be forthcoming were I a lion? Or would I then be even less worthy? Tom laughed. Thats absurd. How can I be worth less than I am now? Oliver said, A lion might feel merit in his own abilities, whereas you have none. Yes! Over some puffed up lion, the king honors me for my very lack of worth. Lions trip over inflated egos.Ah, I seeTom said, I have neither ability nor nobility. What a fine loser! Oliver chuckled. I am the epitome of unworthiness. Ive scaled the heights of mediocrity.Oliver laughed. Congratulations! Worthlessness is your virtue!Yes! Hallelujah! Make haste!Oliver stopped. A wolf slunk across the road, toward the grazing flock. Tom said, I see it. He jumped down and turned to Oliver. Try to keep up. At that, he dashed into the brush. The wolf ran fast and Oliver fell behind. He entered a clearing and saw the wolf skulking toward a solitary lamb backed into a thicket. Silence followed its plaintive bleat. It cowered as the wolf inched forward, teeth bared. Its muscles tensed, preparing to leap. The wolf howled in pain. Spinning convulsively, it appeared to chase his tail. Oliver spotted the cat clinging to the wolfs neck, safe from its snapping jaws. Tom had pounced from a tree branch as the wolf prepared its attack. Tom dug his claws securely. He held fast against the wolfs frothing attempts to shake him loose. Finally, whimpering, it sunk to the ground with its paws over its eyes. He whispered to the wolf, Youre done here. Leave the lamb. Get packing. Now! The wolf groaned in submission. Tom leaped from its back. It ran away howling. The lamb bleated. Tom called out. Take the lamb, Oliver. Were late.Oliver slung the lamb over his shoulder. They returned it to the flock. The shepherd ran over. Oliver set the lamb down and it bounded to him. The shepherd called out, Thanks guys!Tom leaped onto Olivers shoulder and they ran to the castle. At the gate, Tom produced the kings summons for the guard.Welcome! Weve been expecting you, Tom Legato.A lady-in-waiting escorted them to the banquet hall. Immense double doors swung open to reveal a lavishly decorated, main ballroom. Tom nudged Oliver and pointed to the buffet displaying every variety of fish. As they approached, the king stood in greeting. They each bowed to him. An attendant stood by holding a pillow with a medal and ribbon for the king.As the king placed the ribbon over Toms head, he said, Tom Legato, I hear-by present you with this medallion. I welcome you, an official member of the Royal Order of the Felon I mean Feline. The Royal Order of the Feline Sorry.The sound of light laughter spread through the gathered throng. Tom bowed his head. Majesty, call me anything you please. Im happy to be here. Thank you.Everyone applauded. The king smiled at Oliver. Im told you rescued a royal lamb from the fangs of a vicious wolf. He tried to clarify, but Tom snapped him with his tail. Collecting his thoughts Oliver said, Your Majesty, I do what I can. Not seeking prizes, but to explore my capabilities. What do we live for, after all, if not to make each others life better?Even the king applauded that.The king continued. I salute your unprecedented bravery, Oliver. At my beautiful daughter, Princess Erins request, I offer you her hand in marriage.Everyone cheered.Speechless, Oliver smiled at Princess Erin. She offered her hand and he kissed it.The orchestra played a lively song and the betrothed danced their first dance. Everyone joined them. Oliver and Erin soon wed. Tom Legato took and easily filled the role of the Kings Official Cat. He spent happy days dispatching any vermin daring to cross the castles threshold. They all lived happily ever after."
"Gunther, Son of Krampus","Gunther smiled at the pretty she-elf and offered her his ginger snap cookie.Her clear blue eyes grew round as ping pong balls, the silver bells on her pointed red hat tinkled as she trembled, and her pouty rosebud lips quivered.At last, she let out a scream so high pitched and supersonic, it caused a small avalanche a mile away.Her breath was peppermint and vanilla cake.She swatted the cookie into the snow and ran towards her friends that had stopped their birdlike chattering to stare at Gunther in horror.He looked sadly down at the broken cookie.Thanks a lot, he mumbled under his breath.His silvery-grey horns felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds.They did not, they were small, and only just starting to corkscrew, like the impressive one-and-a-half foot horns of his father, the Krampus.His goat shaped face was dark with a soft coating of grey fur.Someday it would be black, shaggy, bearded and warm.Gunthers hair was only shoulder length and not thick enough to keep him warm in the below freezing atmosphere, so he wore a long wool cap, with holes for his growing horns.He had asked his mother for a red cap, but she had made it black.Just like all his other clothes.The only thing he had in common with the elves were his long-pointed earsexcept, his were covered in black fur.He sighed.When he opened his mouth, his long red tongue uncurled to his navel.He bent and licked the sugar-coated cookie bits like a devilish anteater.The group of four pretty elves laughed and pointed, and soon all the elves in the playground joined in.The bell rang, Gunther waited until all the elves were inside the school.He plodded through the snow on woolly black goat legs, his black hooves dragging.He was lonely.He slunk into his seat in the back of the classroom.The teacher was an elderly elf in a long red wool dress with white hair cut into a bob.She came to him, peering over silver wire-framed pince-nez, with hands on her narrow hips, Gunther!Did you smile at Penelope?He nodded.Look at me when Im speaking to you, young demon.Gunther looked up.His strange black eyes had red irises.Miz Poppinsmith involuntarily took a step back.She said, Oh Gunther, you are truly scary to behold.When you smile, birds fall dead from the trees of heart attacks, and black bears turn white.Please refrain from frightening the other children.After school, Gunther walked home alone as usual.At least Christmas vacation started the next day.His mother, a good witch of exceptional beauty,detected immediately the sadness in her son.She bent to hug him, her long, honey-colored hair brushed his face, it smelled of pine and lemons.She kissed his cheek and offered him a warm sausage popover, fresh from the oven.Her pale oval face was flushed at her high cheekbones, her full red lips smiled.The only inhuman thing about her were her eyes.They were as big as doe eyes, but solid black as onyx.She had given up her Nordic blue ones as a dowry to Gunthers Grandpa Mephisto.Gunther didnt want to talk about school because there was nothing he could do about his growing frustration.Besides, his parents loved that he was scary.The longer his pointy white teeth grew, the broader his spine-chilling grin.Is Uncle Santa coming for supper? He asked before Yursa could enquire about his abnormally long face.Sausage popovers were Santas favorite.Yes, my sweet.Uncle Santa is bringing your father the naughty list. Santa Klaus and Gunthers dad, the Krampus, had been childhood friends who grew up and into their stations in life, each one helping the other.Uncle Santa rewarded good children with gifts and treats, Krampus beat the naughty with sticks.It was only a rumor that he sent them to Hell, Grandpa Mephisto would prefer the little monsters grow up in the world to be big monsters.The rumor that his dad sometimes ate the bad children was unfortunately true.But only the ones Yursa divined would grow to become psychotic, depraved killers or torturers of innocent, kind animals.Hes early. Said Gunther.Apparently there is a sweet creature in danger at the hands of very bad children up north, between Sweden and Iceland.The Vikings again?Yes dear.Dad will be pleased.Gunther heard stories of the Viking children.They were encouraged to torture and slaughter and steal from the Europeans that had worked hard for their farms and lands and belongings.Santa and Krampus sat by the fire, smoking after dinner pipes that smelled of sweet cloves and burnt leather.They sipped amber cognac from cut crystal glasses.Yursa reverently placed her crystal ball on the polished cedar table in their center.Gunther sat at the kitchen table, pretending to read a storybook.He peaked surreptitiously through his shaggy, black bangs, at the adults staring into the glass sphere.Fromm where he sat, he could see whisps of swirling milkiness and the spangles of city lights or stars.Krampus called over to his son, Gunther, youre old enough to help your old man this year.Gunther looked up, startled. Really Dad?He smiled broadly.His mother beamed at him, so proud.His furry ears perked straight up and vibrated like tuning forks.Yes, while I am punishing the wickeds, you will have a job, an important one, for multiple reasons.Yursa said, Come Gunther, look into the ball.Gunther gracefully pranced over, his hooves tappity-tapped on the wood floor and thumped softly over the wool rug.Yursa pointed into the ball and before his eyes, the celestial scene parted, the shimmering mist swirled away, and he looked upon a terrible scene.A group of four leather clad children, in tall boots and vests and hooded jackets, screamed and waved spears in the air.Some held dully glinting knives, and spears tipped with iron points.Their eyes were cruel shards of pale glass.The scene widened as if the viewer were pulled upwards like a kite, hovering over the yard.The yard was fenced with tall, cuspated logs, the ground was begrimed with a slushy mix of snow and mud as dirty as the young faces.On closer inspection, Gunther saw spatters and pools of red in the composition.It was not the blood of the children, however.They were not fighting each other.They were torturing a great white bear.Gunther looked up at his mother with tears in his red and black eyes.Santa sniffed, then blew his nose into his handkerchief.Yursa nodded and said, Bear baiting.Cruel and inhumane.The children are encouraged by their parents to participate in such so-called sport, they feel it readies them for war.Gives them a taste for cruelty and blood.Gunther said, But they are hurting those dogs too.Krampus said, Yes son.They make the bear bleed.The dogs are trained to respond to the sight and smell of blood, they encourage them to attack the bear, making wagers.Dont the children get hurt? Or Killed?Yursa said, If they do, the adults say that it was the will of Odin, their king of gods.Krampus said, Hmf!Theyll wish they were dead when they get a load of me.When can we go, Dad?Ill take you there tomorrow.Said Santa.***Under an overcast sky, high above icy white lands they flew.Four enormous, shaggy white and pale tan reindeer galloped through the air, leading the green and gold sleigh- silent, but for the  of their mighty lungs.Great white puffs from their snouts dissipated rapidly into the frigid air of their wake.Santa was bundled in a thick, soft woolen coat the color of dry moss.It was lined with thick, warm beige fur that rippled in the fast wind.His hat was matching.Krampus wore no hat, only a black woollen cloak, his thick ebony fur undulated and whipped briskly behind him.The eastern sky was the color of a nasty bruise. The west would soon follow.Gunther wore his warmest fur lined hat, pulled down tight against his head, he had belted his coat as tightly as he could but shivered as frozen drafts crept into his sleeves and under his muffler.His eyes watered, though the sleigh featured a framed glass windshield.The bleached land below was spotted with deep green patches of forests as mysterious as precious emeralds.Great slabs of sienna-grey rock edged fast moving rivers.On the horizon faint ashy wisps rose against the gloomy, overcast sky.Smoke.As they neared their destination, the smoke grew thicker and sootier.The sounds of shouts and laughter and orders ululated up to them in the winds, like vampire bats.Santa called over the roar of the wind in their ears, Down there!In those woods by that stream! We rest until just before dark, thats when they close the gates for the night.The settlement is just over that rise.!Over the hill, smoke from multiple vents and cookfires amassed and mingled with the dark grey clouds.They set up camp and let the reindeer rest, Santa gave them each a bucket of oats.The woods were dense and protected from the harsh wind, the three-sided lean-to was relatively warm after a fire was built.They ate bread and cheese and dried herring.At four oclock the sun would set.So, at three, Gunther and his father took off at a fast pace. Krampus carried his whipping switches in a wicker basket slung over his back. Their long goat legs gracefully leapt through the snow and Gunther realized that that was what they were made for.They made the distance in only ten minutes.Outside the gate, Gunther said, How do we get inside without being seen?Ah my son, with this, His father pulled a shimmering black cloak from his basket. It rippled in the air like silk.Gunther frowned.Krampus unfolded it with a flick of his long fingered, black gloved hand, and draped it over his head and around his shoulders.He was gone.Gunther gasped.His mother had told him about the spelled cloak when he was little.He swelled with pride at her talents as his father enveloped them both.They walked through the gates.The dirty, muddy yard was devoid of life.Suppertime. Whispered Krampus.Gunther nodded against his fathers wool covered belly.They tip-toed along the yard, staying close to the fence, stepping onto frozen mud when they could.When they stepped in snow, hoofprints appeared like magic.Any prints they made would only look like the prints of the Vikings livestock.Raucous laughter from the communal longhouse indicated a meal in session.Across the yard behind them, the huge wooden gates scraped closed, A thick iron bar clanged and clanked into metal brackets.There were six other longhouses in the settlement, the boisterous, occupied one in the center.Suddenly a dog barked.It sounded confused. The pair under the invisible cloak froze.The men who had closed the gate shouted to it.The dog continued in a frantic manner.Then a Quit it! in Old Norse. Then a  and a sharp yip.Then quiet.They continued surveying the yard.Gunther nudged his father and whispered, There.He pointed between the next two long wooden homes.In the yard between was the bear.It looked dead.Gunther growled low in his throat.The bears ears twitched.It lifted its great head and sniffed the air, staring straight at Krampus and Gunther.It whined sadly and lay back down but kept its eyes on the cloaked pair.It sees us.Whispered Gunther.Bears are highly sensitive to magic.His father whispered back.Off you go.He whisked the cloak off his son and Gunther went cautiously yet eagerly to the bear.Krampus leapt away towards the house where the children would be leaving from shortly.He crouched in anticipation and soon heard childrens voices approaching.The youngest would be headed to bed first.Out the door came three little towheads, hair nearly white and tousled like baby chicken feathers.They were very young- wobbly little toddlers, with a mother or maiden-slave in tow.These three were still innocent, theyd not been in the cruel crowd of baiters.Krampus eased back to let them pass.Within seconds, another pair emerged.Older, and with those cold grey-blue eyes hed seen in the vision.He waited until they passed, then followed.He whisked off the cloak, letting it drape off his back.He followed the boys with heavy feet.They heard and turned as one.Krampus grinned.He was a terrifying black horned silhouette, with glistening white teeth from ear to ear.Lightning fast he clamped iron collars around their pale throats before they could scream.The collars rendered them paralyzed. Into the basket they went.He re-cloaked and waited for the others like a trap-door spider.The next two were very small girls.They were innocent, he let them pass.A taller, third girl strode out the door like a Valkyrie in training, he recognized her from the vision.He swooped her up like a vampire and disappeared like black smoke into the night.One left.Krampus waited as a wetnurse exited with a squallering wee babe in her arms.Then came the boy he sought.He was with a stocky, scruffy young man who could only be his father.He followed.The man stopped and turned, his eyes squinting into the shadows.He shook his head.The insolent boy at his side said in Old Norse, There is nothing.You drank too much.The father swatted the boys head with a ham haunch fist and belched.They walked on.At the closest longhouse, the father shoved the boy towards the door and said, I need to make water.Go on in.The boy went into the home, the man went to the sanitation ditch that ran behind the homes.Krampus followed the boy.Once inside, he removed the cloak and loomed over the boy.The second he turned around the collar silenced him.Into the basket he went.As Krampus took the children into a barn, a lantern flared to life.The horses nickered softly but were not alarmed.Animals were kindred spirits.Krampus and his kin in fact, smelled of the pleasant musky, grassy scent of buffaloes.One by one Krampus whipped the bad children with his switches.Each one he beat until the stick broke.The childrens mouths stretched into ovals in their reddened faces. Their eyes streamed; their jaws creaked.The horses eyes glowed red in the soft light, the four children would forever be afraid of them.When their backs and behinds were striped bloody red, Krampus said in their Norse tongue, Kill each other all you like, I care not. But lay a finger in cruelty upon any animal for sport and you will pay.Scream now, and Ill re-double the beating. He removed the collars and turned to sooty smoke, whisked out the door by a wind.He found Gunther and the bear at the open gate.Krampus looked at his son with eyebrows raised.Gunther said, The bear, her name is Ingbrod, she did it.Shes very weak but is desperate to help us.Santa called out from the other side, Over here!Krampus, Gunther, and Ingbrod went to the sleigh, not bothering to close the gate.As the reindeer flew up into the air, tiny yellow stars flickered from the sled blades.They looked down at the receding Viking settlement.Men and women chaotically ran from the main lodge, shouting frantically, as their horses, oxen, and other livestock galloped out the open gate.Santa laughed, Ho ho ho ho ho!Krampus laughed along with him.Gunther sat in the back of the sled with his arms around Ingbrod.Shed lost a lot of blood and her oozing, open wounds were festering.Her dirty coat was matted, and she smelled of sickness and death.He said into her huge, soft ear, Please dont leave us. I  you.You are special.They flew west, under stars, above the clouds.As they reached the Krampus home high in the Alps, clouds parted before them like shimmering heavenly gates.Yursa ran outimmediately and helped her son and husband bring the bear inside while Santa took care of his reindeer.Gunther, for the tenth time started, Mom, is she---Hush child!We just must wait.I do not know.She was at deaths door.Her heart was barely thumping.I cannot stop the reaper.Gunther went outside and howled at the moon.Wolves mournfully commiserated.***On the first day of school after the Christmas holidays, Miz Poppinsmith stood in front of the class and asked them,Has any one seen Gunther? His desk was empty.The elf children looked around guiltily.Penny Weebottom said, Well we dont really hang out with him.Bobby Farther said, Hes kinda scary.Miz Poppinsmith said, Class.I understand.But has he not always been kind to you all?And hasnt he tried to make friends despite his obvious scary differences?The wee elves nodded.Cheery Mayweather, who sat by the window, suddenly jumped up and pointed out of it.She said, Look!All the elves squeezed onto the windowsills.There was Gunther, the strange, creepy kid in black, riding on the back of a ginormous, shaggy, glistening white polar bear!He wore no cap, his long, shaggy black hair wafted behind him.As he approached the school, the elves ran outside.As the wee elf children stared in wonder at the mountain of a bear before them, Gunther grinned.It was still pretty frightening, but, shuddering, the elves grinned back."
The Thanks I never Gave,"I lay awoken, just before the dawn of the day rises from its comfortable corners, my gaze fixed on the bedrooms ceiling for what it felt like an eternity. My name is Alexander Cornway and I have a problem. A tremendous, paramount of a problem. In just a few very short hours, I will have to get out of this bed and stare at the woman slumbering beside me. As she always does every single morning, she will yawn as loud as she can be---on purpose may I add, normally I would be asleep by that time, so she will place her corpse like hands on my back with a grin on her visage, I, as intolerant to the cold as I always have been, will bend my body in a number of ways, fighting back the shock to my system that my dear old wife loves to inflict on me. If Im brutally honest, I will paint my face with this look of annoyance and irritation, blabbering some sort of witty remark, when in reality, I simply adore the fact that she kept that childish nature instill within her, even into adulthood. When that time comes, I will have to face the previously mentioned problem. The problem at hand being that in the ten long years after I married her, even to this very second, I still love her. And Im not talking about the---I love her as my friend, or companion that Ive lived with for such and such years and she has become a nice person to be around with---no, no, no. I still desire her! I yearn for her! I still find myself fantasizing--dreaming even about her when shes not even around. I envy my own past self, because he will get to experience the emotional rollercoaster that it was to meet her, date her, and eventually marry her. I truly love her, and I never knew how to say it. How to verbally express my own thoughts and feelings to her--- and dont get me wrong here, she knew all these things since the very beginning of our romance. She knew everything about me really, my wants, my desires, my hopes and dreams, what I hate, what I love and what I cherish. What Im trying to say is, she knows me---and I just wish I could just let her know how grateful I am to her. Thats the very reason on why my eyes creep at the darkness of the room, why I cant seem to catch the sweet nectar of slumber. How lucky I am to ever have a wonderful woman like her, and where would I be if I never wouldve met her? Those two questions have been revolving around my head constantly this night---every night to be honest, and although they are easy to answer, I cant hope but ponder about them. She is a deem light beaming down the darkest of caverns, she is the lighthouse that guides the ships away from sinking to the bottom of the sea. She is my light, and only second to one, she is everything in my life---apart from the brat sleeping on the room next to ours, that is I will never love anyone as I love her, and I realize that as long as I keep her memories close to my heart, I will keep her close to me---always. The clock clicks, and time slowly flows, I now turned my gaze towards her side of the bed, my body slightly shifting to my side. I cant say that she ever slept like an angel Her loud snores and random moans that render you awake, were more than enough to scratch that thought out of your head, yet her silver hair that comfortably rested on the whiten pillow could easily make me think otherwise. Maybe she was an angel sent from above to bless me on behalf of my creator? But If that was the case why? Why put me in this position? Why make me lay awake at night, embracing the bedsheets covers? Her side of the bed is still warm, even though she was always cold to the touch I guess I do know the answer to these questions.The rays of the rising sun began to slither in between the gaps of the window shades. My eyes remained closed, as a sudden change of the bed became abundant enough for me to notice. I felt her hands intertwine around my chest, embracing me. I can smell the lilac lavender coming from her silver hair as it landed on the side of my cheek. I cant hope but to feel my heart as it began to race, fast as jet breaking the sound barrier, I smile as I know this wont last too long. Morning is just around the corner, and I know Im going to have to wake up soon. Yes. I realize, I have been sleeping this whole time. Its not my first time having this kind of dream, and God, I just wish it would last longer Tears begin to be welled under my eyes, as I smile pleasantly at this whole ordeal.I love you, Eli. Im sorry I wasnt there for you in the end. Im sorry, I never got to---Daddy! roared an innocent voice. A sweet melody bellowed around the room, as the wooden barrier that made the door, slammed open. Daddy! Are you awake, yet? Silver locks of hair bounce with each step, as the little girl made her way inside her parents room. Hey, kiddo. What are you doing here so early? I groaned, adjusting myself into a seating position, I extended my arms wide to act as a landing platform for the incoming rocket of love that headed my way. The little bundle of love launched herself into her fathers arms, a wide grin on her visage complemented her hazel eyes and the beauty mark on her lower left cheek. God, every day you look more and more like your mother. I said, as a warm smile paint itself on my face, Youre growing too fast! She wrapped her arms around my neck, turning them into a strong lock, I swing her from left to right in a playful manner, ultimately placing her to my side.Daddy. Rachel asks.yes, pumpkin? Who were you talking too?What do you mean?Earlier daddy, before I came in, you said were saying. Im sorry a lot. Ah, it was nothing, kiddo. I was just dreaming. Rachel stared at her father, deep in his eyes. Who did you dream about?Oh, just someone who, I shouldve said Thank you too."
"Cacophony, New York City, Three AM","The first time she heard the noise, it was 3:18 in the morning. Shed been awake, sweating under the too-warm duvet until around three, and had just sunk into the first few moments of heavy welcome sleep, when the sound came down from the ceiling and torpedoed the early stages of her REM cycle.A mans voice, shaky and thin, yet piercingly loud.Who the hell was Maureen? Shed met their upstairs neighbor, an older woman named Barbara with a severe silver bob and a hairless cat. Barbara seemed to make a point of avoiding any friendly interactions with her neighbors. Theyd only spoken once, when Barbara had knocked on their door with a stack of letters and bills that had been mistakenly put in her mailbox. she had remarked crossly, as if this had been some type of conspiracy against her. Barbara lived alone, she thought. Had she moved? No, she had seen her that afternoon, taking out her trash with a grimace on her face like taking out the trash was a personal insult. Did she have a visitor over? Who was the man yelling in the middle of the night? Who was Maureen?The voice came from directly above her head, but it had a strange faraway quality, like she was hearing it underwater. The walls of their Hells Kitchen converted two-bedroom were thin, they knew that upon moving in. They could hear footsteps in the halls and the pulsing bassline of music blasted by the college kids downstairs. But they had never heard clear voices, never been able to make out words or conversations or requests.They had moved for the baby, leaving their cramped (but undeniably cool) studio in South Brooklyn for a place with more space to breathe. Unfortunately, any space they thought theyd use for breathing was immediately filled with baby toys, baby crib, baby food, baby clothes. The second bedroom was more of a glorified closet they had shoehorned into a nursery, its single window directly facing into the back of another tall brick building, offering no view and no natural lighting. The items piled up on the floor and the rooms began to close in around her. When they had announced the pregnancy, her friends with kids had told her Youll never sleep again!, their eyes twinkling with malicious joy. Was that some kind of sick joke? Theyd been right. She couldnt remember sleeping through the night, truly sleeping, a single time since the baby had been born. She must have, right? Just once? She couldnt remember.Her husband could sleep through a bomb, and she was starting to resent him. Actually, she was starting to hate him. She would look over at him next to her in the bed, the silhouetted, snoring lump, and shed let the hatred fill up her chest until it pounded against her ribs. Shed squint at him in the darkness, willing him to wake up by shooting her distilled, hardened anger at him like lasers out of her eyes. How dare he leave her to experience this alone? How dare he be able to sleep peacefully? How dare be able to sleep peacefully?When she complained to him in the morning, hed said If you were a real New Yorker, you would have banged on the ceiling with a broom until he shut up. Unfortunately, she wasnt a real New Yorker, so his advice was entirely unhelpful. She was a transplant, raised in a tiny Midwestern town founded upon steel manufacturing and etiquette.Her family had worked in processing, shipping, and distributing large-scale farming equipment at the same steel plant for the last century. Her grandfather hadnt complained when a faulty conveyor belt had trapped his left hand, leaving him down a pinky and half a ring finger, and she would absolutely be complaining about her noisy upstairs neighbors.And yet.Complaining made enemies, and making enemies went against her nature. Besides, who was to make a noise complaint? Shed only just wrenched the baby out of a reverse-cycling hellscape of nightly scream-and-feed sessions. She (the baby, but by association had been the primary cause of her neighbors sleep deprivation for the past four months, she was sure of it; what right did she have to say a single word about anyones late-night shouting?And yet.And yet, that voice. An adult voice, a man, not a baby, shouting into the sticky 3am summer air. Who the hell does he think he is?The second night, the voice was accompanied by a banging so loud and so precisely placed above her head she felt it be targeted at her.Bang! Bang!Hes trying to keep me up, she had told her husband after jostling him awake, having listened to the yelling and banging alone in the dark for half an hour. Hes trying to keep me up and its creeping me out.Its just someone sleep-talking, he said.And the banging?Sleep-walking sleep-talking, I guess.Can you do something about it?Why would I do something about it? I didnt even hear it until you woke me up. Jesus, hon, come on. Im exhausted. He rolled over to face the wall. She yelled internally at the back of his head, hoping hed receive the message psychically. He didnt get the message. He was already asleep.Bang!She spent the days walking-dead style, staggering through her list of tasks with her eyes half-shut. She just wanted to take a nap, but she couldnt nap unless the baby was also napping, and the baby wasnt supposed to nap or else he wouldnt sleep through the night. And if she was napping, she couldnt be providing the baby with (whatever that meant). Most days, proper enrichment meant plopping the baby in front of a TV show about British pigs so she could(she shouldnt be drinking coffee) Somehow, the baby now had boundless energy during the day. She was livid. For months, the baby had woken her up three, four, five times a night, leaving her to figure out if he was or or or maybe just Now, the baby slept peacefully through the night in his closet-turned-nursery while she lay awake in bed, listening to the man call out for to . She began to pray that the noise would wake the baby; at least then she would have an ally in her anger. she could confront the neighbors, march upstairs with a screaming, red-faced infant on her hip and let them have it. She couldnt make an enemy on her own, definitely not, but she could certainly channel her rage through the bawling child.Without the baby, shed be a With the baby, she was justified. She was just being a But the baby didnt seem to care about any of this. The baby didnt care about how much sleep she got, because the baby was sleeping happily through the night, waking up refreshed, and so was her husband, and she felt all the energy slowly leaking out of her.The next night the yelling was accompanied by another voice, a woman, quieter, restrained, but almost stern. Barbara? Barbara the angry cat lady? She couldnt make out the words, just the rhythm of the conversations, the hoarse, flustered shouts followed by the womans voice, serious and measured.she thought. Bang! She would get no sleep that night.She would get no sleep for the next six nights. It always started right around three, the same exact way; just as she began to think Sometimes she could make out the other voice, Barbaras voice, louder than usual, snapping at the man. Dad. Barbaras father, frail and elderly and screaming through the night. she thought. Shed surprised herself. Shed never wished death upon someone, even in her worst moments, even inside her head. But once shed thought it, she couldnt stop.On the seventh night, she lay in bed, her skin prickling with sweat from the summer heat and sweat from her rage. She hated her baby and her husband for sleeping through the night. She hated Barbara and she hated Barbaras father and she hated her bed and her apartment and its paper-thin walls and she was so, so tired.Bang!She bolted up, throwing the duvet on top of her sleeping husband who didnt move a muscle, didnt make a sound. She got out of bed and stomped down the hall, passing the nursery where the baby (somehow, miraculously, ) slept soundly. She didnt care if she woke him up, she didnt care if she woke the whole apartment up as she threw her front door open. Feeling the cold hallway tiles on her bare feet, the buzz of the fluorescent bulb lighting the 3am darkness, trudging up the stairs as she thought of what shed say, She landed in front of the apartment, raised her arm to bang on the door because she knew it would be louder than the bell. And she heard it again.Clearer now, as if there wasnt a door between them at all, as if he was right in front of her.And Barbaras voice, in response, softer now.A silence.She stood outside the door listening to the silence. All silent now. There was no more shouting, there was nothing more.After a few breathless moments, she went back downstairs, back through her door, stopping to kiss the baby on the head, to smell his warm, soft head. Her spot in the bed was gone. Her husband had rolled over in his sleep, his dense body now at the center of the mattress, arms outstretched, leaving only small cutouts of room. Shed done this many nights before, curled herself inward to fit into the negative spaces beside him.Tonight, she pulled the duvet off her husband and wrapped it around herself. He let out a single snore, then nothing. She exited the apartment wordlessly, she didnt wake him up and she didnt leave a note. She climbed the staircase, stopping in front of Barbaras apartment, still sweet-silent, then continuing on, up, up, until she got to the door marked No Entry, the door that should be alarmed but she knew wasnt. Shed been out that door before, during the daytime, when she needed room to breathe, real room to breathe, when she needed everything to still.The rooftop was empty, a flat gray slab with walls of brick just high enough that she could peek her head over the top and look out onto the buildings around her. Tonight she didnt need to look. Tonight she spread the duvet on the concrete and lay down, stretching out, taking up every corner, filling up the edges. She listened to the noises of the city below her. She listened to the rushing of late-night traffic on Tenth Avenue and the bursts of car horns, laughter, music. She listened to the rustling of leaves somewhere far away, the flaps of pigeons' wings and the whir of air conditioners set into windows. She listened to her own breath, slow, steady, deep underneath her ribs, the rushing of her blood, the pulsing of her heart.And then the heavy, ecstatic quiet of sleep."
Outside,"I dont know how long I watched myself sleep that night.My face looked different than it did in the mirror. I cant say in what way, it just did. I wondered what I was dreaming about. Probably the usual stuff. I didnt wonder why I was floating a few feet above my own body. Not for a while at least. I cant say how long.There I was, dreaming, probably about struggling to put on a pair of socks. The socks thing is a surprisingly common motif in my dreams. I never have much trouble putting them on in the waking world. I struggle with a lot of things in the waking world, just not socks.When I did realize I wasnt in my body that night, but, instead, hovering like the ghost of a person who just hadnt died yet, my first thought was about my eyes. They were open. Not fully, but kinda squinting, like I was irritated by something very far off. I knew I did this, but hadnt ever actually seen it myself. (One time my sister recorded a video of it and showed me, but thats like a mirror, it doesnt count.)The pools closed, I said, down there in bed.Pools are not a common motif in my dreams, so I felt a little left out. It was winter at the time, so I knew I didnt have a chance at going to a pool in real life. And I like pools. More than the ocean, which I cant explain.It was the pool thing that made me take my current situation more seriously. If I didnt have a body, that meant no swimming, no pools, none of it. I needed to figure out how to get back into my body because I needed it. For a lot of things. But especially pools.I pondered what the rules might be for my current situation. How to get back into my body. Was it something that happened automatically, or did I have to do it myself, before my body-self awoke from his slumber? And if it was the latter, and I didnt, would I be trapped out here forever? Or, maybe, would I get a second chance the next night? Or, worst of allcould my body even awake without its consciousness? If thats what this floating part of myself even was.I tried to move, but that turned out to be a bit of a challenge. Not having a body made it hard to know how to move because, for me, moving has always been directly tied to my physicality. Arms, legs, fingers, etcetera. I would have to do a little more strategizing.Then I realized, even though my personal experience of moving is tied directly to my physical bodyby that I mean my appendages and their movementit all starts in my brain. My brain sends signals to my appendages and then my appendages do the thing my brain thought. The thing was, at the moment, I didnt have a brain. Which seemed like a problem at first, but then I realized I was having thoughts. Thoughts independent of a brain. It made sense when I thought about it (without my brain). So, if my brain was just a conduit of my thoughtsi.e. if thoughts originated outside my physical brainand my movement was directed by thoughts sent to my brain, which, in turn, sent that movement-thought to my appendages, concluding in my movement, thenwhen you think about itthought is what causes movement, not the physical brain.I thought about moving closer to myself andthereforedid move closer to myself.I didnt like being that close to my face. There was probably some deep-seated psychological issue to be dealt with regarding that response, but, at the moment, I had to deal with other issues. Mainly, figuring out how to absorb myself back into myself.Faintly, far off, I could hear the sounds of splashing water., I thought, completely independently of my brain.Maybe that was the answer. Maybe I had to synchronize my thoughts with the dream inside my sleeping brain. Sounded as good as anything else.I closed my eyes.(I didnt actually close my eyes, I had no eyes to close, but I did my best to focus my attention on my thoughts, instead of my current visual stimulus.)I listened hard to the sounds coming from my sleeping bodys dream. I tried to imagine the pool, the people sloshing around in the blue, the smell of chlorine, the shape of the splashing waves.I imagined I was a bat, hanging there, echolocating my own minds unconscious thoughts. Andsurprising to even meit was working. I started to see things, things that I hadnt imagined, but that began to form by my resonance with the dream venting off into the metaphysical stratosphere.I stood on the edge of the pool.I stood on the diving board.I stood on the diving board and on the edge of the pool.The me on the edge of the pool was the me I had been since I fell asleep. The me on the diving board was eleven-years-old and second-guessing his choices.I had always loved pools but hated diving boards. This had always caused a tension. As a kid, if youre in a pool, you have to use the diving board or all the other kids wont let you live it down. If you tell them that you are afraid of the diving board, they will make sure to get you onto that diving board and then push you off no matter how much you struggle. Its best to just choose the diving board yourself.So this was kinda a nightmare.I wanted to tell myself that I didnt need to jump off the diving board, but I knew that wasnt true. Things had to run their course. A nightmare had to be a nightmare. I didnt know how dangerous it would be to interfere. I had made it here successfully, inside my own unconscious minda feat that seemed impossible, even in the middle of a greater impossibilityso probably best to not push it.I jumped off the diving board and made the plunge.I held my breath and waited for myself emerge from the water.I emerged from the water and swam over to the edge of the pool.Its fine, I said, spitting out a stream of chlorinated water. Its better to just take the dive.I know, I said.What are you doing here?Well, I was outside, I pointed up, vaguely, and thenHowd you get out there?No idea.Are you going to stay here?Stay I tried to understand what I was saying, I dont want to stay, here. I want to go, with you.Where am I going?I looked down at my eleven-year-old self and then came the soon-to-be-too-familar sensation"
For My Father,"Trigger warning: Suicide, mental health Some mornings the feeling was of old lace, touch it and it falls to dust. On others she saw their little rat tails disappearing under the soffits and couldnt grab even one to yank it back and see what it was. Most days it felt more like seeing cockroaches zipping away and gone before she was even sure they were there. It had been going on a long time, this disconnection from her dreams. They just did not stay long enough in her mind to even form an image. She tried all the remedies for rememberingstay still, dont open your eyes, walk backward into the scene, paper and pen under the pillow, flax and lavender eye shade, marijuana gummies, warm baths, recordings of ocean waves, sleep at odd times, mantras both poetic and mundane. But her dreams had gone AWOL. She felt stripped of a pillar of her psyche. She imagined they had all washed onto the shore of a remote Pacific atoll along with Amelia Earharts bones. Her dreams used to be the central imagining force of her mind, the source for poems, stories and a novel told in fairy tales. Now her writing had stalled out. She started to wonder if she was losing her edge. Was this a sign of early decay of some kind? Why would dreams be shutting down now, in the midst of a pandemic when she needed them most? They were her parallel life even before lockdown. In the past she had dreamed of conducting an animal orchestra, of flying from crumbling sand cliffs, of diving to the bottom of a green pool and even breathing under water until she realized she would soon drown. She looked at the surface so far above, a ceiling of light she could gauge right away was beyond her breath supply. She frantically clawed upward, losing momentum. Foolish how far she had dived down and lost track of time and distance. She had felt at peace tumbling in the depths of the warm pool, a water creature that wouldnt need to surface. Then so alarmed that she woke mid-stroke as if switching off a projector. She blinked into the pale light of her bedroom. Breathing fine, beyond grateful to be breathing. She had oversized lungs to begin with. She always won the contest for who could swim underwater the longest. Or in choir, she could hold a long note far past where everyone else had gasped to a stop. This deep-green pool in the dream had almost been the death of herin the dream anyway, and maybe in life too. But close calls like this, including frequently falling off bridges, riding in driverless cars, canoeing in 30-foot Arctic waters, trying to pull her sister from an undertow, never made her want to stop dreaming. Without dreams a whole other color palette was missing. She was an imposter in life, especially as a writer. Lots of people suggested a dream specialist or a hypnotist but she wasnt sure about entrusting this part of herself to a stranger. She had a hard enough time with regular therapy. Which was useless for bringing her dreams back anyway and posed inane questions like Why do you think this is happening? If she knew that she wouldnt have to be here. So when she saw the table at the Farmers Market with a handwritten sign, Rve-elation, she paused. She felt a long sigh move through her body. Smaller script below read dreams used and reconditioned. The chair was empty where a proprietor might sit. Was this was a self- service operation? The dark blue cloth covering the table bore jags of yellow lightning like cartoon symbols for electricitywarning that you could get a shock. It was windy but the cloth did not ruffle and the small bottles shoulder to shoulder on the table stood without teetering. All dark brown glass, closed and somber looking. Are these smelling salts, to bring on visions, she wondered, or drops to put in a hot drink before bed? Used and reconditioned, thats some joke. What does that mean? That all dreams are basically from the same factory and they just get recycled and reused? She had always prided herself on her dreamsthe unique images of purple-skinned women diving in a sea cave, the museum of bombs, the overflowing shed of papers where her long-dead father still labored. That was the one dream she longed to return to. She and her father didnt have time to begin the long task he had summoned her to. She had met him at the side of the gardenhis half-acre vegetable plot. It was in spring cover crop, how he had left it and wasnt returning to plant anymore. Made sense. He swung his gaze from the rye grass. You dont look too good. Youre so old. Where is my little girl? Speak for yourself, she thought to herself. But she said, Youve been gone more than 30 years, Dad. How can you expect me not to look old? Im nearly your age now. He said, Come here, theres a really important project you have to help me with. I want to show you. He put his baseball glove-sized hand on her shoulder where it sat nearly weightless and led her to a shed next to the garden. She could see overflowing boxes and tides of papers scattered everywhere. The work bench was completely covered, tools buried. Boxes were stacked on the rototiller, the wheelbarrow and the cart that hooked to the riding mower. On her birthdays he would give rides around the lawn in this wooden wagon until she and her brother and sister grew too big to fit. Everything was papers now, spilling over the slats. Piled invoices like layers of filo dough, cash register slips, envelopes ripped open jaggedly, file folders of brown-edged papers. Ripped, crumpled, everything mounded without organization.She could not imagine where they would begin. He said, Hurry, we dont have much time, the light is fading. There is something in here, very important, that I want to show you. We have to find it. They stood at the sheds doorway and her hands twitched to start sorting and organizingsomething she was really good at. They had to find the important document or whatever it was he wanted to show her. He had never spoken to her this way so she was especially on alert and ready to help. Not like when he would command her and her siblings to pick peas or weed the garden. She could feel there was so much to learn in there. This shed he had never showed anyone. It seemed he had built it next to where his ashes lay in the garden, sometime during the decades since he died. He had been waiting for her to find her way there in a dream. Now they were on the threshold of a great mission together. He finally trusted her with something he had never revealed in his lifetime. Was it about his brother Robbie the priest in training who died in a mental hospital? Was it about losing the farm? Was it his own private writings done in rehab? She had heard hints of these stories from her aunts but thats as far as it went. Whatever her father wanted to tell her, she was sure she would know him a little more. She longed to know him not just as the severe man who committed suicide right after Thanksgiving. He had saved all these important papers to show her. She welled up with gratitude. With so little time, how would they start? Just as she and her father were entering the shed she woke up. She could feel the huge revelation hanging, invisible, waiting to be brought to light among the papers. Then nothing. Gray windows at 6:42 am. She was furious. Maybe it was from this time onward that her dreams seemed to abandon her more and more.But if she had to choose, this was the only dream she cared to revisit. Wouldnt she and her father have gone into the shed and started to work on the piles side by side, reminiscing, sharing familiar oddities they came across--who is this in the photo, remember your green moleskin shirt? The big revelation was not within reach anymore, now that her dreams had de-coupled from her psyche and gone on a different track. These tracks had no distant point of convergencethey traveled resolutely parallel. She leaned from her window and strained to see if her father was on the other train. It faded into its own smoke. How could used and reconditioned dreams be of any help to her? She wanted to return to a very specific one, not end up with someone elses worn-out weird dream they had discarded. And what could be reconditioned? She had circled the whole farmers market barely seeing the late summer tomatoes and sweet pea bouquets with sunflowers. She had been staring inward at the papers in in the shed. When she arrived back at theRve-elation table a blocky man was seated in the folding chair, squinting from under his crocodile hat. She imagined through his black denim shirt to the tangle of tattoos over his whole body. His arms fit tightly in the shirtsleeves and she could picture a cottonmouth twining over his biceps. He adjusted his hat and twirled his cigarette out on the sole of a white boot with real fur patches left on the leather. For a man of amphibious skin he had a lot of knuckle hair. Far away on the giving and getting. She wasnt sure if thats what he said but it seemed addressed at her. Kin I help yeh? She expected to smell booze as she stepped closer. The farmers market was usually so wholesomewho was this? What de yeh fancy, pretty lady? he offered again. Promenade in green? Keys to the kingdom? High, low, rocky road? He paused. She stopped moving. I see it. You want to go. He awaits, green light on behind. Take the train, the slow train. She looked into his greeny mud-brown eyes and felt him see straight into her grief. Still, after 30 years. And now, especially after the unfinished dream and all the others lost. She longed to walk next to her father again. They wouldnt have to shuffle papers. They wouldnt even have to talk. The one about the shed, thats the dream I cant give up. All the others you can have. Enough to fill the Library of Alexandria. Maybe the trade is good. What do I fancy? Just one more afternoon with my father. I need to ask him about the shed, why he showed me all that stuff and then just left. She spilled the words and then felt like fleeing. The mans fingertips paced over the shiny black caps of his brown bottle army. His fingernails were a nauseous shade of yellow. With a click of his tongue he picked up a bottle, opened and sniffed and quickly recapped it. Too acidic. Wipes your memory. Some want that. He went back to fumbling over the neat rows of bottles. This one he held up to the light. Not enough culturing time, still cloudy. He closed his eyes and let his hand drift like a metal-detector. She wanted to pull away and get back to normal errands, but she had waited this long. His stubby fingertips closed on the neck of a bottle in the center of the collection. He lifted it slowly, dangling it down in a way she could only call unsettling. I wouldnt have said Pokeweed for youdidnt take you for a chancer. But here. Dont drink it, just put it under your pillow. She couldnt move. He murmured on in a thin voice: How many dream fires I have doused with this wicked tincture and yet some may still live in a useful form. Take special care, this is the hazmat dump of the whole collection. Once I give it to you Ill start right in on the next one. Ive got the base liquor all ready in the still maybe you saw my trailer in the parking lot, with the pipe on the side? These days I can pass for one of those teardrop camper types, just a little more rough and tumble. Been at it for some time, back to the Pleistocene you could say. You dont say, she thought. What drugs did he grow up on? He was still dangling the narrow bottle over the table between them. It had a murky orange glow that reminded her of eucalyptus honey. The more he moved it, swinging like a bell, the more it seemed to pick up moisture from the air until it was covered with a haze of condensation. Then it started to smoke like a lump of dry ice. Its all charged up, mlady. Without thinking she reached out and let him drop the bottle into her left palm. She closed her fingers on the slender smoking glass. A sting ran through her body. OK, she thought, this guy has something going here. I should probably run. He was watching her with interested wavering underwater eyes. They were the color of the deep pool where she had swum and nearly run out of breath, come to notice. He smiled with a few teeth, black gums. What do I do now? Keep it in the sun when its not under your pillow. Dont let anyone else touch it. Bring it back when it runs down for a free recharge. How will I find you? Dont worry, you will, he said, sliding his chevron eyebrows up and down. She started to feel seasick, the earth was sliding away. What if this was a bottle of jinx? Why was she still standing here? She looked around at the deserted farmers market. They were alone next to a garden and the light began to fall. How do I know I you arent trying to mess me up with this stuff? I thought thats why you stopped by, dearie. The daytime world is just a little too dry for the likes of you. I traffic in the underneath. You know it, you crave it. Youve grown out of the usual portals. I wouldnt give you Pokeweed if you werent ready. More nonsense palaver, but her hand hadnt fallen off, and the electrical current had backed off to a mild massaging purr. Her eyes felt loose in their sockets. She gave in, why not at least pretend she would try it. What do I owe you? she managed to mumble. Ill collect, youll see, he winked. She didnt remember sleeping but now she was in a little shed on wheels. It was her own bedroom crammed into a trailer. Images sloshed through her. She had been in a white city in the dawn, the mist of the river still low to the streets. She had wandered a souk. There were bright fabrics decorating the passages and more for sale in stacks everywhere. She reached under her pillow. A cool ghost of a shape slipped from her grasp. She felt around but nothing stayed. She could smell a bit of river mud and duckweed. She dove down under the covers and looked back at the souk where she had bought beignets and a blue and gold fountain pen. The pen gave her left hand a little electrical shiver when she felt it in her vest pocket. Through an arched door she caught sight of four white hooves and golden fur patches bounding onto a wide lawn. She thought she saw her father next to the garden, on a low yellow stool like a mushroom. He was peeling back cornhusk on brilliant silver ears that he stacked into a tower. The empty shed stood open."
Hidden Secrets,"Javier walked across his large yard as usual, taking his Australian shepherd Zooloo out for her morning run. It was still early, the sun was just beginning to rise through soft hazy shades of pinks in the sky, frosted puffs of cotton breath in the air, promising a crisp day ahead.  Zooloo ran ahead of him, through the piles of leaves on the far side, near the maple and apple tree's, now darkened with the onset of winter; leaves fallen to the ground, branches bare and cold. Except for the wind rustling, silence permeated his surroundings. The frigid air moved through him, like a thousand tiny inch worms crawling into his bones. (He only wore a light jacket and jeans), not exactly ideal attire for a morning like this. Thin layers of crusted snow blanketed the fields. Time stood as still as the rocks, a simple life on this farm, Javier's thought's were on other things, like travelling.  Javier shivered, pulling his jacket tighter around him for warmth, wishing he'd worn a more suitable coat, 'winter is coming',  he mused unhappily, wishing he could go South like he often did, but he had to stay here and take care of their farm, belonging once to his grandparents, handed down to his parents. This is where he was raised and grew up, but he dreamed otherwise. His bedroom boasted a large world globe ball, the kind you turn around and around, Javier would, every night before bed, mark the spots with tiny different colored stickers. Midwest winters were harsh, however, summer's were spent growing and harvesting enough food for the winter. Their animals needed enought to eat and stay warm, chickens and two cow's they kept. Several barn cats, and sweet Zooloo, she acted like it was all hers, she was the life of the party. Javier watched her, as she began to sniff, digging around fervously around one of the maple's, picking on one spot in particular. Paws frantic, leaves pushed up and around, while her breath smoked out in huffs into the cold air.****""Ok, girl, take it easy, what have u got? A dead squirrel....you...can't...eat that."" He fondly scolded his dog, pulling at her halter, away from the spot she'd been digging, not wanting to see what she'd found if a dead animal lay beneath the dull leaves. Zavier's stomach growled, hunger crawling in him now, breakfast would be ready soon, his mother always on time. Routine had become redundant, but time flew by as they had plenty of chores to do.  ""What the heck?  Hmph, how did this get here?"" He said to noone. ****, waiting to be picked up, taken home. Javier stared, his face scrunching to look more at what he thought he'd found, he then picked it up. A diamond ring, a large one at that, surrounded by smaller perfect little stones, dirtied of course, and looking old. He wiped off the dirt with the cuff of his sweater, Zooloo already lost interest and was running around him in circle's now.'What the heck!"" His mind raced, ""Who does this belong to and why is it here, on our land, lyin' neath a pile of dead leaves, and how did Zoo know to find it?' These were all the questions running through his mind. Think. This ring is worth a fortune, definately enough to pay him a trip South, Florida or Cuba, wouldnt that be somethin' else. All his life he wanted to take that special trip, feel the warmth of sunshine, sit under palm tree's on a sandy white beach, just never happened, he was not going to leave his parents alone for now anyway, and he had to finish college. Once his Agriculture Degree was under his belt, diploma at hand, he might take a trip then, some of the local kids from town could help his parents out next winter for a month anyway, he could go somewhere.""I have to tell someone, where would I explain gettin' enough cash to go on a trip, this ring must've belonged to someone."",  he wiped back the sweat on his forehead, in spite of the temperature he was warm now, pulling shaggy hair back behind his ears, with strong weathered fingers, aged from work and the change of seasons for his age. He put the ring deep into the pocket of his jeans. Now he felt a sprig of anticipation seap into his veins at the find, wondering what it meant. ? This ring signified something, on their land. . He already knew who was going to tell it, he thought, knawing hunger continually winning him over.""Com'n Zoo, let's go home for breakfast, bacon and eggs girl?"" He called to his dog, who had already began to sniff out other spots and did her business. Tail wagging happily at the word ""breakfast"", she followed her master home, back to the warmth of the fireplace hearth and food. The kitchen already was full of the scent of coffee and bacon, he inhaled deeply as he stepped in from the cold. The large oak table was inviting, the fireplace warming the living room, food cooking on the gas range. The wood stove held the coffee pot, old cast iron having cooked a million meals in its time, already steaming with fresh made liquid. Javier bounded in through the door, leaving the empty field behind him as he entered the kitchen, slowing his pace down respectfully.*****""Go wash up breakfast is ready."" His mother said, tiredly. She rose early, began the cooking for the morning, made coffee, set the table, same old routine, then chores. She was in her fifties, signs of grey hair at the sides, once having been blond and beautiful hair, while her eyes portruded the laugh lines of living. Three generations here on this farm, she was a proud woman, the land was theirs. But nothing came without its price, and their land held its own secrets, she knew and kept to herself, no sense in dredging up what had been. ""Ma, I found something, or rather Zoo found it, in the leaves, stuck underneath one leaf."", Zavier pulled out the diamond, shoving a mouthful of scrambled eggs in at the same time, placing it on the table. ""Who's ring was it? It was on our property, near the big maple tree across the yard."", He added, precariously, feeling it belonged to him.""Let me see, oh dear, it was your grandmother's ring, I remember, you found it."" Her voice flat, poured coffee into her husband's mug, he sat silent, rarely speaking most of the time, Trent was non-sociable person. But a good kind man. His body etched up to get a glimpse of the ring, his strong shoulders tightened in anticipation of this discovery. He knew what happened, of course he knew, but they never talked about it. Not after the funeral, she was small then, a little girl. But something changed, as his wife took a deep breath, so intense that he could feel it from deep inside her.""Why would it be under a leaf?"" Zavier persisted, spreading strawberry jam on his buttered toast hungrily, now he was curious. It would appear a story was in the works here, and he was anxious to hear it. His mother rarely spoke of his grandparents, he often wondered why whenever he'd asked about them.""It's a long sad story, you may as well know now that you found their ring. It began a long time ago, after we were born here, in this house. Your grandfather was kind enough at first, but then, after the kids were born he began to drink, and it got worse."", She began, trying to remember that night, when the world changed for her grandmother and her aunts and uncle's, who witnessed the tragedy, left with the evils of alcohol and anger, and their struggle's to survive.What are you talking about? I ain't never been to that place in my life."" Gramps was pompous, overbearing as he'd shouted at his wife, a strong built woman herself, she stood up against him. Anette worked hard to keep the farm and her kids clothed and fed. Gabriel was already drunk, and in one of his moods, basted with alcohol, he hated himself enough lately, but he hated her nagging even more than himself. He'd loved his wife once, long before the kids were born, 8 children altogether, one having died, the last one.......then the cloud took over him. He tried to stop but couldn't.""I heard you was down at her shack, with that hillbilly whore, Eilleen told me at the bazaar, saw you two kissin' through the open window. At least you could've shut the blinds.""""I won't have my husband flaunting around, not with me or our children in this house, you hear me old man?"" Voice firm, her lips tight with angered emotion.She'd sounded more on the attack to him, his breath stenched heavily with the smell of booze, his face unshaven, his eyes darkened with the devil. He'd lashed back at out at her, threw her up against the wall, shouting. His large body overbearing on her small frame, Annette couldnt fight against him, fear stung through her like lightining bolts. For the first time in their marriage she began to back away from him steps unsure of their footing, the kids could hear everything from their rooms, and now they had come out and stood above the railing, watching with wide eyes, waiting for the moment to settle down.""I ain't done nothin', quit your haggling me over nothin' that happened at all. Those damn nosy busy bodies outta mind their own business"", He shoved her aside, and went out on the porch, lighting a cigarette and inhaling deeply. It was a hot muggy night for this time of the year, the air thick with humidity. Eilleen shuffled out after him, hoping to calm him down.""I dont want to fight, come back inside and eat your dinner."" She'd begged him, trying to take his arm and bring him inside. Aggravaton and anger took over after that. He yanked her hand away, aggressively. Eilleen teetered back, stumbling, on the top of the staircase facing the yard, she fell backwards. She hit her head, died the same night of concussion. The doctor was called and then the priest, leaving her husband with the aftermath of pain, and feeling responsible. In a truthful manner of speaking he was, even though it was a horrible accident, he had never meant to murder his wife. Gramps was never the same after that, inevitably so, he sunk into a deep depression, he couldn't face that horrible incident.""Finally, two years later, he died they said, of guilt and shame. It was also said her ghost walked this house before he died, he would say she came to pay him back for his wrong doings, for sure none of it was probably the truth, who knew?"" Javier's mother continued, fingers cradling her coffee mug. Outside the sun had risen, now shining through the kitchen window, glittering on her hair while she spoke, her voice deepened from sadness? ""His two sister's who came to live there and take care of him, and the kids had even heard strange noises, late into the hours of the night, but nothing was ever substantiated. Haunted house stories were not uncommon in farm country, this one was no exception to tall tales"", and now, the story was a demise, the words out like tar, poured onto the ground and tasting like a bitter black piece of gum.****'And so, Gramps of course was never the same, after the funeral he must have tossed the ring away on the ground, left there after all these years until now."" His mother finished the sad story. Zavier said nothing, feeling only the remnants of grief for his gramp and gram, the kids left behind with no father. Times were hard then, but they got harder, especially for those poor kids. Her face held back the anguish she never mentioned; she then continued to sit down and eat her own breakfast.Someday, he would go South, but not now, this ring was an heirloom piece, his mother would of course keep it, as she well deserved to keep it, the ring belonged to her. He got up, put a warm coat on, whistled to his dog, and went to the barn to do the morning chores. The tale of the tragedy that befell his family years before, the ghosts that lingered here, engulfed his heart heavy with memories of what he'd found that frosty morning under a leaf.THE END****************"
I never wanted to speak in public,"(CW - mentions of racism and privilege, as the character comes to terms with an uncomfortable truth about their life) I know when Im tired by the feeling in my bones, and my eyes. It feels like my whole body is chafed, irritated and aching all at the same time. I know I need to sleep. It's 3.18 am and I know I will be exhausted tomorrow. But I also know that I need to know everything that everyone is saying about me. Why, you ask? Because it is important to know how people see me after what happened last weekend. I need to know how their opinions have changed after what I said. Stretching my toes, I know that I should leave it there. Let the trolls stay up all night pondering why I said what I said and what rock I will crawl out of next. But I know that I wont, I cant. I am like a cat who has found the scent of a mouse. I need to know what will be said next. I didnt mean to be racist. I really didnt. Well, at least I think I didnt. Maybe thats the point? Trying not to be racist rather than just not being racist. It's almost like when your mom tells you to be nice, so you act nicely but would you have been nice without her prompt? Probably not. I still think that racist is a strong word for the views I have. Views I thought anyone would have had if they came from where I come from. No wait, not views. Opinions. I can be swayed. I am have an open mind, I am open and invite discussion and debates. I can't think of a time right now, but I certainly wouldn't turn down an opportunity! look at the work I have done saving the rainforest. that involved a lot of difficult conversations. ....am I actually openminded? I now no longer need to scroll, I simply refresh my feed and there's another one. I hold my breath as I open the comments, the meme itself could be mildly entertaining if its subject wasnt my humiliation. Still, I suppose it is the most accurate to what actually happened. I never wanted to speak in public, I was asked - no requested. As the second oldest woman in our family still working, I was told it was a great honour to represent the women of my family. So, like everything I try to do, I wanted to make our family proud, to make myself proud and to inspire the younger women in our troop. I also wanted to give a nod to our ancestors. The women and men who took on this land and made us the family we are. Wealthy. Intelligent. Independent. I am grateful to them. How was I to know that I was being live streamed onto Facebook? Would it have made a difference to what I said? No, probably not but at least I would have had a say in the matter.That is the real problem of this age. Consent. We must ask for it for everything, yet when it matters, we dont. People dont care about the impact their actions have on a person, as long as they have asked for consent first.But I did not consent to this. Who would have thought my own family would have asked me to leave OUR family reunion after my speech? Yes, it is true that I do not have children and it is also true that I do not have any friends from different countries or creeds. Indeed, I live a sheltered life on this island. But, I still deserve some respect. Especially from those who came after me. After all, they all still profit from our hard work on the ranch. My god, someone has said I should burn in hell! The views of the clip have reached nearly 500,000, and thats without including the shares and their views. Am I really that bad of a person that I should no longer exist? A tingle runs through my fingers and my eyes feel as though I am looking through a vortex tunnel. I NEED TO GET UP. I hate anxiety attacks. I know that it will not go away on its own. So I give up on sleeping. After all, what is the point in trying? Maybe I should put my version of the truth out there? My truth. Tell them my side. The public has only seen one side of the story.I am not a horrible person, I wanted to tell the story of our family to remind us of where we came from and how proud we should be of our heritage and family values. I am not a slave trader and I cant help that my family were. I should not be held accountable for their actions, and if so, why has no one else been accosted like I have?Someone has commented on my privilege. What does that even mean? Well, despite my familys wealth, I am not rich - not in the monetary sense. I shop at the local market, I dont wear expensive shoes or clothes. I rarely go on vacations. What makes me privileged? What is white privilege? After a quick google, I watched a video explaining white privilege and I am shocked. But it still isnt my experience. I havent taken a role destined for a person of colour. In fact, I never went to college or have a job, aside from our family ranching business. Sure, healthcare has never been hard for me to find, Dr Benson has always been available- she is such a dear! Admittedly, I cant imagine what it would be like to not have her. Where can you find a good Dr, or Dentist? Ok. If the definition of my privilege is this, then I have no choice but to slightly concur. That is correct, I have privilege- but doesnt everyone? The door creaks a little as I open it slowly, trying to be quiet. The sound of crashing waves in the distance brings me back to reality. After a few deep and intentional breaths, I remind myself of how much I have always loved it here. The combination of the salty fresh air and the sound of the waves crashing on the shore are the only sleeping tonic I have ever needed. Yet, how would my life be different without it?Ok, maybe in that respect, I also have some privilege. But that isn't down solely to my race, anyone could have found themselves in this position. If I was black and in this position, would I still have this privilege? I feel uncomfortable in thinking that in some ways I have had a head start in life. Something I had not chosen for myself, but that was provided to me because of when and where I was born and the people I have grown up around. My whole sense of self has been defined by the history of my family, and yet when I dig deep and think about what had to happen for this to be so, I can feel my body tensing. It feels as if my tonic has turned rancid. A bitter taste in my mouth has developed and I need to get rid of it. My mother always said that a good night's sleep solves all of life's problems. Perhaps shes right, but I suspect in this respect, she is wrong. Turning off my phone, I crawl back into my soft and ever inviting bed. My sanctuary. I pull the cover over my body and look up at the blank ceiling thinking of those without this luxury. The homeless, the poor, the deprived. The weight of this thought makes me sink further into my mattress. I feel the weight of this realisation and feel ashamed that these thoughts had not crossed my mind before. maybe that is also the point? Sometimes we need a reality check to truly know who we are and where were heading in life. I have a feeling that this may have been mine. I know now that I need to change and I dont know how, yet. But maybe I can start with an apology? Yes, tomorrow I will start there. Good night."
Morning,"This morning, I wake up and find a pregnant woman in bed beside me. In my bed. There's no mistaking the swelling of her belly. This woman, she's a young thing. From the side, she appears too young to be so pregnant, maybe 16 or 17 at the most. Shethe young womanhas long brown hair. Long. It flows everywhere, on her side, onto my side. And it has soft curls. Really pretty, I wish I had hair like that. I lean up on my elbow to see her face. You'd do the same, right? Maybe I shouldn't have. She has my husband's face. No shit! I've lived with him long enough to know the turned-up corners of his eyes, the sun browned freckles from our days on the beach, the subtle curve of his jaw, the gentle ridge of his nose, even the way his cheekbones form arches. There's no mistakeit's my husband's face. And yet... yet it's not his face. It's softer, smoother. It's lost the hardness of masculinity. I swear, those lips are fuller and form a cupid's bow that wasn't there yesterday. Sun flecked or not, she's definitely not my husband. I'm confused. She hears me stirring and opens her eyes. ""Hey,"" she says in a husky voice. ""G'morning."" Ohmygawd, she has my husband's voice. You think after 12 years of marriage I wouldn't recognize my own husband's voice? It's softer, melodic, but that's the way he greets me every morning: ""Hey. G'morning."" ""Who are you?"" I demand. ""What the hell are you doing in my bed?"" ""Huh?"" ""Where's my husband? Where's Conrad? How the hell did you get into my house?"" She turns her head so her facehis soft faceis full-on to me. ""Honey, I'm Conrad. I'm just..."" She pats her pregnant belly and winces. ""Isn't this neat? We're gonna have a baby."" ""Not in..."" Crap. How can I say this? Not in my bed? Not in my house? Not in my lifetime? But I don't feel that way. She seems like a nice little girl. How can I yell at her? Could you? Andandand we tried really hard to conceive a child. For the last 13 years, since we got married, nothing worked. They say I'm fertile. They say Conrad's fertile. They say there's no reason we couldn't. I'm 33 years old and I finally gave up. ""Not in...?"" she wonders, as a distracted look flits across that familiar face. ""... in this house? Honey? Don't you recognize me? Does the belly confuse you?"" Well, yeah. Yeah, it does. It really does. How can someone go to bed male and wake up pregnant? ""This is crazy. Where's my husband...?"" She frowns. ""I'm your husband. Really..."" She stares down at herself. ""No, I guess I'm not anymore."" She makes a ball with her fist, presses it against her uterus. ""That's right. I can tell looking at you that you're not. How did you get in? Where did you come from?"" She stretches and the blanket slips off. She's naked, naked all the way to her toes. This pregnant woman with my husband's face and voicefrom the look of her breasts, she's almost ready to nurse. She sees where I'm staring and cups her hands around them. ""Neat, huh?"" she says. ""Yeah. Neat,"" I answer grumpily. ""Just peachy."" Then there's that look again, that pained look, as if to say come on woman, get with the program here. ""What am I supposed to do? You were asleep and I didn't want to wake you up. This just kind of... happened."" I'm not seeing thisit isn't true. Please God, pleads my head, when I open my eyes, please make her not be here. But my eyes still see a pregnant woman. She swings her legs over the side of the bed. Something stops her momentarily, a guarded wary hesitation. ""I gotta pee,"" she says, going into our connected bathroom. She waddles when she walks, like a... a... damn it, a pregnant woman. In a feminine way, that's how he stands. That's how he walks, holds his head. Except for the awkward pregnant arch of her backshe could be Conrad's younger sister. Still, there's no mistake. Those are Conrad's eyes. That's how he always looks at me, with a sort of sentimental tilt, a subconscious twinkle. She loves me. Damn. ""Look,"" I hear myself say as she sits on the toilet facing me. ""Look, girly. I don't know how..."" Crap, why am I angry? She's done nothing to incur that, except be here. Here, now, when I least expected her. She finishes in the bathroom, wiping herself with a big wad of tissue. There are tears in her eyes, shining in the glare of the bathroom fixture. Her tits start to shudder from little sobs and a drip pauses at the tip of her nose. She dabs at it with more tissue. ""I... I don't know how to... to convince you that I'm me,"" she says. ""I didn't do this on purpose. It just happened."" ""Shit, you expect me to believe that?"" ""Please? Please see with your heart, not your eyes."" Ouch. That's such a Conrad thing to say. I married him because he seemed to understand me, understand how I felt, even when I didn't understand myself. ""You can't be him,"" I tell her. ""You're soft, feminine."" ""And... pregnant. Is that it? Is that what's..."" There's that hurt look again, fleeting across her face. ""I'm cold."" I'm starting to feel sorry for this bloated slip of a girlthe way she cradles her belly in her hands, the way she sways, bracing her back against the baby's weight. She's trembling. ""Wear my robe. It's too long but it will do until I can find you something that fits. We'll go to the mall this afternoon and buy you some maternity clothes that are presentable."" ""I guess that means you won't throw me out?"" Oh hell. Okay, so I can't throw her out. It's clear she has nowhere to go. She gives me as much of a hug as her belly will allow when I put the robe around her. ""Thank you,"" she whispers. Except that it's ""thang k'you"" in hisConrad'slight accent, and she doesn't even know she says it that way. His way. I still wonderam I going insane? It can't be possible, you know. What would cause a 35-year-old man, a husky outdoorsy man, to transform into a pregnant girl? From her appearance, she's lost half of Conrad's age. And she accepts it so nonchalantly. Shouldn't she, shouldn't he, be freaking out to wake up like this? This young girl, she waddles gingerly after me as I go to the kitchen. She's having a tough time; she's panting, sharp breathes she doesn't want me to hear. Before I can offer her anything, she gets Conrad's favorite cup out of the dishwasher. Sweet man that he is, he washed the dishes last night after I went to bed. She couldn't have known it was there. Could she? Well... could she? She pours coffee just the way he does. She catches me looking at her and smiles. Yeah, it's his face alright, that's his smile. She shakes her head to get the hair out of her eyes and sips the hot brew. It must be too hot because she winces again. How would I treat this if I saw it on the nightly news? ""My husband was a pregnant girl when I woke up this morning. He wasn't pregnant at bedtime last night. And he's never been a girl before."" Yeah, right. She seems awfully nervous now. She keeps flicking those... those dreamy blue eyes. His eyes were always so beautiful, so hypnotic. I think that's what I fell in love with when I first met him. What am I thinking? Am I just imagining that she's him. How would you handle this? Her coffee cup is on the counter now, as though she's afraid she'll drop it. I frown. ""Are you okay?"" ""No,"" she says. Her voice cracks. It's thin, reedy, and worried. ""I just pee'd all over myself. I... I'm sorry about the mess. I'll clean it up."" I look down. She's right, the kitchen floor is wet. But it's not pee. My gawd, her water just broke. She's going into labor. ""How long has this been happening,"" I ask. ""How far apart are the contractions?"" ""Contractions?"" she wonders as I seat her gently into a chair. Doesn't she know? ""The sharp pains. In your belly. How long?"" ""All night,"" she says. ""I didn't want to wake you up."" She... she didn't want to wake me up... she's a hell of a lot braver than I'd be. Now it makes sense, the quizzical looks, the odd way she's been holding her belly, the fleeting glimpses of pain. She has no idea what labor is. And I've been too stupid to recognize it. But every woman knows about labor. We talk endlessly about having babies, about the pain, about how to handle it. My mother told me about childbirth. Prepared me for my role in the natural rhythm. Even though I can't seem to conceive, it's part of growing up female. This girl... look at her. The pain is making her miserable, and she doesn't understand. She shuffles her feet aimlessly. This is no joke. She really is pregnant. Whoever the father was... I wonder if there was one or this is some kind of... of... oh, hell, I don't know. Anyway, he's not hereand the only help she has is me. I squint at her. Yes, she's in agony. Her belly clenches and unclenches. So do her fists, hidden between her legs where she thinks I can't see them. The coffee maker whispers in the background as I watch the clock on the stove. One minute. One and a half. Two minutes apart. That means she's nearly ready. I sprint for the phone and call 9-1-1. ""My..."" I look at her sitting so stiffly, so stoically and almost say the unthinkablemy husbandbut catch myself. ""My daughter is in labor,"" I lie. ""Her contractions are about two minutes apart."" ""We'll send a unit right away, ma'am. What's your address...?"" It's so close, too close. She's down on her back screaming when the medics get here, giving in at last to the pain ripping through her. And it seems only moments before I hear the baby's first cry. The paramedics are gone. They've given her a sedative, not enough to knock her out but just enough to put her at ease from the leftover pain. The look in her eyes as they laid the baby girl on her chest, that look says it all. Look what we did, they plead to me. Look, a little girl. Don't send us away now. Please? I can see the top of its little pink head, with little wisps of hair, as it nurses on her tit. ""She's beautiful,"" I say, sitting on the edge of the sofa looking down at them. She looks up at me and smiles. ""Thang k'you, Gretchen,"" she says. Hmmm. In the time between waking and now, in the madness of giving birth, I don't remember telling anyone my name. The dispatcher only asked for the address. And I know the girl didn't ask, not in the bedroom, not over the coffee cup. And then she couldn't, once we both figured out the reason she was suffering. I sigh. ""Not a problem, Connie,"" I hear myself say. If she's not Conrad, if she's a stranger... well, she still needs a roof over her head for a while. Until the baby is older. I don't know her name, so Connie will have to suffice. And if she really is Conrad, it's a lousy name for the new baby's mother. Conniethat's a lot nicer, more feminine, a good name for a young woman who's just birthed a daughter. The baby is finished nursing now, asleep in the crook of Connie's arm. With her free hand, Connie pulls the robe over her breast, hiding the nipple. Looking fondly at them, I think... no matter what happened, she could be my daughter. I guess that means I'm a grandmother now. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be, maybe it's all for a reason. But I'm still confused. What would you do? What would you do if a stranger, a pregnant woman, was lying beside you when you woke up? A stranger with your husband's face?"
Broken House Rules,"Everything was ready for the ritual. The thing about it was that Leaf Cole could not recall how he became a part of it, at least not yet. His only assignment was to go down and take pictures of this small town in Massachusetts for a possible movie. He rented a place from the Slices when he arrived. The Slices included Bryan & Lucy the parents and John the oldest son and two daughters who where away.  The room he rented in the Slices home was nice. It wasnt empty but it did have some decent things in it. The Slices themselves seemed like normal people but boy he was to find out how wrong he was. He had missed all the possible signs even before he started his trip. The supposed movie he was to take pictures for was a ghost story. He didnt think anything about it at the beginning, but he wishes now he had. What was there to ask questions about? It was a movie; he was taking pictures and that was it. He wasnt in the movie Leaf thought. That was hint number one, he thought to himself as his eyes tried to bring into focus what his mind simply could not comprehend. The room wasnt pitch black nor was it bright as day. That distinction led him to think, exactly how long had he been in that room? He truly did not know if it was night or day. The second clue Leaf missed was the houses in the Slices neighborhood. There were three stories houses that were almost identical. They were colors he had never seen on houses before. This too he gave no thought because he was from New York, there are colors everywhere.He went over in his head the many things he ignored that perhaps he shouldnt have. The family themselves seemed fine but what he did recall was the constant warning about the House Rules. But there wasnt any House Rules, as in more than one, there was only one. Bryan, Lucy, and John made it their business to make sure he was told to read them. The night he arrived after dinner Leaf made it his business to do just that. There was only one house rule, never open the attic door.""  Leaf tried to remember how he got in this room, was this the attic? Why, what was in the attic he had wondered. Leaf for many days had shaken off the curiosity to look. It kept getting the best of him because of the repeated admonishment to read the house rules. Leaf took in a deep breath as memories of how he got in the room flooded back. It was weird to him, but he found himself more disappointed than scared. He recalled late one night when he thought everyone was gone. He turned the knob of the attic door. As he ascended the stairs he was hit on the back of his head. Today, he awakens and doesnt know how long hes been out. Leaf was tied down on what felt to him to be some type of gurney. He was tied hands and feet, but not his torso or lower limbs nor his head. With the hint of light that did enter the room he could see what looked like coffins. He started to scream and thrash about, yelling for the Slices. He soon heard steps coming up the stairs. He couldnt believe his eyes it was Saw Sawn, his boss from New York. Leaf asked, What is this Mr. Sawn, what are you doing here? Sam walked across the room and turned on the light switch just over Leaf head. Leaf looked at him and there was nothing he noticed about the man that would have made him question anything. There wasnt today nor had there ever been. But why would he be here as a part of what looked like something crazy. He was just Mr. Sawn. He was a suit and tie kind of guy. His shoes always polished to shine. His hair always neatly laid. Leaf thought maybe thats what it was, Sawn was always suit and tie dressed, no matter the occasion. Whether it was dinner, lunch, brunch, or supper he was going to be dressed. No one thought it strange especially not Leaf because he recalled his father was a little like Sawn. So, Leaf paid it no mind, he wishes he had of now. Leaf noticed that even after Sawn turned on the light switch only one solid light came on. Leaf raised up just enough to see two coffins, now clearer. What is going on here? Leaf yells in Sawns direction. Leaf you are a part of an experiment my son. There is no movie. The ad in the paper, I put it there. I knew you would choose mines. Sawn replied. Mr. Sawn already knew Leaf was going to pick his ad. He had been dropping hints about the whole thing, into Leafs subconscious weeks before. The boy never picked up on it, even after Sawn begin talking to him about it. Leaf was such an easy target, Sawn would say. So, Im here what do you want with me, what experiment? Leaf angrily asked.What have you done with the Slices he yelled? Well, my boy they are fine. Theyre apart of this too. You didnt find them odd or better yet this neighborhood nor this house? No of course you didnt, did you? Sawm asked. Leaf continued attempts to untie himself even while Sawn was still in the room begin to aggravate Sawn. Please stop, you must keep up your strength. He would often tell Leaf this of which Leaf would reply, strength for what? It wasnt the trying to get away as much as it was his constants asking of questions that drove Sawn crazy. What is this for What is that for? Where is Bryan, Lucy and John? Why arent you gagged? Sawn would turn and asked Leaf. Sawn had warned the Slices that Leaf needed to be gagged because he would be screaming. The Slices had assured Sam they would be back before he awoke.  And so they were about an hour or so after Sam arrival here comes the Slices, the parents and John.Leaf however recalled that Bryan had told him they had three kids, a boy and two girls. The girls were away, at least that was what Leaf was told. He had only met John, where were the two girls? Leaf with shock in his eyes turned his head to the right looked over at the two coffins. There standing by each coffin was a member of the Slice family. All Leaf heard before he passed out due to shock was, everything is ready for the ritual."
Styx and Stones,"A cold thick fog enveloped the muddy banks of the River Styx, chilling Persephones ankles. Demeter pulled Persephones coarsely woven robes tightly around herrobes of finely combed linen made from flax soaked in olive oil. When dried in the balmy Grecian sun, Persephones clothing smelled of newborn lambs and gentle sunbeams and fresh mown grass, but her dark destination had none of those sensationsnothing to smell, nothing to taste, nothing to feel.Demeter kissed her daughters forehead.I do not want to go back, Persephone cried out. Demeter gathered her only child into her arms, drawing her close. In the warmth of the embrace, both of the goddesses could feel the others broken heart still beating. Persephone looked up in time to see her mothers grief stricken face, jaw clenched and eyes ablaze.Are you angry with me? Persephone asked.No, my love, her mother replied, steeling herself, making her heart a stone. It would resolve nothing to weep in front of her child. I am angry with six pomegranate seeds and the duplicity of the gods.Even as they walked stoically out of the realm of men, Persephone noticed how Demeter blasted the land behind them with an Aeolian wind. Trees shook off their colorful autumnal leaves. Vines dropped their fruit. The fair land and its lavish bounty rotted and decayed as the two passed. Trailing their footfalls, the verdant greens of the landscape withered into ugly browns, sending a shudder down the spines of superstitious men. Death seemed nearer, as the darkness encroached earlier and earlier, shortening their days.The goddesses proceeded out of the mortal world hand in hand, Persephones small white hand clasped in her mothers large callused one. Browned by the sun, Demeter loved working in the fall fieldsloved the harvestloved reaping grain with her sharp scythe, standing next to the illiterate laborers, all rejoicing in the earths richness. But as the time drew nearer for Persephone to return to the Underworld, her mother grew quieter, more withdrawn.She seldom left their rustic abode late in the season, preferring to sit by the fire and hull barley by hand, dehusking the grains with mortar and pestle, grinding them into a fine flour. Old widows around the Aegean Sea found linen bags full of barley meal placed under their straw-filled pillows as they slept, necessary foodstuffs to keep them alive throughout the winter.When Persephone arrived safely home to her in the spring, Demeter would breathe life back into Gaia, warming the soil, fertilizing the womb, reanimating the natural world. Until then, Demeter would sit by the River Styx and wait, brooding and counting the times Helios drove his chariot from east to west.Persephone attempted to keep her lips from quivering, swallowing hard, blinking back hot tears. But the coldness of the riverbanks fog startled her, reminding her of all the bleak months she would have to be at Hades' side, the souls of the dead swirling and bewailing their fates around them. It was enough to drive her to madness.Persephone wept again freely. Her mother stood nearby, rubbing her back like a small child until Persephones sobs subsided. Her mother did not cry.Are you thirsty? Demeter asked.Her daughter nodded.From her girdle, Demeter unstrapped a small wineskin, full of barley-water flavored with mint. Drink while you can, my dearest.Persephone quaffed her fill while her mother kept watch, their sandals unsettlingly sinking in the mire. Standing by the River Styx, Demeter watched the murky water roil in whirlpools as far as the eye could see.Finally, she spotted Charon, the ferryman, still a good ways off. Demeter bitterly wished his infernal boat would capsize and drown him for good, but the old haggard fool remained relentless in his approach. Even from a distance, Demeter could see him adroitly wield his ferrymans pole. She needed to say her goodbyes, as Charon was fastidious about his transporting the dead with exactness and alacrity. There would be no quarter given to mothers who wanted a bit more time with their children, even though it was wholly unnatural for children to leave their mothers behind while descending to the Underworld.Charon was coming, and even the gods were afraid of his bad-tempered outbursts.When Persephone returned the wineskin to her mother, Demeter pressed a small silver coin into her hands, a , to pay for her trip into the realm of the dead.For the ferryman, Demeter reminded her. Do not look Charon in the eye. He knows where to take you in the dark. Do not be afraid. He knows to whom you belong.At the mention of Hades, Persephone's eyes closed in despair. Demeter held her again, her daughter silently weeping along the moldy river bank.Will you think of me? her daughter pleaded, watching Charon maneuver his craft to the shore, displacing the fog.I do not ever stop thinking of you, Demeter replied, offering her daughter a tender smile, the same smile that appeared over her cradle not so many years before.It is so long until springHow could I ever forget you, Persephone? You grew in my womb just under my heart. You are my only child and my beloved, dutiful daughter. I have the days numbered until you return to me.  , her daughter said.Yes, one hundred and eighty two days . . . Demeter repeated.Charon motioned and grunted for her to embark, holding out his hand and scowling. Persephone placed the in his hand, which quickly disappeared into his robes. , Persephone whispered, a foot on the boat, turning for one long look at her mothers weathered face.I love you, too, her mother replied, sending her daughter off to a cold hell with a warm smile.Persephone crouched in the hull, looking for her mother on the banks of the River Styx until out of eyesight.I will be here until you return, Demeter called out into the night.Through the gloom she could just make out the whiteness of her daughters hand, waving a farewellthe sight of which dissolved the stone in Demeter's heart, turning it into a river of tears."
The Curse of Blackwater,"Ages ago, when petty kings fought for dominance over the land, lawlessness and cruelty were sovereign. Chaos was most rampant in the neglected countryside, far removed from the trappings of civilization. The Lords, busy with their squabbles, cared naught for the common folk. They waged war as long as there were boys to be taken and armed for their hosts. One such Lord, a knight no less, was a man of bravery but also fierce temperament. His victories in war made him rich both from its spoils, as well as from his liege's favor - none other than the king. After a great victory against another claimant, Sir Bernard was rewarded with his very own fort in the outmost fringes of the realm. With it came the title of Lord of the remote village it towered over - Blackwater. This gave the knight plenty of opportunities to launch unsanctioned raids and wreak havoc on the settlements beyond the King's border. Battle had made the knight a callous commander and, after endless seasons of bloodletting and war atrocities, Sir Bernard was more beast than man. Too many years he had spent on the back of his war horse. No company but that of his merciless henchmen; sleeping rough, ever clutching a blade. With plunder and murder as his daily bread, he no longer knew any law but that of the sword - his sword.With time, Sir Bernard's reputation as a savage warlord grew. Invitations for feasts became sparser and sparser, until they stopped altogether. The once-celebrated champion of the king was now thought to be no more than a glorified cutthroat. Company with whom not even the most modest of the gentry would want to be associated.At first, the knight was downhearted to be made an outcast. Bitter and assailed by self-pity, he soon found refuge in drinking. Whenever he would drown himself in liquor, violence soon followed and his fits of anger often resulted in a frenzy of cruelty inflicted on his own people. It wasn't long until everyone learned to avoid the fort as much as possible. Even his servants dared not risk his attention for long, lest they became the target of his malice. Thus did the peasants of Blackwater took to calling their Lord, Bernard Black-heart.Bernard's heart might had been rotting, but his mind was as sharp as his blade. With age, his martial prowess declined. He knew that if he could not carry on with his raiding parties, the silver would dry up. There was only one option - he needed to marry into wealth. It was an unwonted apparition witnessed by that fateful Sunday's mass. One met with surprise and a wave of whispers of hushed-tone gossip. Everyone knew better than to interrupt service, for the priest was a zealot and bitter man keen on inflicting punishment on the less pious. But even he found himself unable to utter a single word from his half-gaped mouth, when Sir Bernard walked through the church's door, accompanied by armed men.Ever since the Lord had taken residence in the fort, the priest recalled only but a handful of events wherein his church had hosted such company. Even then, only in the distant times when the king still honored Blackwater with a royal visit.The black knight strode down the nave's aisle to the front of the altar, where the most preeminent freemen attended mass. There, he greeted them and signaled the priest to continue before giving the shocked congregants a chance to bow.At the end of mass, the custom was for villagers to linger and exchange niceties as well as gossip. But that day, all eyes were on the knight, who waited not for his intentions to become clear. He approached the elderly patriarch of a rich merchant family and, with a solemn tone, announced his wish to marry the man's only daughter - Lillian was her name.The old man was speechless and looked over at the scared girl who cowered behind the tall figures of her brothers. Their faces betrayed the revulsion to the idea of marrying their sister to a man of such infamy. Knowing their place all too well, they bit their tongues.The father invited their Lord to discuss the matter further in the privacy of their townhouse. It was no secret Sir Bernard's coffers were running low and that her dowry was the solution for the knight's problems. His reaction, however, they did not expect. Offended, he wondered aloud what a high-born would do in the abode of ones such as themselves. The church echoed with murmurs and the old man felt the people's gaze like a humiliating pierce. The proposal stood, as Sir Bernard put it, most beneficial: The merchant's daughter would be elevated to nobility, as well as any children she would bear him. With a child on the way, the king, who worried over the continuity of that borderland's defense, had promised to make him a Baron. An opportunity to bring the mercantile family into the circles of high-nobility came less than once in a lifetime.They hesitated, as the mumbles of the eavesdropping townsfolk ceased and turned into looks of envy.And thus, reluctantly, they agreed to the proposal and shook hands with the Lord, as tears gathered at the corners of the girl's eyes. Her frightened stare met only with the most devious of grins, as Sir Bernard Blackheart bowed before departing. But they had all been tricked. For Sir Bernard's lies and machinations were deep as his lust for riches. In truth, a royal missive had arrived threatening to depose him of his fief. The king feared indeed for its defense but aimed to grant it to a younger, stronger Lord who could keep taking the fight to the enemy. A decision the Blackheart Knight was confident he could overrule with the birth of an heir, and a decent amount of silver. When the girl's protective brothers heard of this, they were livid and came at once to the fort of Blackwater. There, they mustered their courage and confronted the knight with these rumors. Emboldened by their own audacity, they questioned the Lord's ability to provide comfort for their sister.The servants and guards all held their breath for the poor brothers. They above all were accustomed to their master's temper and cruelty, even towards those who groveled beneath him.To their shock, Sir Bernard replied calm and collected, as to what evidence had they of this claim. The punishment for such unfounded accusations was severe and it ended especially bad when coming from those of lower birth. He questioned them if they had considered the rumor's veracity before spreading slander.Taken aback, the brothers swore on their lives they had not uttered a single word to a living soul. They had found it more honorable to come with the news straight to the Knight himself and grant him a chance to defend his honor. Not even their father knew they had come to the fort.Sir Blackheart grinned once again, as he did that day in the church. Not only were the rumors true, but also spread of his own volition. He had counted on the brother's hasty confrontation. With their whereabouts unaccounted for, he had them murdered right there and then.Honor, he thought, always shoved young men at sharpened steel.With one command of his voice, the knight became the sole inheritor of the merchant's wealth, as soon as he married Lillian. Their father, however, suspected what had happened. Without proof, he could not avenge the murder of his sons, but he could still call off the wedding.This too, Sir Blackheart had anticipated. His men were sent out to capture Lillian and bring her back to his fort. Once there, he raped her before her captors could even leave.When her father noticed her missing, he feared the worst and roused some village folk to storm the fort. Most dared not raise arms against such an unforgiving Lord, but the promise of wealth was enough encouragement for a small mob to muster.Blackheart had for the third time been expecting this. At the fort's threshold, he stood with but a few warriors and the town priest. Still bloodied, Lillian stood not far behind. The Blackheart Knight, once again calm, inquired what business had the old merchant with an armed host at his doorstep.The father demanded his daughter back. At such old age, his ability to fight was questionable, but his eyes burned with wild bloodlust.Sir Blackheart put on his darkest grin yet. He asked the priest whether he had not been a witness to the betrothal that had taken place in his very own church, before God Himself. The priest nodded, his gaze heavy to the ground.It dawned on the old merchant what the knight had plotted from the very beginning - It was no accident the request had taken place during mass. What he could not have foreseen was when Sir Blackheart lowered his head and confessed to kidnap and rape.Bewilderment overcame the mob as Sir Bernard Blackheart asked for forgiveness from the girl's father. His confession to the priest, the knight added, not being enough to uplift his soul.Met only with ominous silence, Sir Blackheart continued his petition. The waiting had been too much for him to bear. Fearing the spread of ill rumors to be a plot to break the engagement, he acted.However, a compromise could still be reached. He was willing to give Lillian back if her father admitted to the plot and paid for damages to his reputation. Or he would marry her in that instant, preserving her honor and even forgoing her dowry.The old man dropped his weapon and knelt to the ground sobbing. It was over. He could never take his little girl home.Admitting to plot against a noble would surely ruin him. His family's name would be dragged in the mud and he would never do business again. A life of begging in the streets awaited him, without any means to provide for Lillian. This assuming his own life would even be spared.There was no one to appeal to either - The priest and witnesses most likely siding with the Knight for fear of retribution. If only he could still give his little girl's hand in marriage to another man, then maybe she could still have a second chance at life. But with her purity defiled, no one would ever take her as a wife.With a last cry, he looked her in the eyes and reached for his knife. As he pushed it into his feeble heart, he prayed to God the Blackheart Knight would die soon after. Lillian was inconsolable. One moment she was frolicking in her youth and wealth, another, her entire family had been taken from her. All she had left was a life sentenced to serve the man who had destroyed or defiled everything she held dear. She pleaded with the priest, a holy man, to what kind of God would allow for this to happen. God, she was told, was infinite in His wisdom. And as a woman, she was sinful by nature. To repent, she was told to do. Life was no longer worth living for Lillian, but the thought of revenge kept her going forward. Every morning and every night she would pray for God to execute divine justice and smite down her husband.But she would not just wait and let fate take its course. With her wealth and newfound status, she had a convent built for His worship. Also, a place where women who had lost everything could dedicate their lives to God - a fate she wished for herself before her age had awoken the lust of cruel men.But even there, she was confronted with the priest who had been an accomplice to her husband's crimes. Undermining her efforts and belittling her cause, he put forth every obstacle imaginable against women joining the convent. Ever since its founding, none but a handful of souls had entered its service.Lillian's life was torture and a constant reminder that God was deaf to her suffering, as were all His subjects. One day, her heart sank as she came to learn her biggest fear had came true - She was with child.The thought of bearing the spawn of that sadistic man made her sick to her soul. It was then she decided to take drastic measures and for the first time in her life, a woman's life, be the one in control.If God was not willing to listen to her pleas, there was another who was willing and able - the Devil. She knew what had to be done. Renouncing God was the easy part. He had never brought her solace. Hell couldn't possible hold any surprises for her.Pledging herself to the Lord of Darkness was a harrowing experience, but the reward would be the power to undo her enemies.In the end, there was but one last price she needed to pay for binding her soul in fiery damnation - the blood of the innocent. Not only innocent but high-born too, she thought to sweeten the deal. Without hesitation, she took the knife her father had used to end his own life and plunged it into her womb. Blood was everywhere and her vision started to fade, but she could not help but smile. For most, this would be the end. But not for Lady Lillian of Blackwater - The Devil had accepted her pact. She woke up from her dreamless slumber on a bed in her namesake convent. Surrounded by the poor souls who tirelessly maintained it despite the lack of novices. They told her, she had been asleep for weeks on end. In that time a lot had happened.Upon finding out his unborn child would never live, Sir Blackheart had flown into the biggest rage yet. He had burned the entire village to the ground and holed up in his fort when he heard the King had sent a Baron, to claim the fief as his own. The siege lasted but a few days and the Baron had stormed the tower and killed her husband.Sir Bernard of Blackwater, the Blackheart Knight was dead. Lillian could not contain the tears of joy. The Devil was true to his word, it seemed. But that was not all. The Baron, having other fiefs to manage, had departed and abandoned the fort in ruins.There was no more Blackwater, only ashes. Lillian's home, burnt to the ground, would never be rebuilt without a Lord in the now derelict fort.Her freedom, she thought, would have nay a price too high. Lillian recovered fast and soon took on the robes of Abbess at the remote and lonely convent of Blackwater. But her vendetta was far from over, and she had no intention of betraying her Dark Lord to whom she had pledged her soul.There was one more man she sought to bring down - the priest. Lillian's dreams were filled with dark omens and terrible insights. She had learned the whereabouts of said priest, but also that her sisters had all been defiled by him in the past. Alllocked away in that remote convent so that one man could relieve himself of any urges of the flesh without consequence.She summoned them all and laid her vision of vengeance. A vision where women were not a commodity, a vision where they would not suffer because they had been born women. A vision where what made them women was not sin, but a gift to be wielded. Not by whatever morals a deaf God dictated, but by their own whims and principles. That night, all five sisters made a solemn oath. Not to the Devil, but to each other, with the Dark Lord as witness. They asked for power and the price remained the same. That night, five babies went missing in the black of the night, snatched from their cribs. Their high-born blood, the ink to seal dark vows. That terrible and darkest of nights, the convent and its most unholy order were reborn as the Coven of Blackwater. Its mission would be forever to elevate women from the yoke of God-fearing men. Baptized with the blood of an anointed priest, she now proudly stood as Lilith, the witch of Blackwater, first of her kind, and the head of the Coven. And since that day, every year on All Hallows' Eve they uphold their vows: To feast on the blood of little princes and barons alike. To feast on them for as long as women need to be witches, just so that they may belong to none but themselves."
Degrees of Sound,"There is no such thing as silence, only degrees of sound. When one imagines sound, or noise, they imagine loud things. Cities, concerts, car crashes. Sudden or prolonged high degrees of sound. When one imagines silence, they may picture many things. Empty woods, a nighttime street, a cemetery. When Ben made the decision to take a vacation in a small isolated house on the seaside in Maine, he had certainly imagined silence.Instead, there was just a different degree of noise. The world outside did not stay silent in the absence of humans. Instead, it raised its own volumes. A legion of crickets chirped away in the summer night, wind from a storm still days away twisted and moved the trees into an uneven orchestra of wood, strange animals made either mating or death calls deeper into the forest behind the house, while the ocean crashed and roared upon the rocks a few dozen feet in front of and below the house. The house itself was no better. It did not stay silent. Its wooden construction moaned and creaked with each strong gust of wind, and when there was no wind, the wood instead settled into place.What the noise wasnt was the sound of humanity. No cars or their horns, no shouting or crying. This was as close as Ben could get to the world without Humanity, and to him that was close enough to silence to satisfy. He let the relative silence wash over him as he sat back in the reclining chair in his temporary living room. It was one of three points of interest in the small space along with an old and small couch, and an ancient television that created a field of static whenever it was turned on. He ignored the television, focusing instead on a dry book about gardening he had brought with him on the trip. The book tended to make him relax and grow sleepy, which was a good complimentary effect to the lack of Human sound. The books effect was powerful when combined with the sounds outside, and before he knew it, Ben was putting the book down and falling asleep right in the reclining chair. Drifting off to the sounds of the endless sound of waves on rock. Then, he was shot awake by a high degree of sound. His eyes blasted open, recognizing it as the sound of the old wooden door slamming shut, as it tended to do when it was windy. He made to move, but found his body locked in place. He couldnt move much beyond his eyes. And he wasnt alone. In the living room, staring at the television, was a Human. Only it wasnt. It shared a general human shape, or close to it, but instead of flesh and blood seemed to be made up of sea mist and a collection of wet tree leaves. The concoction swirled around itself in a human-like shape, and the human-like head seemed to be tilted towards the television. If he was able, Ben wouldve shrieked. Despite his lack of noise, the figure stopped looking at the television, and looked to him instead. It didnt speak, it had no mouth after all. Instead, Bens vision seemed to cloud as an ocean wind barreled into his mind. Inside his head, he could hear reverberations that resembled those of the ocean falling upon the rocks outside. But they were more formed, they had more of a shape than the tranquil chaos of the rocks beyond. But the shape didnt coalesce for him. Once again, the figure barreled him with the noise, and finally the shape of the noise came into focus. They were words, distant and hard to fixate on, but they were there. You are loud. The words informed. Ben blinked; his brain overwhelmed from what was happening. In seeming response, the figure moved over to a nearby window, and without words or much movement seemed to blast it open, the wooden hinges giving way as the wood framed sides of the window slammed into the walls beside it. Once again, the figure blasted him with its words. You are loud. It said once more. Bens confusion shaped into coherence somewhat. He tried to form words, but his mouth would not cooperate. How could he be loud when thisthing was slamming windows and doors? The figure pushed its form of words into him once again, seemingly in response to his own thoughts. Your breathing, the creaking of your dead tree shelter, the small radioactive square in your pocket, the ceaseless sighing. It is loud. The thing chastised. Ben wasnt sure how to respond, was it reading his thoughts? Do not question. It is an observation. You are loud. The thing slammed into him once again. But Ben was here for silence, not noise, quite the opposite. He wanted to get away from the noise of other people. ""You bring your breath, you bring your loud explosive metal creation of rubber and steel, you bring the ceaseless radiation of your small black touching square stones. You are loud. It said in correction. Ben didnt know how to react, except that he was sorry? You always come. You bring your noise and your waste. Silence is preferable. It intoned into him. But nature itself was noise, the animals and the ocean were noise. This THING was noise. This is meant to be. Your noise is not. It said. If it had emotions underneath the cracking and crashing of its voice Ben couldnt read them. Ben thought he wasnt sure exactly what to do about that, his existence was noise then. Yes, you are loud. The thing confirmed. Ben thought on anyway. If his existence was noise, what could he do about it? Consider more. All of you could do so. It said to him. Ben was equal parts terrified and confused at this point. Consider more. Your blocks of radiation. The black sludge of dead creatures that leaks from your explosive metal construct. The sound of your ceaseless sighing. Silence is desired, you are here. Consider it. The voice had taken something resembling a patronizing tone, as much as crashing rocks and water could have such a tone, it was the closest to an emotion the thing had managed to have thus far. Ben was mostly just back to terrified now. Consider. It commanded. And Ben mentally agreed. Bens eyes blasted open. It was daytime now. He could hear the silence of the ocean crashing, though more distant now with the tide being out. The trees continued to creak and crack with the wind, though the tone was different. He shot out of the chair, taking deep panicked breaths. As he looked around though, there was no sign of thewhatever it was. Calmness began to find him as he looked around, confirming the lack of signs of intrusion. Though questions against his sanity remained. As he circled the living room, listening to the sound of his breathing and panting, he noticed the window. It had been blown open, seemingly by wind. At the base of the wall, under the window, Ben noticed a shimmer. He knelt and put his hand on the floor. His hand met hardwood floor, mixed with a faint wetness and a damp tree leaves. He stood up, his heart pounding more than it had been. It probably blew open while he was asleep, and the leaves just mixed with sea air. It was a solid explanation. He still decided to turn off his phone for the rest of his visit."
Breaking All the Rules,"Todays the day I change, Leaf thought as he laid on the gurney. His entire life for that matter would be changing. He also knew in that moment it would be changing for the bad and not the good. He had to come up with a plan to get out of that attic and away from the Slices. He wanted to survive whatever they had planned for him. He had no one to blame but himself. He read the one house rule and he broke it. He chose this path, but who knew. He wanted to know from Sawn, why him and where are the Slices two daughters.At another round of questioning from Leaf, Sawn finally relented and allowed Mr. Slices to answer the question concerning their two daughters. Mr. Slices would you be so kind to indulge Mr. Cole? Sawn asked.Mr. Slices walked closer to Leaf to allow him to hear clearly. He looked down, directly into Leafs face. Mr. Cole my daughters, Rebecca and Rita are not gone off to school as in the traditional sense. What the hell does that mean? Leaf protested. Mr. Leaf, Sawn interrupted Mr. Slices before he could continue, that is the kind of talk and or behavior we will not tolerate. If you want an answer to your question, we, no I must insist that you reframe from such language as it disrupts the ambience.Thank you, Sam. Mr. Slices acknowledging Sawns curtailing of Leafs outburst. Youre most welcome Bryan. You see the two caskets Mr. Leaf? Bryan continues, as he lifts himself from Leafs face and walked back and forth down the length of the gurney. Therein lies my two daughters, Rita and Rebecca. Leaf automatically assumed the worse, but he didnt ask how nor why. He had no other choice but to assume Bryan had killed them. What else could it be? Here he was, tied up on a gurney smack dab in the middle of what looks like a ritual. Well, hells bells Leaf thought, a ritual of sorts is exactly what it looked like because thats exactly what it was. Bryan turns to Sam, dear brother would you like to continue. Sure. Leaf my boy Bryan and I are brothers. I know we look nothing alike, but it is what it is. Were brothers from different mothers., as the kids say. We dont have the same last name because we have our mothers last name. Leaf could hold it no longer, what in johnny apple seed does that have to do with why Im here on this gurney and why there are two dead girls in caskets?. Mr. Slices found himself tickled at the johnny apple seed thing and laughed out loud. He looked over at Sawn, who didnt find it amusing at all. Leaf, saw the disconnect between the two brothers and explained, Oh I wanted to use more favorable words, but I remember what happened last time. I want someone to tell me whats going on without my having to be taken down memory lane. Leaf exclaimed.Leaf could not believe Sam and Bryan were brothers. He never would have put the two together, they looked nothing alike at all. Sam was a tall man, dressed well while Bryan on the other hand looked like a version of Al Bundy, just shorter. Both brothers were clean shaven. They didnt sound alike at all. They didnt walk alike. This contrast made Leaf wonder so many things, one what in the world did their father and mothers look like. Leaf quickly changed his mind on that question and decided he really did not want to know. It would serve no purpose.Bryan continued, Rita & Rebecca were both born with a rare disease, thats all you need to know about that except, he stopped. Except what Mr. Slices? Leaf asked. It killed them both at different stages of the disease and at different ages. Rebecca is the oldest and she dies at 15. Rita was 14 when she died. Leaf anxiously asked, Was there no cure at all? If there was a cure they would be here, now, wouldnt there? A soft voice climbed up the stairs into the attic, it was Mrs. Slices. For a split-second Leaf forgot he was tied up and his heart skipped a beat. She was indeed a beautiful woman. How in the name of pig knuckles did Bryan ever get her? Leaf came back to himself; did the doctors say there was no cure or was that your assumption? Mrs. Slices took over and begin to explain that each girl starting with the oldest had been to several doctors starting at the age of five. The Slices were assured that none of their other children would be affected by the disease, boy were they wrong. After Rebecca had died the couple decided to have another child believing the second child would be good.Leaf replied, Mrs. Slices I am sorry for your loss but what does that have to do with me Maam? Well Sam was kind enough to find you for this exact day my boy. You will be needed to help transcend our girls back to this world again. All they will need is half of your heart. Rebecca needs the right and Rita needs the left. Leaf begins to squirm about, using all his strength to get free of his restrained. He only found himself tired. My boy no need in that, please reserve your strength. Sam encouraged him.This cannot be happening Leaf thought. What have I done to deserve this, he asked himself? Leaf went back n the recesses of his mind and truly tried to figure out what bad thing had he done to have beenfound so worthy. Worthy? He thought more like so unlucky. He knew he had done some bad. He recalled in church the scripture whatsoever a man sows that he should also reap. Leaf could not recall ever sacrificing someone. What goes around comes around and the saying karma is a B? He again thought I have not been bad enough for this. What surprised Leaf is that the whole time though John, the Slices only son was there in the attic he had said nothing, not one word. Leaf thought that was strange, could this young man be prepared to take anothers life? The Slices and Sam for that matter appeared to be sane. The word in operation however as Leaf thought, was appeared. Everybody appears to be a certain way until. Leaf was pushed into the middle of the room. Sam positioned the two caskets on either side of him. Sam announced that it was time and they had wasted more time than they should have. Sam stepped in between Rebeccas casket and Leaf. He faced the casket and slowly open the top, where the upper body would be seen. Leaf turned to look and there was nothing there. Sam came around and did the same to Ritas casket and again, it too was empty. Leaf could not believe his eyes. What in the Popeye the sailor man was going on? he asked.Leaf was so confused, which made his anxiety even worse. You see son. Were going to cut your heart out and place the right side in Rebeccas coffin and the left in Ritas. Sam told Leaf.NO!!!!! Leaf yelled at the top of his lungs as sweat poured from his face.You cannot do that. Someone back home is going to miss me.Someone is going to miss you too Mr. Sawn. No son, no one will miss me because Im going back home. Sam replied. New York is a big place who will miss you? Sawn asked leaf so self-assured of himself. My family you scum ball! Leaf angrily shouted.Bryan went to the closet and pulled out a face cloth and a bottle of chloroform. He soaked the towel in the chemical. He then turned and walked toward Leaf. Wait!!!! John yelled; I cant let you do this. Do what son? his mother asked. Mother please, John turned and looked into her eyes, We cant do this.John knew even when he first met Leaf what could potentially happen. All Leaf had to do is not open the attic door. It was that small act of doing what he was told of him, that would have saved his life thought John. It had been talked about for years. His parents and uncle firmly believed that the sacrifice of another would bring his sisters back to them. John did not. This ritual had been passed down for generations. It was like a curse, but it wasnt. Any family could perform the ritual, you just had to believe. A boy for girl and vice versa. Leaf was chosen one because he was a boy. But what really got him on that gurney is that he broke the house rules. The ritual required a hardheaded soul and Leaf had that.John could not let it happen. The reason it had taken so long for the ritual to take place was because unlike Leaf all others that had come to rent out the room, they had not broken the house rules. John knew that his parents major problem is that had not grieved, and they just couldnt let go. Uncle Sams only job was to get Leaf there and he did. John knew he had to do something because Leaf did not deserve to be sacrifice and doing se would not bring Rebecca nor Rita back. It would essentially be murder. Mom, Dad, Uncle Sam he doesnt deserve this, as he placed his hand on Leafs shoulder. Leaf laid on the gurney motionless taking everything in. Let him go and let the girls rest in peace. John pleaded with them. He knew he had to say that last part just so they would believe that he believed.NO, weve waited so long, Bryan, said. So long for what, to try and raised the dead? Youve been so busy trying to get someone to open this darn attic door that you forgot you had a live son just waiting for the love and attention youve given two dead daughters. Lucy Slices walked over and slapped John across the face. John regrouped and maintained his stance, Youre not going to hurt Leaf. You need a man take me but not him. You know we cant use you, it has to be a non-relative, Bryan replied.Bryan, John is right, Sam spoke up. The girls are gone and there is nothing we can do about it. Leaf just happens to be a nosey young man.Hes nosey at work and I knew he would be no different here. He could not control himself. His being nosey makes him a good reporter When Sam finished, he walked across the room and stood by John. I cant, we cant let you hurt this young man, banking on a curse that may or may not be true. The girls misfortune is just that misfortune. But harming another wont bring them back, we cant do this. Its time to give yourselves to the one child thats here. He didnt leave, and he needs you too. He needs you both more then the girls ever will. Sam continued with tears in his eyes. Lucy Bryan lets let him go.Leaf can only recall that it was like time stood still before either of them spoke a word.Leaf had one drink two many and the worse of it was mixing it with Chantix. He was warned that it makes you have vivid dreams.He was trying to stop smoking and his doctor prescribed this drug. Man, he thought as he woke up and gathered himself wiping the sleep from his eyes. He knew he had a shot or two or three or four of Tequila last night but didnt think much about it. This morning he had to move and quick. He needed to get to the office, like in an hour in a half. He had to kick butt. The good thing he had semi packed before he went out last night. His Mustang Shelby got him to the office in record time. He also had to thank decent weather and traffic was not bad either. He made it to the office and Mr. Sawn was there ready for him to go, ticket ready, hotel reservations made, camera equipment, ready. Leaf took off to Believe, PA, when he got there at, 7124 Maple Wood Cove, Mr. Bernard & Lauren Slices greeted him."
Voices In Her Head,"Listen...It was two am. The house was quiet. Emma padded down the stairs then checked every window and door on the first floor. She saw the alarm had been activated (by Robert) and let out a sigh of relief.Then she pulled her terry cloth robe tighter before making her way back upstairs.Emma had just gotten back under the down comforter when she heard it again.Listen...Emma shut her eyes tight and placed her hands over both ears. I have to get some sleep tonight. She thought to herself.Why was this happening again?***Twenty five minutes later, Emma was at the medicine cabinet in the master bedroom. She reached for the bottle of melatonin, swallowed two with a mouthful of water before returning to her queen size bed. She turned on her side and let out another sigh.Its either this or pacing the hall again tonight.The trees outside the window danced in a rhythmic way. Emma wasn't sure if it was the graceful way they moved or the melatonin kicking in but soon she would drift off to sleep.***The following morning, after a strong cup of coffee at the breakfast table, she prayed she would feel better today. A robin flew by the kitchen door. Emma admired the beautiful shades of brown on his coat and the deep red of his under belly. Maybe this is a good sign. The voice in her head told her.Emma sipped her coffee. She sat still. Took in the silence of the enormous old Victorian. Soon the house will be bustling with noise. It seemed important to let the calm wash over her. This would soothe her nerves plus get her through the weekend.Emma rose from her chair and set the coffee mug down in the porcelain sink. She reached for a rag (which she kept on the counter)then begun to wipe down the counters.***The children entered the foyer first. Robert must've been gathering their belongings from his SUV. Celina (who was eleven going on fourteen) and Bobby(was eight but small for his age) were fighting the moment they came through the door. Emma left the kitchen in a hurry and greeted them both in the front hall.""Mom, she hit me!"" Bobby wailed.""He had it coming. He took my phone and read my texts messages..."" Celina chimed in.Emma cut her daughter off.""You don't hit your brother! You know how I feel about that.Did you both have a good time?""Celina rolled her eyes while never taking them off the screen of her phone. Bobby was wiggling out of his winter coat. Emma helped him remove his arms.""I did! Dad took me to a baseball game.""""Wow that's great. You must've had fun. Celina, did you go with them?"" Emma inquired.""No, I hate baseball. I stayed at Dads with Allie. I had homework. He said I it was ok.""The front door opened again. Robert( who stood at six foot three) entered. His arms were loaded with a suitcase, a large purple duffel bag plus snacks. He dropped the bags onto the hardwood floor.Celina was heading for the stairs. Bobby was talking so fast, Emma was having trouble keeping up.""Um young lady, these are your things. Come and get them please.""Celina stormed over and lifted her duffel bag over her shoulder. She made a face and puffed out a breath. This didn't phase Robert.""Its heavy."" She complained.""I told you not to bring so much.""Celina lugged it upstairs. Muttering the entire time.""Whose Allie? And why was Celina spending time with her?"""" Hello to you too Emma. I told you about Allie, I've been seeing her for six months now. Celina had work to finish. They weren't really together.""Emma left Robert in the hallway.***Emma made a second cup of coffee along with a peanut butter sandwich for Bobby. Emma offered to heat up leftovers for her ex husband but he declined. She listened to Robert and Bobby discussing the Red Sox game in excruciating detail. They seemed to be reliving it right there at the table. Bobby would light up each time his Dad mentioned a home run or a grand slam. Baseball was something they had always shared.Listen...No. Not now. Leave me alone.Emma told the voice in her head.***Emma turned to face the counter with her coffee mug in her grip. She missed the edge and the mug smashed into pieces all over the tiled floor. Robert jumped up and hurried over to her.He knelt down then started to gather the broken pieces together.""Stay there Bobby! Its ok."" Robert told him.Robert stood up with most of it in his palms. He noticed Emma's hands were shaking. She held tight to the counter. He whispered.""Are you not feeling well again?""""I'm fine. Really I am. I set it too close to the edge, that's all.""Robert took Emma by the hand and led her to the table.""You take it easy. I can sweep that up.""***Emma opened her eyes. The room was bright so she knew it was still early. A blanket lay on top of her. A knock at the door followed by Robert coming into her room. She began to sit up.He walked closer to the bed.""Did I wake you?""""No, I was already up. I promise you I'm fine. I would have canceled if I wasn't.""Robert was along side the bed. Emma smiled at him.""Its quiet. Are they outside or something?""""No, Mrs. Lewis stopped by to see you. When I told her you were asleep, she offered to take them to a movie.""""Oh Robert, this is my weekend. You should have told her no."""" This will give you a chance to tell me what's going on. I look at you and I can see your not right.""""There's nothing wrong with me. You worry too much. I've had some trouble sleeping but last night was better. I swear it. Did you put the alarm on?'He looked confused but nodded anyway.""Emma its me. I need the truth. I wont get mad and the kids can stay. Please, tell me.""Emma sat and refused to answer. Robert placed his hand over hers.""Tell me. Please."""" At first I thought it was someone in the house. I would search every room but found no one. Then I began to check the locks, the alarm, making sure it was always on. But I kept hearing it. A voice always at night. It sounds crazy, I know that. But if its not the TV or a person who broke in... it must be me.""Tears were rolling down Emma's face. She made no attempt to wipe them. Robert gave her hand a gentle squeeze.""How long Emma? When did it start?"""" A few days ago. I'm good during the day. I'm still working on my computer. It happens whenever I don't sleep.""""Have you gone back to Dr. Farber?""""No. It'll stop Robert. It has to. He will change my pills, run tests. I cant go through that...""""But your willing to live like this? No sleep, shaking, hearing voices! You have to go see him. That's not a request. How about today? They wont be back for hours.""""He isn't there late on Saturday. I can go Monday morning.""""That's too long. I want you to go today. I can drive you. Come on get dressed.""***Emma sat in the waiting room. She flipped through pages of a magazine but wasn't able to concentrate. Robert paced behind her chair. ""Will you sit down your making me more anxious!""Robert took a seat on the couch opposite Emma.Emma tossed the magazine on the wooden crate they were using as a side table.""Does it always take this long?""""No, he must be busy. You insisted on coming today.""""Because I care about you and want you to get better.""""No you don't! You like me like this. Helpless and needy. Afraid of my own shadow!""""Stop it Emma. I know what your doing and its not going to work.""""And what am I doing exactly? Come on Robert, tell me I would like you to explain...""The door to the inner office opened and Dr. Farber walked out.""What is going on out here?"" The doctor asked.Emma folded her arms.""We didn't mean to be so loud. I'm sorry. It was my fault.""""Its perfectly alright. Its nobody's fault. Emma I'm ready you can come in."" ***Robert drove the thirty miles by himself. He had left the children with Allie. He took the elevator to the fourth floor. Then he headed down the hall to room 411. He steadied himself before entering the room. Emma was dressed sitting in a chair staring out the window. A nurse named Kelly was placing a small paper cup down on a tray.""Hi, how is she today?"" Robert said.""Not so good. She thought you weren't coming.""""I left late and the traffic was brutal.""Kelly grinned at him and left the two of them alone. Robert brought a chair over and sat beside her. Emma never took her eyes off the trees.""I know I'm late. Boy its warm in here.""Robert unzipped his winter coat. He looked around the room then back at Emma.""I hate that your in here. The kids miss you. But I just don't think they can handle any of this. Bobby will cry I just know it. Emma, will you look at me?""A long drawn out silence.""I miss you too. We use to talk about everything. My job, your writing, the kids, money... I did this to you. This is my fault. You needed me and I was never ever there for you. I left you alone in that big old house.""Robert wipes the tears away from his eyes.""I'm so sorry. I want you to know that. You have nothing to worry about. Just get strong. I got the kids. They really are a handful sometimes. But I wouldn't trade them for anything. All you have to do is get better. Please, please get better. Come back to us.""Emma turns from the window and touches Roberts hand. He is stunned.""Hey, you wanna take a walk with me?""Emma rises from the chair. He smiles at her.""I would really like that."" Emma says."
My Mother's Song,"Sunlight filtered in through the window. It scattered from wall to wall giving warmth to the cold, dusty air. I stood in the doorway, watching as the dust mites sparkled in the light and settled on my former belongings. My bed was situated right where it always had been. Pressed up against the far wall and wrapped in warm striped blankets and sheets. My desk was beside it, still carrying my piggy bank and white lamp. My posters were all hung up and the cloth ribbons draped around the ceiling. The window still shone on the far wall where, underneath it, glowing from the refracted sunlight, sat my piano. The wood was splintered and scratched but it welcomed me like a childhood friend. I walked over to the piano pressing into the soft carpet underfoot. The bench creaked as I sat down. I swept my hands over the aged wood. It rippled with my touch. Absorbing the warmth from my fingertips. I felt the grooves of my carved name on the right side. LIZZY. I traced each letter. The world was beginning to dissolve. I lifted the cover revealing the polished ivory. I placed my hands down gingerly. The keys felt soft. My muscles relaxed and without command or thought I began playing. The sweet melody began. My head began to swim. The peaceful comfort of the song set my mind dancing. The world completely dissolved. I was no longer at the piano. I was sitting on my bed watching my mother play. Her hands flowed through the air. The world gave no resistance to her playing. It welcomed it with open arms. My mom looked over at me and with sparkling eyes told me the same story she told me every night. The notes continued melting together as she spoke.This song is special Lizzy. Do you know why it's special? She asked me. I knew the answer, but I let her keep talking. I loved hearing the story every night. When I was a little girl, I used to get bad dreams. I would wake up in the middle of the night and run to grandma. I would cry and cry until I crawled into bed with her and fell asleep. I kept having these dreams every night until one night grandma sat down at the piano next to my bed. She told me to listen to her song. She said it was a magical song. That as long as I heard it before going to sleep nothing could hurt me. She played the most beautiful song, she played it for me every night, and I never had another bad dream. Now I play it for you little Lizzy. So, I know that youll be safe just like I was. I sat on my bed and listened believing with my whole heart every word my mom told me. I laid back and closed my eyes. The blend of notes fluttered through my thoughts like a soft breeze inside my head. I knew I was completely safe. The song eventually ended painting the room with a brilliant peaceful white. I opened my eyes one more time to see my mom leave the room saying, I love you, Lizzy and with nothing left to stop me, I drifted into a peaceful sleep. 				The memory gently faded to the recessions of my mind. The present house formed around me again. My hands had stopped playing. Tears were rolling down my cheeks sparkling briefly before splashing on the keys. My mom would never play the song for me again. The thought was too painful to bear. A deep longing gaped in the pit of my stomach. I forced myself to play the song again but my hands resisted. The notes sounded awkward. The beautiful atmosphere my mom created was gone. The room felt cold. I begged my memory to take me away again but the notes I shot from the piano bore nothing more than sound. I wanted to scream. I threw my hands up to my face. The song stopped. The last notes rang out leaving nothing but silence behind. My body froze as I sat there. A pulsing frequency pounded my brain. My head felt as if it was falling into an infinite abyss. The world began to melt to black. Everything was disappearing. I sat there motionless losing track of time. The sun slowly fell taking its warmth and glow in the room as it went. The moon rose taking its place. Sending its ghostly haze to illuminate the room. I kept my eyes covered until I heard the steady rhythm of droplets cascading down the roof. I opened my eyes and out the window saw the pour of grey against the moonlight. The great roar of the rain pressed softly against my ears. The world began to reform. I wiped my eyes and placed my hands on the keys again. Comforted by the white noise of the rain I began to play. My hands moved without tension. The melody and bass collided and burst with energy whirling about the room. It fluttered to every corner and granted warmth to everything it touched. The piggy bank and lamp brightened. The light blue paint swirled and danced to the music. The bed sang with the tune it had heard so many times before. I continued playing and lifted my head to look out the window. I saw the energy from the song cut through the rain. Touching every raindrop, every leaf, every blade of grass until the outside began to sing to the melody of my moms song. The music drifted up into the atmosphere. Brightening the night sky. I stretched my neck to look up at the stars. Each seemed to twinkle with the rhythm. At last, the song reached the moon. Brightening its haze covering everything with a brilliant peaceful white. A light smile appeared on my face. The song truly was magical. I finished the song and sat in the atmosphere I had created. My mom might be gone but her magic is still with me. I got up from the piano and walked to the doorway and before stepping out I turned around and said one final thing. I love you, Mom."
"Rise Up, Rise Up.","Listen Mark, it is really simple. Either use the hydrogen peroxide or dont, the choice is yours.Mark blanched slightly, wavered momentarily, grabbed the brown bottle, carefully looked at the label and began reading.Perhaps it wouldnt be as bad as he imagined.Purified water -checkHydrogen peroxide 3% - checkDirections: clean the affected area. Apply a small amount of product 1-3 times a day. - checkWARNING: KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.-no problemFor external use only- checkHmmmm, Mark pondered, perhaps Ginnys request wasnt that bad an idea after all. It had be quite awhile since hed had sex with anyone and the only person whod handled his penis in quite some time was his doctor and...himself.For Ginny it had been 30 years since shed last had her hands on a penis or had one enter any of her orifices.She was somewhat reluctant to break her abstinence and yet there was something about Mark that sorely tested her resolve to leave the damned things alone.Ginny had been married twice and so had developed an up close and personalrelationship with each husband's genitals.Her first husband, a Dutchman, was not very fastidious about cleaning his apparatus.Ginny was young and rather innocent and several years younger than her domineering partner. She really had no idea that his demands for sex were anything she could control and asking him to bath first was unimaginable to her.He wasnt a very generous lover and once his needs were satisfied, grunted with satisfaction, rolled off Ginny and fell sound asleep.The act itself held some pleasure for her, but for the most part became a tedious task of enduring his efforts to achieve orgasm.She knew exactly how many holes were in each of the ceiling tiles above her head.Good sex had her hole count under 1000. Anything after that she simply zoned out from the experience and began planning how she could get the ice cream out of the freezer without Tony waking up.Their marriage didnt last very long and she was grateful for the respite from the endless vaginal infections suffered from exposure to his rather unhygienic washing habits.After they separated, she lost a lot of weight, began drinking heavily and played the bar scene rather ruthlessly.It was the early 1970s and the free exchange of sexual activity was not as frowned upon as it had been in her earlier years.Ginny began to experiment. She rather enjoyed the process and decided perhaps penis werent as bad as shed imagined.The problem was that, like her drinking, one never seemed to be enough.So, after a year of experimenting she decided to quit. Shed kept careful tabs of the number of encounters and had managed to keep the count down to the digits on her hands. She knew if she began on her toes, that she would never stop and that a dim future was in store for her.So with firm resolve, she made a number of changes in her life.She joined a religion that forbade its members to use alcohol and other drugs, frowned upon the use of tobacco and had strict laws regarding the guarding of ones chastity. NO SEX UNLESS MARRIED.In one foul swoop, Ginny solved several problems. The biggest task in front of her was...to find a husband, thus ensuring her chances of once again having access to a penis.Well, as shed managed to keep her weight down, she found the perfect candidate.A good Catholic boy, who though had a history of promiscuous behaviour was agreeable to settling down to marriage and begin a family with Ginny.He had a very nice penis and an admirable grasp of how to use it.They were quite happy for several years, produced 3 children and though the seeds of destruction were present, Ginny failed to observe carefully. She hid much and so did her husband Joe.Their marriage ended in catastrophe, with Ginny licking her wounds for several years, vowing to be much more careful in future attempts to handle any male apparatus.Somehow the years passed. It wasnt that she was adverse to having another relationship, she just was extremely cautious.She sorely missed having a penis in her life but managed to find other substitutes and somehow, she came to discover that a penis, detached from a body, gave as much pleasure as one on a body. The added bonus was that her lovely latex lover was much easier to clean and made very few demands upon her time once its job was accomplished.Over the years, she made several attempts to seriously check out the market.In her late 60s, she met a delectable male, who smelled deliciously like butterscotch. She did her best to entice him to have sex with her, but for some unknown reason he was reluctant to enter fully into the game. She tried for several years to tempt him and finally gave up, believing that she was destined to spend her remaining years penis free.In her early 70s, she once again was tempted.She met Mark in the alley behind her apartment. She was out in her garden when he wandered by, stopped to chat and they struck up an immediate friendship.Mark was only 55 and though Ginny felt the magnetism of sexual attraction to him, managed to subdue any carnal inclinations with the realization that he could be her child. Unfortunately, the feelings she began to have for him were anything but maternal.They managed to make it to her bed, she emerged after 1 hour and he several hours later.It had begun quite innocently with her offering to give him a massage and check out what was going on with his kidney.One thing ledto another, she finished the treatment, covered his snoring body witha warm blanket and tiptoed out of the room and into her kitchen to continue on with her baking.When Mark appeared in the doorway several hours later, he announced that hed had the best sleep hed had in ages. He was amazed that hed been out that long.Ginny smiled, she knew full well the powers of her bed and shared them with very few. To date, her grandchildren and on occasion, her grown daughter, were the only human beings whod been allowed to experience themiraculous healing powers of her magic pallet.Her relationship with Mark expanded. She eventually informed him of her NON maternalistic feelings towards him and he seemed quite comfortable with the idea of advancing to another level.The end came when she informed him of her requirements to have sex with her.Mark was at first reluctant, but soon warmed to the plan and agreed to the conditions.Ginny, in the meantime, was having second thoughts.She valued her independence highly and was reluctant to enter into any relationship that interfered with that.It wasnt that she was adverse to having a sexual relationship, only that she was hesitant to deal with all the baggage that came with it.She left Mark her phone number and said to call her in a few days.Somehow, she wasntsurprised when the call never came.Life went on much as before. She began dreaming of herds of penis roaming freely across the range in search of refuge from the storm. She painted a few, sculpted a few and had a lot of fun with her faithful companion, Victor, a lovely pink latex vibrator that was always up to an adventure and rarely failed to do the job at hand. Best of all - he went into a drawer when the job was done...AFTER being cleaned with hydrogen peroxide.Many more years passed.Ginny may or may not have found more live penis and yet her life was complete and filled each day with adventure after adventure.She woke daily with a deep sense of gratitude for having been given such a bountiful life and before her feet hit the ground, humbly begged her Higher Power to show her the best direction for the day and the strength to carry out His plans.Came the day she never woke up to this plane of existence.Shed gone to bed early and strangely enough, her final thoughts had been of Mark and the lovely hours theyd spent together those many years before.The last thing she remembered was looking at the hydrogen peroxide on her bedside table and sighing with satisfaction remembering her recent romp with her honey, Victor.The next thing she knew, she was in front of a beautiful set ofpearly gates.The Great One hovered before her, smiling lovingly as He welcomed her inside.She bowed her head as He said, Listen Ginny, Im going to make an exception in your case and allow you to bring ONE of your earthly possessions inside.Gin looked down and lo and behold, at her feet was..."
The Old Man,"Listen. Im going to tell you a story. There once was an old man who lived by himself in a dark forest. He hated water in large quantities and so lived in a place where the only water came from shallow pans scattered around his property. Every morning he walked to the poplar tree and carried the blue tin bowl inside. After making a weak rust colored tea, he would splash the remaining water over his head and sprinkle a little bit over his armpits. At night, he walked to the spruce tree and carried the yellow plastic bowl inside. For food, he ate tinned green beans and instant mashed potatoes. For entertainment, he had a portable hand-cranked radio that when the skies were clear received two stations very clearly and one station muffled by static. He wasnt stupid, this old man, he was willing to suffer a little but not too much to humor his madness. Theres a lesson in there for you. A boy came upon the shack. He knocked on the door and the door didnt open. The old man was listening to the radio and his eyes were closed, he might have been sleeping. On the table was a half-eaten bowl of white mush. The radio was playing Spanish jazz. Old man! The boy shouted.The old man opened his eyes and then closed it again.Old man! The boy shouted and for good measure kicked the door. The door opened, the old man stood shirtless in the doorway. Put some clothes on, the boy said. He came in and turned off the radio. While the old man was digging through a pile of rags in the corner, the boy took out a long oblong shape wrapped in brown butcher paper from the plastic bag he was carrying.The old man put on a dirty white shirt and tried to use his hands to smooth out the wrinkles. Here, eat this, the boy said.I just ate, the old man said.Eat this, the boy said. So the old man did. He unwrapped a hunk of meat from the butcher paper. Sprinkling some oil on a cast iron pan, he fried the entire thing and ate it without salt or bread. The boy sat by him turning the now useless buttons on the radio. They didnt talk, the only sound was from fork hitting plate, knife sawing through flesh, ill fitting dentures chewing on tough gristle. Clean up, the boy said after the old man was done. So the old man went outside and buried the butcher paper under the spruce tree, the fork and knife under the poplar. When he came back the boy was already gone. The old man should have been relieved but he wasnt. The next day a man knocked on the door which promptly opened to reveal the old man standing in the doorway in a yellowed shirt and frayed black pants. There was a strong smell of onions and must. All people who live alone have to be vigilant against this odor but the old man had ceased to notice it for a long time now, or perhaps he had ceased to care. It is hard to tell the difference with him sometimes. Hello sir, may I come in? The man asked. The two of them sat down at the kitchen table, the man sitting where the boy sat yesterday.How are you doing sir? The man asked.Well enough, the man said.I heard that he came to see you yesterday.He did come yesterday, but only for a short while.Did he bring anything with him?Nothing but some meat. It was good meat.What did he bring it in? If you were listening, you would remember that the old man wasnt stupid, he wasnt going to tell this man anything important. I dont remember, he said, some bag, its not here now, he must have taken it back with him.The man nodded, he seemed to have been expecting this answer because he smiled. How do you get water out here? The man asked. The old man explained his system. The man asked more questions: why did the old man hate large bodies of water so much, where had he come from, what was his youth like? The old man talked and talked and talked until his tongue numbed and his words came out slurred and syncopated. I would love to see your property, the man said. The old man wasnt stupid, he wasnt going to show this man anything important. Its nothing, he said, nothing but trees.What kind of trees? The old man described the beauty and variety of the temperate rainforest where poplars, spruces and birches came together to live in harmony in a damp and misty atmosphere. Theres no place like this in the world, he said, I fell in love with the sound of my own movements. I love trees, the man said. I used to climb apple trees when I was younger. The old man said he used to climb trees as well, and broke a few bones doing so. They compared broken bones. The old man got up and showed the man a long scar on his side. They talked for a long time. When it got dark, the man shook the old mans hand and left. The old man should have been relieved but he wasnt. The next morning, expecting a visitor, he used water from the blue tin bowl to wash his shirts and pants. While they laid damp and drying on a chair, he sat naked and shivering at the kitchen table. Someone knocked on the door. Open up, I know youre in there! He sipped his rust colored tea and waited. The knocking continued for a couple of minutes and then it stopped. The old man touched the sleeve of his shirt, still damp, a couple more hours to go.The knocking started up again. The old man turned his head, as if listening to a far away noise."
Pitbully,"The pure breeds dominated the side of the schoolyard the bleachers were on.On the top of the stack of six long benches, a large Pitbull terrier sat with his buddies.Fat Freddy, a Bassett hound, said to the pit, Hey Conan, get a loada the new pup?Hes so mutt Im gonna call him Heinzhiyuck hiyuck! 		Frenchie La Pooch, a black French Bulldog, elbowed Fat Freddy in his jiggling girth and said, Thats such an old one dude!Give it up. 		They looked over at Conan because he remained silent, which was so unlike him.Without a word, Conan got up.He was Fat Freddys size but all brindle coated muscle.Pointy ears erect, he lumbered down two benches and sat next to Dionne, a pretty Jack Russell terrier in a pale green dress.She was chatting with a bouncy-coated apricot poodle. 		Conan said, Hey Dionne.Can I walk you home from school today?		Dionnes lip curled.She said, Id rather eat peas out of a litterbox.		Conan looked confused.He wasnt the biggest pup in the school, but he was the strongest.Also, the meanest.Being confused made him feel stupid.  		Three shih tzu sisters in matching pink dresses giggled and whispered from the bottom bench. The one with grey ears gave him googly eyes.He ignored her; she was always available.He looked up at his friends.They were staring at him, waiting for his next move. 		Conan decided to do the new mutt a favor and let him know who the alpha dog of the school was.That would make him feel better. 		The pup sat alone under a majestic maple tree in the front yard, halfway between the bleachers and the cafeteria windows.He was reading a textbook. 		What a nerd! scoffed Conan as he sauntered over.He strode like a body builder pumping iron in a gym. 		The studying pup ignored Conans approach.Conan glanced at the bleachers to make sure the pure breeds were watching his display of authority.They were. The mixed breeds avoided the bleacher side of the yard, but a few peeked out the cafeteria windows.A tiny chihuahua-fox terrier mix shivered uncontrollably and peed a couple of drops.  		Hey mutt!Im the boss dog here, got it?! He knocked the heavy textbook into the dirt.		The little pup flinched but stood and looked up at the pit anyways. Okay by me.Ill do my best to stay out of your way.		Conans eye narrowed. You tryin ta be funny?		The scruffy grey pup said, No. 		Not knowing what else do, Conan shoved the little pup to the ground, then stomped away, feeling hed made his point. 		The little dog got up, brushed himself off and picked up his book.A fluffy white mutt his size had materialized next to him as if beamed down from the Enterprise.		Hey.You stood up to Conan.Cool.Maybe stupid.But cool.Im Airy.Short for Aristotle, talk about a nerd name huh?Airy was a poowawa, by the look of him.He had one caramel colored ear and wore thick rimmed glasses.He also carried a book.Whatchoo readin? 		Math.Pretty dorky right?Im Reese.This is my first day.		Airy laughed and showed Reese his own textbook, it was a biology book.That bully is Conan.		Hes a A stereotype.		Ha ha! Right you are!		The bell rang then. 		Reese said, Wanna come over after school?Since its my first day, my mom said shed make special treats.Puffed liver are her specialty. 		Airy said, Sure!Meet here after last bell? *** 		At three oclock the new friends met at the maple tree.They walked towards the road. 		Hi guys! 		Airy and Reese jumped a foot in the air.It was Dionne, lovely as ever with her big chocolate eyes and enchanting chestnut spots.Can I walk with you?Were headed the same way.		Uh, uh, uh said Airy.		Reese noodged him in the arm to unstick a skipping record.		Airy snapped back to life, Of course! 		The three dogs walked.They talked about math, and biology, and horror movies.After six blocks, Dionne said, This is my street!See you dawgs tomorrow!She loped down the street, graceful as a gazelle. 		Reese said, She likes you.		Airy shrugged, Aww I dunnoshes never spoken to me before.		Well, why didnt you ever talk to her?		Shes a pure breed!		So.She talked to you first then.Doesnt that make you feel like a dumbass?		Airy said, Yeah.Kind of.I just figured shed diss me.		Reese said excitedly, Cmon! Theres my house at the end! 		He stopped walking when he realized Airy was standing stone still with his mouth open.His fur was risen in tufts down his back.		Dude, youre catching flies.		Airy shook his muppetty white fur back into place and said, Thats The Lost Pets House.		Reese said, Its just a house. Um,  house.		Airy said, There was a pet cemetery there, a long time ago, like, maybe 20 years.Human years, so more like, ummmm He looked up with a paw to his chin, thinking.Then he said, Like 180 years. Hurricane Henry caused a landslide and the whole property was buried.The landowner sold the valuable land without disclosing the cemetery remains.The new owners built that house.They sold it after six months.Its been sold and bought again and again with no explanation why.Airy licked his lips nervously.		Sheesh.Only dummies like Conan believe in ghosts!Cmon!lets get some treats! 		Airy guessed that made sense.Plus, he was dying of curiosity. *** 		Inside the turreted two-story house, Reese showed Airy around.Upstairs, he pointed out his dads office (nap room), moms sewing room, two closets, and a bathroom.Then he said, My rooms the last one at the end of the hall, its the best! 		Before the bedroom door was a third closet door. 		Airy said, Whats in there?		I dunno.Its locked.Theres no keyhole, and it opens from the inside so Dad cant take off the hinges.He doesnt want to break it down.Reese shrugged.We dont need another closet.		Reese opened the door to his room, the master bedroom of the house, and Airy gawped in wonder.Duuude.So cooool!		It was a huge, airy room with a high, open rafter ceiling, 600 sq ft of floorspace and bookshelves to the ceiling.Airy stood on the green shag rug in the center and looked around.At last, he said, My man, you need to have a Halloween party here!		Really?		Totally!Everyone from school will come.This is The Lost Pets House!Mua ha ha ha! *** 		Halloween was two weeks away. 		The weekend before, the two friends had a sleepover.They made decorations for the party.After supper they finished the invitations and retired to Reeses room for a scary movie on Hulu.They settled on an old but beloved classic- Poltergeist. 		Airy fell asleep before the end as usual but woke up later having to pee. A noise arose in the hallway.  He shook his sleep-foggy head and listened.Silence.He must have imagined it. He thought. 		He closed the darkened screen of the laptop.They were rolled in blankets on the floor  campout style. He got up and went to the door.He looked back at the sleeping, softly snoring lump, and changed his mind about waking him.He was a big pup; he could go to the bathroom by himself. 		Nothing was in the hallway, and all was dark and quiet.Faint moonlight in a rectangle shape down the hall indicated the bathroom. It was the only open door.He crept as quietly as he could, alert for any sound.In the bathroom he peed, leaving the door open so he could listen for the disturbing noise. 		He flushed the toilet.Through the roaring sound of the water swirling, he thought he heard it.  		 It was coming towards him from down the hall!Airy imagined a huge mis-shapen figure- a monster- dragging a gnarled appendage behind it. Or a body.  		The toilet finished flushing and all was silent again.He stood in the doorway, then peaked around the frame.Nothing there. 		All quiet, all dark. 		There was a faint blue light down the hall just before Ernies door.It was coming from under the locked door. 		He stepped out into the hallway and the light blinked off.He tip-toed to the door.He heard a click from the other side.He tried the doorknob.It was as solidly locked as always.He raced to Ernies room and closed the door behind him. He lay awake in the dark, shivering like a chihuahua in a snow stormfor a long time.He cursed his over-active imagination.A long time later, he slept. 		In the morning, he told Reese of the noise and the light, afraid his pal wouldnt believe him.But Ernie said, I believe you.You wouldnt make up stories just to scare me.I wish youd woken me up. 		Airy said, I feel badly that I didnt, but the noises were there for a bit, then gone, both times. Are you gonna tell your folks about this?		No way!I dont wanna move again!I like it here, despite Spuds and his dumb friends.Besides, if the ghost or whatever it is meant to harm us, it would have done something by now.		Well, we sure have the right place for a Halloween Party! *** 		The next Saturday night, as it was getting dark, Reese finished lighting the candles in the jack-o-lanterns outside. He filled a metal tub with water and placed two dozen green apples in it.He cued up the first of many spooky-themed songs on his iTunes.His computer screen silently displayed A Nightmare on Elm Street.He lowered the lights and scattered fifty battery operated candles around the room.  		Airy poured sodas and red juices into a punch bowl on the desk.He tasted it.Delicious. 		Ernies mom was delighted her son had made friends and eagerly offered to make food.There were liver puffs, pigs in blankets, and peanut butter cookies with orange and black frosting.Ernie scattered bowls of Halloween candy all around the room. 		Reese wore a white disco suit, fang extensions over his real fangs, and had used his moms makeup to whiten his face.He was Disco Dracula.Airy had wrapped himself top to bottom in dirty torn sheets and wore a green bow tie.He wore his glasses over the eyeholes.He was Nerd Mummy. 		Dionne showed up early, dressed in a khaki jumpsuit with an African safari hat and fake buck teeth.Im an archeologist! she exclaimed.She told Airy, I heard you were going as a mummy.She winked out from thick rimmed glasses. 		Ernies parents were banished to the living room downstairs.They handed out candy to little trick or treaters and showed the costumed guests the way upstairs to the party. 		Next to come were the three snobby girls.They were dressed like the three witches from Eastwick. The shih tzu dressed like the Cher-witch giggled and said, We just  to see your house!The Lost Pets House. Wooooow! 		Reese said, Welcome you guys, cmon in! 		Behind the little witch sisters came a horde of ten more guests. 		After an hour or so, the room was packed with costumed young dogs eating and drinking.A German Shepard dressed as a wizard danced with a corgi mix in a skeleton suit. Some pups bobbed for apples, betting Jack Links on the winners.In one corner, an old-fashioned game of  was in progress, it growled when stuck with a tail.Winners received Amazon gift cards. 		As Reese was refilling the punch bowl, the shih tzu dressed as the blond Eastwick-witch said, I noticed you read a lot. She giggled.The once annoying sound was suddenly as pretty as bird song. Im Bitsy but I hate that name, call me Bee.		I thought you liked Spuds? Reese said questioningly.		Yuck-no!Hes so dumb!Mitzy is the one who has the crush!Bee shrugged and added, I only dig smart dogs.		Reese was surprised.Curiously, he asked her, What do you want to be when you grow up?		Bee said, Well, an astronaut of course!Giggles tinkled out her mouth.She added, Who wouldnt want that! Dont laugh!		He didnt, instead he asked, Whats your favorite subject?		Bee didnt hesitate, Science of course, silly.She giggled.He was beginning to like that giggle a lot.		Whats your favorite book? he asked.		Hey! No fair!My turn now whos your favorite philanthropist?		He was shocked by the depth of her mind.I never really thought about it before.I would say anyone who supports animal protection organizationswhat about you?		She said, Elon Musk.		He realized she wasnt a fluff-head.She had goals and was actually smart.		The doorbell rang again. 		It was nearly midnight. Who would come so late? 		After a couple of minutes heavy feet clambered up the stairs.		It was Spuds, Fat Freddy, and Blackie Le Pooch.		. 		Conan was Alex from his pals, the Droogs. 		Conan said, Guess our invites must have got lost in the mail or something.		Airy had come to Reeses side and said sarcastically, Yeah, that must have been it.		Reese said, We didnt mean to hurt your feelings		Airy snorted and said to Reese, What feelings?		Fat Freddy said, Whatever. Wheres the food?		Frenchie said, Bring on da girls!		Two giggling shih tzu sisters took him by the arms, one on each side.In unison they said, Cmon Frenchie, lets play truth or dare. 		Conan said, Thats a great idea!He had a wicked look on his blocky face.Reese groaned inside.He could only imagine the embarrassing truths and un-nerving dares.But he was determined to be the cool, calm host and had everyone sit in a circle on the floor. 		Airy passed out numbers on papers to the twelve remaining guests.The other dogs had midnight curfews and had gone home. In a jar painted black with a skull, he dropped in the same number of folded papers. 		Im the biggest.I go first. Said Conan.		Reese rolled his eyes but didnt argue over something so trivial.He passed the jar to the Pitbull who then plucked a number.Number four.		Airy groaned and lifted a paw with trepidation.Ill choose dare.		Conan thought for a minute then said, I dare you to walk across that beam.He pointed up to the twelve-foot ceiling. 		Dione said, Oh come on!Hell break his neck!		Airy said to her, Ill be fine.No biggee.		Fat Freddy and Frenchie cleared the bowls of food and drink from the desk and pushed it out from the window, so it was under the beam. 		Airy climbed up onto it from the desk.He was very nimble.Halfway across he said, Piece of cake!		Conan threw an apple at his head.		Airys arms circled crazily for balance.The crowd gasped.		He fell!He thumped to the floor on his side, then rolled over onto his back while rubbing his elbow.Im okay.Just bruised. He said shakily.		You are such a jerk!Both Reese and Dionne said in unison.Conan guffawed along with his buddies.The shih tzus glared at the mean dogs.		My turn. Said Airy, sitting up and scootching back into the circle.		Conan passed the jar to him.It was number two, Dionnes number.		She said, Truth.		Airy didnt hesitate, he asked her, Would you like to go to the Christmas Dance with me?		She didnt hesitate either, Yes!Then she said, My turn.She picked number seven.Reese.		Reese said, Truth.		Dionne asked him, Have you seen or heard any ghosts in this house. 		You could have heard a pin drop, no one breathed.Reese said, No. 		When Reese picked a number he said, Number eleven.		It was Conan.He said, Ill pick dare.		Reese looked at Airy.Airy nodded imperceptively.Reese said, I dare you to walk to the end of the hallway and back.In the dark, no lights.		Conan laughed, Thats stupid!		Mitzy said, Awww, no fair, hes getting off too easy---		Airy shushed her.		Conan got up and sauntered to the door.He opened it and went out into the hallway.Reese closed his bedroom door to immerse the hall in darkness.All twelve dogs put their ears to the door, straining to hear.Footsteps faded to silence.Then out of the silence the footsteps grew louder again.They stopped. 		A minute passed.Then fiveten. The pups looked at each other.He should have been back ages ago. Said Bee.		Open the door.Said Dionne.		Reese opened it a crack and peeked out.		Eerie blue light flooded the hall six feet from his door.The closet door was open.He pushed his door open wider and the closet door slammed shut. The dogs jumped.The girls screamed. 		Was that Conan? asked Frenchie.All the dogs whod seen the light shook their heads. 		The closet door opened.Only darkness inside.Then a paw thudded to the floor out of the opening, out of the dark.Then another.They were white as fresh snow.The paws scrabbled on the wood floor, leaving Monster-can scratches.Conan crawled into the hallway.His entire coat was ghost white; he was drooling.He had peed all over his legs.		His buddies got him up on his feet and dragged his limp, panting body into Reeses room. 		Im sorry.So sorry.SorryHe muttered between shudders. *** 		Monday at school Fat Freddy asked Frenchie, Wheres Conan? Frenchie shrugged.		They found him in the library with his nose in a textbook."
A BEDTIME STORY,"""OK kids, snuggle up and Gramps will tell you a story. Don't need no books. This story is sitting right here is this old head of mine. It happened to me right back then when I was knee-high to a grasshopper. Never forgotten it and I never will, not until they put me in a box in the churchyard,next to your Grandma. Well,it started out a normal enough day. I was up and about good and early and there was no hope of breakfast yet,so I opened the back door quietly and went off down the yard to use the outhouse. None of your fancy en- suites in those days or even indoor plumbing.It was just about light enough to see,if I left the door hanging open a crack. Light enough to have a quick check for spiders or snakes before sitting down to do my business. When Icame out there was still no smell of cooking from the kitchen so I took it into my head to go foraging . It was early in the season but I'd spotted some juicy looking berries the day before. It was mushroom season too and I knew how good a plate of eggs and field mushrooms would go down.  The sun was doing its best to rise, but big grey clouds were gathering faster than the cobwebs collecting in the corners. Your great- grandma never was much of a one for cleaning above eye level. Anyway it looked like rain was on it's way so I thought I'd best get a wriggle on. I set off out the yard and down the lane and my bare feet sent up little puffs of dust from the parched ground. Pretty soon I came to the bramble patch andstuffed my mouth with berries until the juice ran down my chin. Anyone passing would've thought I was half starved. To tell the truth my stomach was feeling pretty hollow and I kept thinking of the great breakfast I'd be getting if I found those mushrooms. I climbed the fence into the wood and set off to the shady spot where I knew the mushrooms would be, if only the squirrels hadn't found them first. The sky was getting darker and there was a distant rumble of thunder. A few drops of rain fell but the trees still had most of their autumn leaves and I wassheltered from the worst. My luck was in. Clustered on the bank were a dozen or so field mushrooms. I pulled them carefully, leaving the roots to carry on growing for another day. That was when I realised I had nothing to carry them in, so I whipped off my shirt and tied them into a bundle,leaving me in just my raggy shorts. The rain was coming down heavier now so I figured to get back home as fast as I could run. As I left the shelter of the trees I was soaked through in seconds. I scrambled over the fence and that's when I first noticed it.The sky was melting. You ever done one of those water colour paintings where you get the paper really wet then let the coloursrun down and spread out?Well that's what seemed to be happening. Where there had been thick grey cloud, a mist of colours appeared across the sky and ran slowly downwards. At the same time they spread sideways so the colours mingled into a curtain of reds, blues and yellows.The more it rained the more the colours intermingled and now I could seegreens, purples and oranges too. As I stood,I couldn't hardly bear to look around, the sight was so dazzling. Then it dawned on me that the display wasn't stopping with the sky. The colours of the trees started to disolve and theautumn leaves added their fieryhues.The wash darkened as the browns of the trunks and branches changed the palette .The shapes of the trees disappeared as I stared in amazement. A terrible thought struck me. I turned around. Where our house had stood was just a growing smudge of smoky grey. I looked down to find I was standing in a rapidly deepening puddle of water. It was that ugly shade that you get when you mix every colour in the paint box, with an oily slick of rainbow colours swirling on the top. Desperately I turned round and round trying to find a solid object in this meltingworld. There was only me, a tiny, terrifiedl figure, in a fading mass of ever changing colour. I wondered if I was going to wash clean away along with the rest of my universe. I looked at my arm. A drop of rain splashed onto it and for a moment I thought my skin was starting to turn transparent. I wondered what my bones would look like once all my outside had faded away. The mud coloured water was up to my skinny knees and rising. Perhaps I would drown before I had time to find out.  Suddenly I was aware of a warm wind, like I was standing under one of those blow dryers . The rain slowed to a drizzle then the odd drop. As it stopped the wind seemed to wrap round my shivering body and ruffled my hair. I held my arms out and they looked tanned and covered with bramble scratches. I saw that my shorts had a new tear and thought that my Ma would give me hell when she saw it. Then I remembered. Ma was gone, along with Pa and our house and all the rest of my world. Perhaps it was the wind, but, I can tell you,my eyes teared up and Iwas fair set to start howling. Somehow though, the wind felt like a warm pair of arms hugging me tight and I felt safe, like when Ma hugged me goodnight. I clung on to that feeling and blinked the tears away. The wind kept right on blowing and the water I was standing in started to soak away, until Iwas standing in nothing more than a muddy puddle. Like a film running backwards the colours began to spread outwards and upwards and, after a while I could make out the shapes of familiar objects, like I was looking through a thick fog. The trees became trunks then gradually the trunks grew branches and the glorious autumn foliage reappeared. I hardly dared look round but, by the time I'd summoned up my courage, there was the wonderful shape of our house. It was still a bit fuzzy round the edges but as I watched the wind blew the last traces of cloud away and up into the sky. The colours spread and seperated and formed into a glorious rainbow arching across a pale blue sky. I grabbed my shirt full of mushrooms and ran down the lane as fast as I could. As I neared the house I smelled the heavenly aroma of cooking. Pancakes and eggs. The mushrooms would be just in time to add to the feast. I flew in the door and Ma swept me up in a giant hug.  "" What were you thinking of, going out there in that cloud burst?"" she scolded, "" and what have you done to those shorts?"". I hugged her and hung on to her real tight. "" You'resoaked through! What have you been doing out in this cloud burst?"" she asked."" Oh, nothing much. Just collecting mushrooms."" I poured my treasure onto the table and in minutes Ma had them sizzling away in a pan of lard. I've never enjoyed a breakfast so much in the whole of my life."
The Bearer of Rainbow and Rain,"CW: suicidal thoughtsFrank Dove was staring at the sky for the last ten minutes. He was sitting on a slab made of steel on the top floor of the 26-story building. Few drops emerged from his eyes and rolled over his cheek. He then looked at his palms, maybe, trying to find the unfaithful fate line due to which he was in that situation, so alone on the floor of a high raised building if he jumped from there then the demise of him was sure. His life was miserable unto this point, and he was sure that his life would be more miserable ahead. He had been always normal in every aspect of life. He always minded his own business, not meddling with others. Still, this stage of life befell him. He had always been one of those guys who helps others, even if the other guy is rude to him on previous occasions. He always had a heart of gold, but when the time came, no one helped him in his sticky situations.The sore point in his life was his inability to lie, but as an insurance agent, his superior always forced him to lie to clients. He had always found some way so that he might not need to lie and evade the situation with clients following honest paths, but since the last two claims, he could not find other ways around. The company had to pay in full the last two insurance claims which resulted in his decreased rating before his boss, Rave Ronson. Rave was over fifty years, a little stout man. He had a perfect score of denying all the insurance claims coming before him, so he became superior soon after joining the job. He had warned Frank not to settle further claims unfavourably for the company otherwise he would get a pink slip. But he soon got another insurance claim where the husband died in an accident and the wife needed money badly as she had no job and two daughters to care for.The same hopeless situation extended to his personal life as well. His honesty has resulted in him being separated from his wife Melina Dove. Melina took their only son with her. Melina was an attorney in a private firm where she had an affair with her boss, and she went to live with him.These two incidents within a weak were the reason of him shattered to the core. He was able to somehow cope with the situation at the office but at home his situation was unbearable. He had become solitary. Solitude was destroying him from within. Today he cleared all the claims of the lady and after that he had lunch. At about 02 P.M he came to the roof where he was seated now.It was solitude on the top. Sometimes planes were hurling past piercing sky with the roaring sound of its engines. He was sitting calmly there but his innermost part was filled with a volcano of unbearable emotions and contempt over this selfish world. He was unable to understand why a man can not be true to himself and true to society. Why a man does not help others in need and foremost of all why honesty doesnt pay in this wretched society. He was perhaps too mild to be in this harsh and cut-throat society.Some more time passed, and the sky was filled with clouds now. Slowly and slowly, it was becoming dark all around but at a distance, sun rays were still able to pierce the heavy cloud covering and were able to touch the ground. Soon it was raining cats and dogs. He was completely wet now. But his head became somewhat lite after getting covered with water. His apparel was dripping still he was sitting in the same position. After some time, the heavy powering of rainwater converted into drizzling and a rainbow appeared at distance. He slowly turned his gaze toward the rainbow and stood from his seated position. He walked slowly beside the boundary of the roof and started staring at the rainbow.The rainbow was calming his nerves and providing him with some divine kind of bliss. He felt as if he was being filled with some sort of positive vibes. He kept on staring at the rainbow for some time.Some more minutes passed but he was still looking at the rainbow. He felt that the end of the rainbow slowly got lifted from the ground and started moving toward him. The tiny, tiny drops of rain were giving him the feel of some sort of heavenly bliss. The end of the rainbow soon collided with him dispelling all the raindrops around him. The bright colours of the rainbow forced him to close his eyes momentarily.Within a few seconds, everything was calm. There was no rain, neither the rainbow. He was perceiving twinkling lights with his closed eyes. When he opened his eyes, he was astonished to see himself amongst the stars. He was standing in the sky. He was able to see stars twinkling all around him billions of light-years away as if he was floating in the sky. A man in his thirties having brown skin colour and wearing a completely white coat and pants appeared in front of him.Hello, so how was your journey from earth to here, did you felt any uneasiness or any problem, sir, he asked politely.No, but where am I and who are you? asked Frank.I am God, and you have been chosen by the rain of purity as a new resident of heaven, congratulation, said he.What, frank blabbered, what are you saying I did not get it,Well let me take you to the hall of judgement first, he snapped his fingers, and both were inside a big hall with white walls all around and a huge display on one of the walls. He and frank came near the display. It was displaying the life data of Frank; it was displaying 100 percent against the honesty bar of him.See the honesty bar, he pointed toward the green bar over the display. There were many bars in display displaying various other human characteristics. Honesty was one amongst them.Your honesty bar is 100 percent. Whenever a human being has his honesty bar full, the cloud of blessings appears over him brings rains of purity and a rainbow gate to heaven is opened. He is taken to the voidness of the sky from when I bring him to heaven. But before heaven, we came here and tell him why he was chosen. Now tell me do you have any other questions or shall we proceed to heaven,So, said Frank, If I dont want to go to heaven then can I be returned to earth?What are you saying? Why do you want to return there no one respect your honesty. Said he.It may be true that most people dont respect my honesty but, said frank.But what, asked he.It may be true that I sometimes become frustrated with the condition on earth, with the thinking of other people still when I help someone, I feel immense pleasure from within, I just dont want to lose that pleasure. Helping others bring the pleasure in me that perhaps might not come from residing in heaven, said frank.Listening to this He smiled and said,Although, we generally dont send back a human to earth instead I have a job for you,***Frank was walking on the footpath of a road. It was the time of evening. He saw a homeless man sitting beside the footpath. He intentionally dropped his purse containing one million bucks and went past him. He had hardly taken few steps the homeless person came running to him,Sir, you dropped your wallet, the homeless man stopped frank by tapping on his soldier gently. Frank turned to him,Take it, it's your now,No sir, it is yours, I cannot take it, said the homeless man.Frank smiled and took his wallet back from the homeless man. The homeless man returned to his position beside the footpath. While going away from the homeless man frank snapped his fingers and it started drizzling. The rainbow appeared in the sky and one of its ends emerged from the ground and started approaching the homeless man.The End"
The East Star,"Every night he would look out at the sky, in search of the East star. It gave him comfort knowing that there could be a possibility that she would be watching the same star, at the same time. They hadnt talked in years. In fact, they hadnt talked since he had dropped her off that night, but he could still remember how that night felt as clearly as if he were rewatching the memory on CD over and over again. Why they hadnt spoken in years was his fault, he knew that, and although he didnt regret it, he could still feel her weight in his arms. He looked up at the East star again, and watched it twinkle, did she see that too? He shook this thought out of his head and scanned the sky again. She had called him every day for a week after that night on the docks. He never answered, he just watched her number run across the screen, waiting until the green answer button disappeared so he could go back to whatever he was doing before. He could never work up the guts to decline it, the vibration in his hand made her feel closer like she was right next to him again. He used to listen to the voicemails, clinging onto her words, letting the weight of them press into his head before swallowing them into his gut and deleting them so he couldnt be tempted to replay them over and over like a used album.The East star flashed again, catching his eye and he had to force all of his concentration into not noticing it.  he hummed along trying to concentrate on his work, catching the last note in his throat, he blinked away her face and shut the book. It was no use.I like to lay in the sun and feel the warmth on my arms and chest. I like the way the sun feels, like bathing in certainty and consistency. She didnt look at him when she had said this. She laid with her back on the cool metal of the boat docks, continuing to watch the stars above. He had always told her that she thought too much and didnt say enough. Sometimes he could tell she was chewing on her words, trying to fit them together like a jigsaw before she would spit them out perfectly fitted together. This was one of those times.But now I like the feel of the breeze, how it pushes and pulls you without breaking. How it swirls around you, never quite letting you go. She smiled as she said this, playing with his fingers in her hands Thats what youre like. Reciting these words in his head now made his heart beat a different way, almost as if it suddenly wanted to match hers from that night.I dont understand He laughed explain. She turned and he met her eyes.I mean that I feel like Ive known you forever. I feel like my soul knows yours more than my mind does. She waited for his answer but his head felt hollow. After the long pause, he finally said the only thing he could think of.Youre my best friend. The air froze and this is where his memory stopped. He could never fit the pieces together after this. This still memory, which once filled his chest, now left him feeling cool and heavy, unexplainable.. The song played again in the back of his mind and he had to turn on the fan to drown it out. That song was always playing, when there was nothing but silence it was sometimes all he could hear. She had played it for him, waiting for his expression, on the car ride home. At the time he just shrugged his shoulders, nodding, but since then he had played this song over again, trying not to forget the way she made him feel.He was always guessing how she felt. He could almost envision her furrowed eyebrows, chewing on her lip as she waited for his call back. He never called back. He wanted to, but there was nothing he wanted to say, nothing that wouldnt taint that night and confuse his memory of her. He could call, and listen to the silence between them, but it was too late. He tried to imagine the way her eyes would light up if he did call back all these years later. If she would count the rings before finally answering the last one. No-- he had switched numbers.  He turned on his computer, drumming his fingers on the keyboard, not typing anything. The last time she called he didnt listen to the voicemail. He couldnt even remember the way her voice sounded anymore. If it was high and sweet, or low and sincere. It sat on his phone until he finally had to change his number. 18 seconds long. 18 seconds lost in the abyss of the night sky, 18 unknown seconds.A shooting star flew past the East star. Shooting? Falling? They didnt know the difference.Its supposed to be on the end of the little dipper. He had objected, pointing at really nothing in the sky. Cant you see it? She squinted, moving her head to follow his finger. They laid out near the water, in search of the North star.No. I cant. But look-- there. She shifted his arm to the right. That star seems to be the brightest, no? He closed one eye, trying to focus on the canvas above. Shouldnt the north star be the brightest one in the sky? He laughed again. He was always laughing when he was around her, not at her, but because her presence made him feel so light.It should be, but it doesnt look like it is. I think youre right, that one is the brightest. Well name that one the East star.The East star. She mulled it over in her head. Its like our own compass back to each other.At first, he had to squint to see which one she was talking about, but now he could pick it out in seconds. Less than 18 seconds. He knew why he wouldnt call her back. This was something she had asked in one of her voicemails. What are you so afraid of? His need for her walked the thin line between temptation and desperation, something he didn't think she deserved. Something only time could heal.At first, being away from her made him feel like he couldnt fill his lungs up all the way. Like he couldnt catch a breath, but this lessened over time, just like his memories of her did. Even though he stopped being able to fill in the gaps, he never stopped flinching when he heard her name. Her name. He found himself typing it into the search bar of his email, scanning over all of the drafts he never had the guts to actually send. He rubbed his fingers together, finally forcing them all into the trash, knowing he would probably recover all of them in the morning. Sometimes he would reuse them, reuse that night. He caught himself trying to relive the moments they had together with other girls, but it never felt the same, it never felt as easy. Even his girlfriend now never understood his fascination with the night sky, how could he explain it to her? He went to close his laptop when he noticed an extra email buried in the search. Sent 2 years ago, unopened. Im sorry for reaching out like this, but I hope that well follow the East star back to each other eventually. Maybe in the next life. -L He shut his computer looking out the window at the starry canvas one last time before letting her song fill his head."
The Gardener's Wife,"Once there was a gardener who made a vow to his wife that he would rip up all the wild honeysuckle to make picturesque paths under the grand maples, apples, oaks, and pines. He vowed to clear the garden beds of dandelions, thorny thistle, and rag weed, and replace them with roses, lilies, and irises in every color and variety. The gardeners wife joined him at the beginning since she enjoyed beautiful things and being outside with her husband in the fresh air. 	The garden was coming along well and the couple enjoyed their work. They both sat and drank coffee on their mornings of leisure and discussed their plans for the garden. Sometimes they agreed and sometimes their plans diverged, but they were always proud of their work when they looked back on the gardens as the sun set for the evening. 	The gardeners wife surprised the gardener one evening with three abandoned kittens. The gardener admired his wifes good nature and made room for the kittens to live in the garden shed.	The kittens adorned the couples gardens like living statues. Now when the gardener and his wife drank their coffee in the morning they enjoyed the company of the kittens who would sometimes play so wildly they would tumble into a garden bed sending leaves and blossoms flying. The couple would shout and shoo the kittens out of the gardens, but neither one of them could be truly upset. They were only kittens after all. 	Sometimes after the couple had finished their coffee the gardener would begin weeding and transplanting. He expected to see his wife in the garden bed next to him pulling up weeds but she was often where he had left her, still lying in the grass, playing with the cats. The gardener was happy to see his wife so contented and her happiness gave him extra energy as he worked in the sunshine. 	The gardeners wife would still join him from time to time to lend a hand or give advice about the shape of one of the gardens or the plants she felt would make the most harmonious pairings. The gardener could sometimes see the wisdom in his wifes advice, but more often than not he was disposed to design and cultivate the gardens according to his own plans. After a hard day of tending to his plants the gardener liked to step back to appreciate his work. However, as he became more serious about his gardens, the gardener would often toil past sunset into the darkness so that he could barely see the objects of his admiration. 	One late night the gardener found his wife fast asleep. The gardener looked on his wifes sweet face as she slept and he was happy since he knew she would be proud of his work and tell him how much she loved what he had done when they looked out over the land in the morning. Morning came and the gardeners wife asked the gardener if he might like to accompany her on a walk with the cats as they sipped their coffee. She had already walked straight past the main garden as she looked back at the gardener, awaiting his response. You go on ahead, said the gardener, and she and her three cats followed her down the lane as the gardener looked out at his land. He was upset that his wife hadnt paid his new and improved gardens any attention. The gardener looked on the trees and the flowers now and saw work that needed to be done and potential gardens on the horizon that might accommodate his ever growing stock of plants. First though, thought the gardener, I must organize the tools in the garden shed so that my work can be done more efficiently. When the gardener entered the shed he saw that his wife had made an enormous bed for the cats and had relegated his tools to hard to reach corners. 	The gardener had hitherto been tolerant of his wifes new interests and had not pressed her about her withdrawal from the pastime that had previously brought them both so much joy. As the gardener began to sort through the tools his wife had so carelessly tossed aside, he began to dispose of the cats things. The gardener made a fire near the shed and one by one he threw the cats things: toys, bedding, food and water dishes all smoldered in the coals.With each thing the gardener threw away he was reminded of a time the cats had chewed or dug up one of his flowers. When the gardener was all done organizing the shed he dragged a fifty pound bag of wildflower seed in front of the cat door. In his haste to organize the shed perfectly, the gardener inadvertently spilled a five gallon tank of gasoline. The gardener was so intent upon his task that he didnt notice the gasoline fumes wafting through the air. Soon though his delirium overcame the gardener as he lay down upon the freshly swept floor of his perfectly organized shed. 	As the gardeners wife returned from her walk she smelled the gasoline and opened the shed door. She tried to drag the gardener from the shed but he was far too heavy. Just then an ember, maybe a piece of burnt cotton from the cats bedding, floated ever so slowly, making a circuitous course from the fire to the floor of the shed where it met with an ample pool of gasoline. The gardeners wife hurled herself from the doorway of the shed as flames engulfed her husband. He woke just in time to remember some of the joys of his life. He recalled his walks with his wife in the wild woods where they collected moss rocks and listened to the stream rush over the yellow marsh grasses. He thought of the lazy mornings when they would lie in bed and the gardener would regale his wife with absurd stories and bad jokes. He thought of a time before he was a gardener and before she was his wife and of the night he was so bold to ask for a kiss from the prettiest girl he had ever seen. Then the gardener was no more. In all of his last reveries the gardener never once recalled a single flower. 	In her husbands absence the gardeners wife continued to maintain the gardens in her own way. She replaced most of the flowers with ornamental trees. Each day she would choose a different tree to sit under with her cats. This way the weeds never grew up. She used the boards that remained from the burnt shed to build a raised bed where she planted a handful of her husbands favorite flowers. Each night the gardeners wife happily and leisurely watered and weeded the raised bed before she said goodnight to her husband and to the glowing hills as the sun set. The gardeners wife never rebuilt the shed, but she found plenty of space in her house for her three cats plus a dozen or so more which she named after the lilies and irises she had to sacrifice to the wilderness as the weeds slowly overtook them. 	One day many years later while out for a walk in the fields with her cats the gardeners wife pushed back some tall grasses to reveal a clearing. With her eyes full of tears the gardeners wife stooped down to admire a perfect garden in the wild. All of the flowers she thought she had lost; the same flowers for which her cats were named, were all there in full bloom. There were irises which were supposed to bloom in the spring, and lilies which were supposed to bloom in summer, all blooming together at once. The gardeners wife was so happy that she lay down in the dirt and let the sunlight and sweet smell of flowers consume her. With her eyes half opened she saw her cats batting around a perfectly formed iris bud. The gardeners wife smiled, felt the warmth of the sun, closed her eyes, and slept for hours with her cats in the comfort of the wild garden. She only woke late in the evening when it began to rain, and even then she lay for a while, leaving her eyes wide open and trying not to blink as the heavy drops fell."
The Sticky Fingers Affair,"Freezing drizzle soaked Brenda as she ran from her car to the bakery and fumbled with her keys in the pre-dawn blackness. Once inside she hit the switches and light bounced off the gleaming stainless steel benches and equipment. Another switch and the fan ovens whirred into life, soon drowned out by Brenda singing with Black Sabbath on the radio. Coat off, apron on, unwilling wet hair pushed up under her cap and she was ready to bake.Brenda loved this time of day when she could indulge her passion for baking uninterrupted. But this morning was different. Brenda had had a dream so vivid she felt shed lived it. She had dreamt of a new slice, flavoured with coffee and at once chewy, crunchy, sweet, and tart. She felt excited and compelled to make it. As the ovens warmed the bakery Brenda glanced with venom at the decades old product manual of the Sticky Fingers Bakery chain. She had memorised it years ago. It bored and frustrated her, it stifled her creativity and professional development.She was just a small link in this chain, without power or voice. Owner Harry Bommel was a stickler for consistency in his range of products and would never agree to a new slice. She had tried before.When Harry arrived for his inspection at ten oclock the bakery was warm with the aroma of cinnamon, baked fruit, and chocolate. Brendas heart always skipped a beat when he arrived. She took a deep breath in anticipation of the conversation she wanted to have with him as she took the blueberry friands from the oven.Good morning Brenda, everything okay today? He nodded at her.Brenda glanced at him. He was tall, solid, and quite handsome behind his glasses. Not much older than her, in his early fifties. Rumour had it Harry was a bit of a loner and had never married. He was a businessman, focussed solely on making money. He had inherited the business from his father and had not made a change in twenty years.Yes, everythings fine Harry. Can I have a word?Sure, but I dont have much time.Brenda put the friands on the bench and removed her oven mitt. Ive had an idea for a new slice she began.Harry sighed. Ive told you before, were not adding new products. He walked to the door.Dont just walk off. Her temper rose at the arrogance of the man, her frustrations boiled over. You havent even heard my idea. Its coffee flavoured andAre you deaf? Harry stopped, hand on the door handle.No. Im not deaf. Are you ignorant?Harry turned, his face blank, unreadable. Where did this idea come from?Well, it came from me. I dreamt it, and in my dream it became a huge success for your business.He stared at her as if shed just arrived from Mars. Then he roared with laughter. No new products, he said and walked out still chuckling.Brenda felt gutted. Humiliated. Furious beyond words. Tears burned behind her eyes. She was surprised at how much his laughter hurt. She made herself a coffee and took it to the wobbly plastic chair by the back door, amongst the rubbish bins. She seriously needed to look at her choices. She was a skilled, creative, qualified baker. But with daughter Mandy to feed and a mortgage to pay walking out was not an option. Neither was not making the slice. Her head was full of it. The fudgy texture, the rich coffee taste. As she sipped her coffee other options came to mind:She could burn down the bakery. That would fix the prat.She could kill Harry with a rolling pin next time he came in.Or she could make the slice anyway and tempt him to try it.The following morning found Brenda stirring thick creamy custard for the vanilla slice. Apple tarts in the oven sent heavenly wafts of spicy apple around the bakery, and the cooling brownies added chocolaty undernotes. Def Leppard strutted their stuff on the radio, but this morning Brenda didnt sing along.Brenda had the dream again last night. No ordinary dream, this was cappuccino slice on steroids. The ingredients had come to life; currants rattled and shook in their bin, walnuts leapt and thumped against their lid, and the espresso machine puffed and whistled and squirted steam. There was a magical new ingredient wriggling across the bench. Amongst it all Harry had arrived, his handsome face twisted in disapproval. From its position on the bench the rolling pin suddenly dislodged itself, whizzed around the bakery and with a ghastly crunch whacked him on the back of his head. Brenda woke with a scream on her lips.Yikes, concentrate girl, she told herself as the custard started clotting, Harry will do his prunes if the custard isnt smooth. But Harry didnt arrive that morning. Brenda waited all day, becoming more tense as time went on. She meant to speak to him again, to convince him that this slice would be good for his business, to let her try. Two oclock came round, time to go home. Still no Harry. Sick with nerves she checked the chiller and store-room to ensure shed have all necessary ingredients and went home. She was going to make her slice. She was a baker possessed.That evening was filled with the promise of frost when Brenda arrived back at the bakery. The days lingering warmth welcomed her as she shed her jacket and popped her apron on. There was no chance anyone would come in at this time, the place was hers. She switched the radio to the Concert Programme and the soothing sounds of a piano playing Bach flowed around her. This was no time for heavy metal. She closed her eyes and thought back to her dream, picturing how she had made the slice.She melted condensed milk, butter and brown sugar and added two double shots of strong espresso. Then her dry ingredients: biscuit crumbs, coconut, currants, and walnuts. She found herself humming, effortlessly mixing it together, and adding the magic ingredient. She poured it into a tray and popped it in the chiller to set. She made icing by adding another double shot of coffee to icing sugar and butter, spread it over the slice and let it set some more. While she cleaned the equipment she noted she had never felt so exhilarated, so at peace with herself, so fulfilled.It was while she was cutting the slice into forty-eight equal squares that she heard keys unlocking the backdoor. Her heart lunged in her chest. Her head spun. She took a large gulp of air and turned to face Harry.What in on earth are you doing here woman? He stood tall, his face thunderous. An image of the Viking God Thor came to her mind. Tall, broad, muscled, and violent. Missing (thankfully) was the hammer.I might ask you the same thing, you scared the living daylights out of me.I was driving past and saw the lights on.And I came in to make my new slice, which I know will be your best-selling product ever. No need to thank me Harry, it was made with love. If only his personality matched his looks. Whatever made him such an ogre?Youre unbelievable. Ive told you repeatedly were not adding new products. And here you are, stealing my ingredients and electricity, blatantly disobeying me.Brenda glanced at the rolling pin. It didnt move. She sighed with relief. Although he deserved to die, the prat.Well? Harry tapped his fingers on the bench and glanced at the slice.She smiled. Im calling it Cappuccino Slice.What were you going to do with it? You knew I would never sell it here.You have seven Sticky Fingers bakeries Harry, all of them produce the same products every day. Have you asked yourself why this one sells more than the others? Why do the same products here look and taste better? And dont you think the customers are getting bored with the same products year after year?Our formula works well. We cant take risks.Ah, so thats it. Youre scared Harry. Formulas are for science labs. Bakeries need passion, love and creativity.Harry was furious. You have deliberately disobeyed me. Youre suspended and will meet me in my office at nine tomorrow for a disciplinary interview. Please take your things and leave.Brenda grabbed her jacket, snatched a square of the slice, and left, glancing wistfully at the rolling pin as she went.Next morning Brenda found it unsettling to see a relieving baker in her place. A pimply young man who had the Sticky Fingers recipe book spread out over the bench. She felt swamped with fear and doubt, was she that easily replaced?Hi, Im Jeff, he said over his shoulder as he readied a tray of date scones for the oven.Im Brenda. She watched him put the scones into the oven without their sugar and spice topping and decided not to tell him. There was no trace of the Cappuccino Slice. She assumed it was in the compost bin.The tiny cubby hole Harry called his office had a small desk, two chairs and less room than the broom cupboard. She switched on the desk-lamp which lit up the desk but cast a gloomy half-light through the rest of the windowless space. The tick-tick-ticking of the wall clock unnerved her. Fifteen minutes to wait.She sat down, stretched her legs, and yawned. She hadnt slept. The slice had needed eating when she got home, and it had been everything she had dreamt. Her teeth had sunk through the creamy icing into the fudgy base. Her mouth had filled with the earthy crunch of walnuts, and the tanginess of chewy currants which balanced the soft sweetness perfectly. The satisfying coffee flavour had exploded on her tastebuds. It was divine. A Goddess food.As the night crept on she had become increasingly concerned about her future. Harry was bound to sack her and unlikely to give her a reference. Her mortgage was huge, and Mandys university fees had gobbled up her reserves. During the dark hours Brenda had searched her soul. What could she have done differently? Not making the slice had not been an option, she knew that in her bones. Perhaps she had been too rude when she spoke to Harry. His arrogance, lack of acknowledgement and his laughter at her dream had hurt, and because it hurt her responses to him were sassy and unprofessional. But why had it hurt? Could it be that she cared for him, and was more than a little attracted to him? Hot tears soaked her pillow. When she faced him she would need to put those feelings aside. She would need to be professional and apologise. And with that resolve she awaited her fate.She stood up when Harry arrived. The faint light softened his features, he looked almost human. He nodded at her to sit. Swallowing hard she raised her eyes to meet his. She couldnt read them, but something in them had changed.Harry, Im sorry for the way I spoke to you, it was disrespectful, she began.Yes it was.Its just that I love baking so much, and I have so many ideas that could make this place amazing. But Im willing to tow the line if you give me another chance. She felt his eyes on her. Her face flushed hot.Then he smiled, and his eyes twinkled behind his glasses. In that instant Brenda knew he had tried the slice. Hed tasted the love.He stood up. Come with me, he said and led her through the bakery to the shop. In the middle of the counter, stunningly arranged on a glass platter, stood the cappuccino slice.I have decided to employ a professional baker to review the product list and ensure quality and consistency across the chain. Would you be interested Brenda?Brendas mouth dropped open but she was dumbstruck.You were right Brenda, he continued, change scares me, and we need to move forward. Why dont we discuss it over dinner this evening. Ill pick you up at seven. Harry smiled and looked into her eyes. Brenda blushed some more.Okay, she said.The Cappuccino slice wiggled on the platter. Mission accomplished.(Note: This story was written in New Zealand, I'm aware that in some parts of the world a slice is not known as a bakery item. In NZ and Australia it is a flat oblong biscuit based cake, sometimes with filling ore icing. It comes in many different flavours.)"
Miss May,"I jerked my right elbow to remove his hand from my left breast.  Nope. Not tonight, I told him, pulling my book closer to my nose. A shield to prevent further attacks.  Adam rolled over onto his back with a huff, then gave me that wounded puppy look that, much like an evening on red wine, makes me want to laugh, then cry. Five years married and he wasnt showing any signs of slowing down. I suppose I should count myself lucky. But then he hadnt had to go through what I went through today. Unless they had started a bring your kid to work day in the kitchen where he worked as chef.  How comes, Lou? And dont say a headache because I already served your spaghetti with a pinch of paracetamol in your parmesan.  I involuntary cackled before telling him it wasnt right to joke about that sort of thing. Im always having to watch what I say at the school and it can take me a while to shake off that cloak. Sometimes until the following morning, when Ill start calling the shower a twat for taking ages toproduce any hot water. When that happens, Ill use the noise of the cascading shower to bleat any more expletives wanting to hop off my tongue. By the time Ive dried off, theyve all been swept down the plughole.  Adam continued. Are you sure its something a nice massage couldnt help with?  I brushed his hand away, again. Oh my god, do you ever give up? I love it when you call me God, he grinned.  I rolled my eyes up, catching sight of a cobweb in the bedroom ceiling. I knew our cleaner had been cutting corners.  I just had a really weird day at school. Not really in the mood. Sorry. Would telling me help? Im probably not supposed to. His eyebrows rose up closer to his already receding hairline. It ran in his family. Hed probably just shave it all off in a year or two and then he and his brothers will pass as triplets.  I wasnt all that interested in my book anyway, so sod it. Itd probably get out soon anyway, knowing what our community is like for gossip.  Ugh, fine. Get comfortable. Oh boy, a bedtime story! He fluffed his pillow as though crashing cymbals while I fumbled around for my bookmark. So, this kid at schoolwell call her Ariana- How Grande. No interruptions, please. Yes, maam. One of the other kids came over to my desk at lunch while I was marking the history homework I was supposed to have done the other night but youd brought home those leftovers that gave me the shits (thanks again, by the way). Well call her Doja. How catty. I pinched my husbands lips together. Let me tell you this before I overthink it and change my mind. The reply was muffled, indicated concession. Doja came to tell me that Ariana was out in the Wendy house acting kinda funny. I still had about a dozen pieces to mark but I thought what if the kids having a fit or something? Doja tends to downplay things. Like when she said Harry, who well call Harry, had bumped his arm falling off the climbing frame when hed gone and broken his elbow. So she takes me by the hand and starts marching me off.  Well, turns out Ariana had gone and raided the arts and crafts supply cupboard, because clearly we dont have the funding to give them the lunch hour excitement they obviously crave. Shed  oh god, this is so wrong  shed gone and made herself ears out of plastic cups shed tied to her hairband with bits of string and had pinned a white pom-pom to the back of her skirt. She was calling the Wendy house her mansion. What. The. Fu- I told you it was weird. Ariana was telling all her pals  shes got quite the cult following this one, for always being a show off and drama queen  to call her Miss May. At first I thought she meant like missed me and that was the name of the latest game shed invented, but nope. Oh and by the way, her shirt was lying in one corner of this mansion and she was pressing her little chest (luckily she had a vest on) on the windows of this playhouse. One of the boys was asking me if I knew if there was bad weather coming because apparently Ariana had kept telling the others to make it rain. I jumped as someone appeared to have pulled the pin out of Adam, who was about to give himself a hernia laughing.  Oh Lou, he said between hiccups, this is too good. No, it isnt. Its very bad. I know  for you, maybe  but for meI I waited patiently for the next convulsion of laughter to leave his system. He rubbed his eyes. Continue, he said, in a voice trying very hard to acknowledge the gravity of the situation.  I had to bend down and knock on the door of the house feeling like a cop come to bust up a house party and asked Ariana what was going on. You are going to love this. So, apparently Arianas mother was a Miss April. Actually, now I think about it, I think shes mentioned it before but I thought it was just a weird way of letting her know her mum isnt married and theyre on first name terms. I shrugged, while Adam started to vibrate from barely held in chuckling again. She said, Mummy told me she was a very famous house bunny and one of the favourites and that men used to pay a lot to go to a house to see her with no top on and then starts going on about some make up palette shes trying to save up forChrist, kids these days, when I was her age the only palette we used was the one wed pour oil paint on. At least shes demonstrating a good work ethic. Okay, dont give me that look. The look that would turn a lesser man to stone. So I found myself having to explain to Ariana that she should try to raise funds byoh, I dont know, literally any other way possible and that what her mother had done was a grown up job only grown-ups could do and, argh, it was so awkward and from now on Im locking my door when marking bloody homework. Let some other schmuck figure out how to deal with that shit. I feel honoured you shared that with me, Lou. And by the way, when is the next parent-teacher evening and can I tag along? I elbowed him. Then told him only if he promised not to rabbit on."
"Souls, Spirits, Whatever You Call It","The first time I saw her I was freshly 16; my birthday is in September, so it was the first week of school and I was completely drained. I was having some banal dream about being a volunteer at a shelter, but the shelter was full of unicorns or whatever. I dont remember what task I was doing in this random fantasy, but I remember I saw her on the other side of the yard. She was wearing a blue shirt and her hair was in a ponytail. She looked distressed and out of place. And she was in color. Its hard to verbalize, but I almost always dream in muted shades. Not in black and white or even gray, but just in a duller world, like a painting thats been left in the sun. She was practically neon, so vibrant she looked saturated. It was disorienting, to say the least, and I woke up in a cold sweat. I felt unsettled yet strangely comforted. Something inside me recognized her, something I wasnt yet in tune with. This part of me, however hidden and however irrelevant, cracked open and screamed at me viciously. It screamed in a way that I could not hear myself think, I could not try to read, and I could absolutely could not go back to sleep. After that night I didnt sleep for more than 4 hours at a time. I was terrified to see her again so I avoided dreaming altogether, but I couldnt maintain this state of living for more than a week. Eventually I passed out on the couch from sheer exhaustion and fell into a 12-hour sleep paralysis. It was then that she reappeared.                                 --------------------------------- Hello?Even her voice is colorful. Im in a white void, but everytime she speaks rainbows oscillate above in patterns like the Northern lights.Yeah, hello?Im scared absolutely shitless, but Im also paralyzed so I decide to act confident. Its not like I can fight back anyways.They said I should look for you?The rainbow glimmers with more intensity.What? Who are you?Im Steph? From The Department?Department? Department of what?Yes, The Department of What. Exactly.The rainbow seems to sigh with satisfaction.No, what?Yes, what. Also when, why, and how. Not who though. Thats the OtherSide.Are you the lady from the shelter? With the blue shirt?Yes! Yes, thats me! Oh, Im so glad you remember. Sometimes people forget.And your name is Steph?Well...sure. Im sorry, I just realized I never solidified. How rude.And just like that, in both an instant and an eternity, the rainbow caves into itself and forms a human female. She looks exactly like the shelter woman, but minus the ponytail and shes wearing a floral dress. An ugly floral dress. God, its hideous.Okay. Hi, Steph. I reach out my hand for her to shake.Hi, Andy. Its a pleasure. She has a lovely smile and a firm handshake, but I cant stop looking at the dress. It looks like my grandmas curtain.Can you explain please?I was no longer panicking, for some reason. It was like touching her hand has infused me with heroin; Im totally at peace.Oh, of course, dear. So like I said, Im from The Department of What, When, Why, and How. Im our customer service rep. She smiles.Oh.I understand youre confused. However, all of your questions will be answered shortly. Just follow me, please.She starts to walk along the whiteness and I realize we are in a box. Shes walking towards a small door at the edge, but its not really a door, actually. Its just a translucent curtain.Right through here, please. She smiles again and touches my shoulder, and the heroin feeling comes back.Suddenly Im in a conference room at a...a Hilton hotel, yes. It has grey chairs and a rectangular desk and harshly dim lighting that gives me a headache. You guys normally seem comfortable here. Steph has changed into a sleek power suit with a slicked-back bun. She matches the vibe perfectly, and it does make me feel strangely at peace. I guess we humans do crave comfort.Please, have a seat. We havent got much time.I pull up a chair and realize Im wearing a suit too, but mine is much less crisp. I glance at the surrounding glass and see that I look exhausted.Why do I look so crappy?I dont know, dear, its based on your aura. I think you need to relax. Anyways, lets begin.A whiteboard appears in front of her, along with a girl my age in pink pajamas. The girl is upright, sleeping, and quite beautiful. I think she looks like that girl from Bring It On, the leader of the Clovers.Okay. This is Bella. The name Bella appears on the whiteboard behind Steph in pink cursive, and I somehow know that its in Bellas handwriting.Bella is your soulmate, so to speak. I hate how you humans have gentrified that word. It has an actual meaning beyond physical life.Shes my soulmate? I glance back at the stunning girl in the pink pajamas and cant refrain from smiling.Yes. She is, and Ill let you get acquainted in a little bit.Steph shifts uncomfortably, which makes all the chairs change colors. Shes talking too fast, and I get a bad feeling.What?Well, Im here because...well, this is just so difficult to explain. There are some people with souls, essences, spirits, whatever you want to call it that just mesh. Like theyre meant to be together. ButBut what?My heart sinks. Bella twitches.Well, you just cant be together in the physical realm.Why not?Your corporal forms and cognitive minds and all that junk dont mesh well. Based on our calculations, youd probably marry, be miserable, and have a brutal divorce that would haunt your two kids forever. Theres also a statistically significant chance youd murder each other. A bunch of numbers and images appear on the board behind her, but I dont really notice.Its extremely rare this happens, Andy. Less than one in a billion. But when it does, The Department tries to give you an opportunity to be together in some way. So heres our offer: you two can dream together, 8 hours a day but no more, and do whatever you want. Other than that, you may not attempt to contact each other, speak to each other, or anything of the sort.I think about what the consequences would be if I did.They will be grave. Obviously she can fucking read minds. I pause and try to make my mind go blank.I agree.Steph freezes.Does she?Steph blinks.Does Bella?Bella agreed a couple weeks ago. Weve been waiting for you. I tried to contact you before, but your dreams move very rapidly. It makes it hard to travel.Can I meet her?Andy, I have to warn you that once you meet her, you will fall madly in love with her. She will consume your every moment for the eight hours a day that you sleep, but after that, you will have no memory of her. Shell fade into your mind just like every other dream. Are you sure thats what you want?And I cant explain it, but in that moment I know that it is exactly what I want. 8 hours a day is a third of my life, and looking at Bella I know she is worth it.Yes. Its what I want.Okay. Here you go.The room dissipates into air along with Steph, and me and Bella are left standing in the white void. Shes awake now, and I see that her eyes are honey colored.Hi. Her voice is like music.Hi, Bella.Call me Belly.She grabs my hand and walks towards the edge of the void, moving towards something I cant quite see. Yet somehow, just like her, I know its there.                       ---------------------------------------- My wife and I are in a diner celebrating my 52nd birthday. Its close to our house, and with the kids off at college we have plenty of time to go out now. I dont love breakfast for dinner, but its her favorite thing, so Ill go with it. Shes devouring a plate of chocolate chip waffles like its her last meal, but my omelet is kind of gross so I leave it alone.Anyways, Deborah was saying that Sally and Ron are considering divorce. But, you know, theyre old parents. Like, their kid is still only eight, Andy. Imagine what a divorce would do to an eight year old.Yeah, I cant imagine it doing any good.Im not paying much attention, but she doesnt seem to notice.So anyways, theyre fighting all the time, and their kid told the teacher, who call..  Everything trails off. The world goes blank and all I see is a beautiful woman walking by the window. She looks like shes about my age, maybe a bit younger. Shes talking on the phone with someone, and I can tell by her face that its a pleasant conversation. Shes wearing a winter jacket even though its 70 degrees. Her face is kind. She has a mole by her lower lip. I can just tell she knows Im staring at her, but she doesnt seem to mind. Like shes done it a million times, she looks at me. Not past me or through me, but at me. I look back. Her eyes are honey-colored. Something inside me clicks. Baby? I turn towards my wife and watch the world come back, and when I look back at the window shes gone. Honey, where did you go? She has syrup all over her chin.Oh, I just thought I saw someone I knew.Who? Im unsure of how to answer that question, so I take a bite of my omelette and stare at the spot where my perfect woman just was."
Dream and Sleep Clinic,"Luke shot straight up in his bed. He head and neck were drenched with sweat. He tried to adjust his eyes in the darkness of the room.Mia woke up to his heavy breathing. Luke faced her now.""Baby what is it? Another nightmare?""""This was the worst nightmare yet.""Mia moved closer to his side of the bed. She took his hand .Gave it a gentle squeeze then laid her thick head of curls against her husbands arm. His breathing returned to normal.""Baby, its alright. It wasn't real. Do you want to talk about it?""""No, I just want to forget it.""Luke leaned back against his pillows.He reached for her arm. She let him ease her down beside him.Luke kissed the side of her face. She smiled.""Are you sure your ok?"" she asked him.""I'm fine. It was nothing. We have to be up in a few hours.""""I know. But you scared the hell out of me before.""""I didn't mean to. I just want this to end.""***The hallway was long and narrow. Luke felt like he had walked and walked for hours but there appeared to be no end in sight. The quicker he went the longer it seemed to take. There was a glowing red light just up ahead. He was sure he could reach it. The walls were appeared to be closing in. Then just as he felt like his legs couldn't carry him one more step, the floor opened underneath swallowing him. Luke tried to grab hold of the walls but it was too late. He was descending into an endless abyss.He shot straight up and took in the room around him. Again his heart felt like it was beating too fast. Again he sat covered in sweat.  He tried to remember what day it was and why he was on the living room sofa. No matter what time he slept his nightmare returned. Luke ran his over the front of his face. Then he reached down on the hardwood floor for his cell phone.He looked at the time. He had only been asleep for two hours.Why did he continue to have these nightmares? What were they trying to tell him?***Luke showered, dressed and headed for the kitchen. He glanced at the microwave oven. 5:47 pmMia should be home any minute. Luke went to the fridge and opened the door. He looked over the selection of left overs, water bottles and three different yogurt flavors that Mia liked so much.Luke grabbed a giant glass bowl covered with tin foil and took it to the table. After he retrieved a fork, he removed the foil, stuck the fork inside the bowl and began to eat the cold spaghetti from the other nights dinner.When his wife walked in the den, Luke was standing in front of the flat screen TV, she shook her head. He grinned at her.""You could have at least heated it up.""""I like it cold. You want some?"" He lifted the glass bowl in her direction. She made a face.""No thanks. I picked us up a pizza. I had to stay late again and had no idea what to make. You probably don't want anything.""Mia hurried out of the room.Luke found her at the counter, she was separating the slices from the box. He stood there just taking in her beauty. Mia placed two slices on a paper plate. Luke set the bowl on the kitchen table and came up behind her. He placed his hands around her waist then slowly kissed the back of her neck.""Oh no. You already had yours this is all mine.""She laughed as he turned her to face him. He stared at her. His deep brown eyes could always make Mia forget about everything.""You know how much I like pizza.""She grinned. He did too.""Yes I know. You probably like it more than me.""Luke knew this game. Mia raised a warm and cheesy slice off the plate and placed it in front of Luke's mouth. It smelled incredible. His mouth watered. Mia continued to grin.""Go on have some. You know you want to.""He took a big mouthful then stood there and chewed.She watched him enjoying himself.""Good?""""Oh yeah, its better than good. You already know that. Can I join you?""Mia thought it over.""Well you do work hard and I'm sure that spaghetti was disgusting.""Luke shook his head. He made a sad face.""And I find you very attractive. But if I'm going to share, you must do exactly as I say.""Luke waited for Mia to place more pizza on a plate for him as he took two glasses from the cabinet above the sink.***They ate till they were full. Talking about their day and how much they both needed another vacation. They made love than fell asleep in each others arms. Mia heard Luke whimper. She thought it was the TV. She sat up quickly. He appeared to be in distress. She shook him several times before he finally woke.""You have to tell me what your dreaming about.""""No, what good would it do?"" Luke leaped off their bed and left the bedroom. Mia could hear him running the water in the sink. She wanted to help but he wouldn't let her.***For five more nights Luke had nightmare after nightmare. Each time Mia tried to comfort him he only grew more distant. She was beginning to feel like she was losing him. Mia asked a few of her friends if they knew much about dreams or a good doctor that had answers.With a phone number in her hand Mia called the Dream and Sleep Clinic. Her good friend had found her their number after Mia explained how badly Luke was behaving.A sweet sounding lady answered on the third ring.""Good afternoon, this is Kim. How can I help you?""""Hi, I need to make an appointment.""""Ok, have you been here before?"" Kim asked.Mia cleared her throat.""No, the appointment is for my husband not me. But I would like to accompany him if that's ok.""""Sure I don't see why not. Can I have his date of birth please?""""Yes, Its 5, 15, 79... his name is Luke, do you really help people?""""Not me personally, but the doctors do yes. What days were you looking for?""***Luke wasn't pleased with Mia but he agreed to go anyway. They sat together in the canary yellow waiting room. Luke tapped his foot nervously as Mia looked over the forms on the clip board that lay on her lap.""You have to stop that. Its making me nervous. Its not like their going to draw blood. I'm sure they will just ask you a bunch of questions.""""Still it feels strange going to a doctor over my dreams.""""Nightmares Luke. You have been tired, irritable and I just want it to end. Don't you want the same?"" He looked shocked.""Of course I do. I'm not doing this to ruin your life."""" I know that. But you have to get a handle on it now. Before its gets any worse. Please, you said you would try.""***Luke sat on the other side of the deep mahogany desk. Dr. Andrew Reid had a thick head of coppery red hair, a long thin nose and bright hazel eyes. He pushed his eye glasses up on the bridge of his nose. He looked down at the papers upon his desk which contained what he knew of Luke.""So Luke. Besides your medical history, I will need some back ground on you. Have many cups of coffee do you drink?""Luke wondered what this had to do with anything.""Two or three."""" You should probably switch to decaf. How much television do you watch on any given day?""""Not much. I work full time.""""Ok, bare with me. How many days have you been awake? How many hours of sleep do you consider normal?'***Once the questions were answered, Luke was asked to close his eyes and take several deep cleansing breaths. Dr. Reid crossed the room and came to stand in front of his patient.""With your eyes remaining closed, think back to the first night the dream occurred. You can see yourself after you awaken from the dream. You are in your own room  and Mia is beside you. Nothing to fear. Can you tell me how you feel?""""Warm, I am always warm when I wake.""""No Luke, your feelings about this dream. Scared, anxious, sad, perhaps worried you will dream it again. Chose one word only.""Luke let out a long sigh.""Anxious. It will happen again.""*** Mia and Luke returned home.  She waited for him to get comfortable before she asked him what if anything he had learned about his dreams. Luke explained to her that Dr. Reid expected him to do homework for the next few nights. He wanted Luke to begin and continue with a sleep routine. He explained this would help him get relaxed and ensure peaceful dream free nights.Mia had her doubts. Luke stopped drinking coffee, stayed away from screens in the evening and would go to bed at nine for the next seven days. It did little at first but over time he noticed he was calmer and had more energy during the day. Luke took notes whenever he dreamed and then Googled and researched the meanings behind his dreams. It was months later before Luke slept dream free. That is without his occurring nightmares.*** The truth is we all dream. Each and every night. Some of us find dreams interesting while others find them scary. The very thought of not having power over your own thoughts can worry most of us. For hundreds of years doctors and scientists have studied our dreams. They can write books and make movies about them but they still remain a mystery to this day. Dreams are universal. The one thing we humans have in common. Good or bad.Scary  or interesting.Dream or nightmare.Whatever they truly are we are fascinated by dreams.  So close your eyes and sleep sound tonight."
I Saw You in a Dream,"I felt a momentary haze, a crowd of people surrounded me, and myself amongst them. I never liked places like these. The confusion and exhaustion it elicited leave me feeling thousands of miles away from people who are physically next to me. For myself, there is a perpetual feeling of loneliness in large crowds. Ive never cared for people, not in large crowds at least. I preferred the company of others as we sit across from each other in a quiet restaurant. In a Christian sense, my love for others was present, no matter how begrudging that may be. After years in my faith, the commandment to love was, not a feeling, but a goal that required personal and external work in multiple complex senses. Something that I personally failed at, more often than I would like to admit, even with those who I claimed to love and care for. I took a drink of water and smoothed the wrinkles in my black sweater. I scanned the room for my mother who seemed to be my only source of solace at these parties. I probably looked rude to most people, but my emotional unavailability and irritation with small talk was my problem and not theirs. As I look up, I hear her voice carry a conversation with another. My mothers voice sounds like mine, but brighter and less frigid. The other voice rocks part of my soul with its gruff warmth. Were happy to see you! I hear her say as my father stands next to her and nonchalantly nods. Thanks, its been a long time since Ive been back, the second voice says. I recognize it but Im terrified to put a name to the recognizable sound. My eyes absorb the imagery in front of me. My parents' kind demeanor talking to a boy, no, a man now, who had a scar down the back of his head and a uniform on. My mind jumps at calling him a man, the last time I had seen him he was nothing more than a scared, petulant, little boy. I can still see his eyes looking at me like I was a black cat that crossed his path, and him a person fearing the omen that I represented in that time of my life. I see his gaze shift from my parents to me, as his face looks less fearful and more comforted at the sight of me. That subtle calming smile climbing across his face felt like sunlight on a Sunday afternoon in August. The warmest peace in an eternal three oclock as you lie beneath a window while falling asleep. Every part of me had longed for him to look at me that way. Still, I was fearful of this. There was a fragility in it that if I said or did the wrong thing, this little vision would turn into an embarrassing moment for me. I desired his gaze and still avoided it. As I tried to step out and move away, I bumped into him. Its been awhile... His voice was quieter. There was a mature sentiment to it that had not been there in earlier years. Yeah, it has... I trailed off, feeling passive, and terrified to do anything. For years since I left, I had daydreamed of this. Spare moments between difficult classes and jobs had left me in prayer to God and daydreaming of what I believed I had missed. Though my prayers were not unfounded, my feelings appeared to me as meaningless drivel. I was a young woman, who spent her free time daydreaming and living in a fantasy, like any other girl would have done. Still, I would step out of it, and never fail to remind myself that it was a fantasy, something I made up to cope with monotonous everyday life. I can feel the tensity, we werent on bad terms, but for us, I didnt believe there would be good terms. Just indifference of people we once knew, that we are unsure of what meaning we represented in our lives. He interrupts the stagnant silence, Hows school? I heard you were planning on going into medicine? Its good, yeah. I am. I complain about the medical industry so much, I figured if I whine that much I should do something about it. I stop, flattered he asked but still trying to only take it as a gesture of friendliness. How's the military? Im trying to hold the conversation, Im happy, though it seems more like Im struggling. I have no idea what to do. Good, yknow its hard-but I signed up for it. His tone even as a matured man had a sweet farm boy tone to it. Not pandering, but genuine and local. The way he spoke was polite and accommodating but if he knew the intensity that hid behind my words, I think hed run away as though hed seen the ghost of whatever emotion was between two twenty-year-olds. Im happy its going well for you. The silence in me swallows everything in the vicinity as a thought walks across my mind like an actor on an empty stage, emerging into a singular spotlight. How do you tell someone youve cared for them even if theyre no longer part of your life? How do you tell them they had some impact on you? How do you be vulnerable with a person? All of these words that wanted to spill out of my mouth could be wrongly intentioned and detrimental. I could only stand there, looking into his eyes. With whatever availability was left in me I let out I have so much respect for you. He smiled at this, it was pleasant and warm, I wanted to stay there with him. I could see him mouth thank-you but the sound was gone. [...] I woke up in my bed, an alarm buzzing and my eyes tired. I hate my dreams. They are frequent and detailed. I never forget people because they show up years later as a passing face. Sometimes prophetic and sometimes emotional and fear-based. Part of me wants to go back to that dream, I want to apologize for feeling like I couldnt reciprocate anything, for not knowing what to do, for feeling like I was too late. These were feelings though, hormones bouncing in my body, and nonsensical guilt that wracked me. I would love to see him again, but it would not compare to the thing my mind had cultivated as a comfort to sore wounds. Its all a lie even though I wish it wasnt."
Tommy LaFontaine,"CW: drug dependency, suicideTommy LaFontaine had always dreamt of going to other dimensions. No, he literally always dreamt of going to other worlds, and every time he did, he learned something new.For example, did you know there's a place where books read people? They have libraries instead of homes, and rather than dying they become overdue. The entire world is literal, right off the page... so they find the unpredictability and emotional outbursts of humans, quite entertaining. Their leader's name is Dewey Decimal, and they live a very orderly life.Tommy always hated when his astrally-projected unconscious self nestled back into the sleeping body that it was tethered to. He didn't like his life here,full of emotional abuse and deadlines. He'd much rather be surfing the icy surface of Europa, or dodging rocky ice chunks in Saturn's rings.Yet another world had up for down, and down for up, like some bizarro Dr. Seuss story. In that place, the inhabitants were scared of falling into the sky, rather than down from it. Their version of adrenaline pumping thrill-seekers, didn't go to great heights for bungee jumping or base jumping back to earth, but rather they went as high as they could in a free-dive upward, to cheat death and avoid slipping the surly bounds of space.Back in his real life, nobody would believe Tommy's recalling of his adventures. Even when he tried to tell his closet friends that his dreams indeed took him to other worlds, he was met with criticism and disbelief. No matter though. He got so good at traveling through his dreams, that he started to be able to use his own willpower and experiences to actually create the other dimensions and worlds. He even started designing the portals themselves in his mind's eye. After all, there were an infinite amount of parallel universes in the multiverse.Once he watched his favorite film; Tim Burton's . He concentrated as hard as he could manage on the lines and characters before drifting off to sleep. When his R.E.M. awoke him ""on the other side"", he was shocked to hear greats like Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken say that they really admired his work and acting abilities. ""My favorite was 'Tommy tries to make Mac & Cheese and then feeds it to his dog, because it was so bad'"", said Christopher Lee. ""That performance had so much range, and felt so lifelike and wrought with emotion"", continued the BAFTA honoree, who was merely a Burgomaster in his world.  Christina Ricci, his longtime crush, had even asked for Tommy's autograph. Of course in their world the Headless Horseman was real, so as fun as it was for Tommy, he was glad to return home safely, even if he had extremely enjoyed his fifteen minutes in fanboy heaven.Back in his real life, Tommy would continue to get extremely and perpetually bored. People had utterly no comprehension of the billions upon billions of alternative realities out there. They seemed perfectly content living a meaningless and mundane existence. If they had known, surely they wouldn't be wasting their time arguing over Presidential candidates and other red pill/blue pill stuff. His dream-induced travels quickly became addictive. He soon found himself doing whatever it took to make it to ""the other side"". It started off innocuously enough, when he had drunk a large dose of NyQuil to stave off a cold.On that adventure, he went to a universe where whales ruled their version of earth, that was made of three-quarters land. They spoke to each other in sonar and sonic waves and traveled many miles at a time. Their thoughts were telepathic and Tommy remembered them venturing on land to study him as they wore gigantic mobile salt water encased suits. They concluded Tommy's species was the second most intelligent form of primate, and that his kind, 'humans', probably had good memories. A group of them got excited when Tommy came next to their vessel and tried to speak to them. The close encounter with the human was stimulating for the Cetacea group of tourists.Tommy would find it increasingly difficult to deal with the realities of his humdrum life. The monotony of rules and laws and societal norms weighed heavily on him, the older he got. Soon he found himself completely droning out everything from his literal world, and he constantly longed instead for the sweet release of dreams. Not long after that, he sought out medical professionals to help him induce sleep and to help bridge the gap between his reality and his dreamlike-altered states.The following trip proved to be his greatest. It was hands down the most magnificent trip Tommy LaFontaine had ever been on in any dimension, earthly or otherwise. He found himself in a world where one could experience any historical event imaginable, without suffering any of the actual consequences of actually being present at that particular time. Want to watch the band play on the sinking Titanic? No problem. Care to hear Churchill or Hitler address crowds from the front row? Ask and you shall receive. It was a time-traveling, historically accurate amusement park for adults. Tommy made the most of it. He walked with Neil Armstrong on the moon, watched Cleopatra make love to Caesar, and bore witness to Queen Elizabeths coronation, all in half a days time.Does this work in the future, like going forward?, asked Tommy of a fellow passerby.Sure, pal. Whatever you can possibly imagine., came the answer.Tommy transported himself to his own home, just 20 years later. He was curious as to how he had turned out, but there were no kids or grandkids there to meet him and sit around a Christmas tree. Instead, just like Ebenezer Scrooge in his third act, Tommy LaFontaine learned that the tediousness and boredom of his day-to-day had proved too much for him to bear. He had taken his own life this very next wake up from the present dream he was currently experiencing in the here and now.Tommys jaw dropped and his tongue grew achingly dry. He needed a drink. Next he found himself backstage at Wembley Stadium sipping on Jack & Cokes as Freddie Mercury warmed up with vocal octaves. He shared a very erudite physics joke with Brian May before the Live Aid concert began. He had finally made up his mind that he was not going home. Not ever again.The next day, in our world here on earth, they found the body of Tommy LaFontaine. He was nestled in bed sandwiched between a down comforter and straddling a long pillow. A pleasant smile was permanently plastered across his now cold and pale face.The coroner would eventually rule that Tommy LaFontaine had died in his sleep of a propofol overdose. Another victim of chasing dreams."
Memory & A Man Walking On His Hands,"This is my worst nightmare.Im alone, in the middle of an alleyway, way after the sun has clocked out. Theres one street lamp, but it taunts me. I can just choose not to flicker back on. I can just go out for good, and you wont even be able to see a foot in front of you. Theres patches of grass and dirt hugging the brick walls that are at my sides. Thought: Ahead, or backwards. Your only two options. Make the right choice. I reach up to adjust the glasses on my face, but of course they arent there. Theyre never on my face. My mother would be judging me right now. Whats the point in buying you glasses if youre never gonna use em? Who just likes not being able to see? I always feel weird when she says that, like its borderline problematic.I start walking ahead, to the street in front of me. And even though I know I have nothing, I feel around to take stock of what I have to defend myself. I wish my brain couldve made me have a knife, or at the very least, pepper spray. But, its like Im incapable of making sure Im somewhat safe and ok. I already know hes right around the corner. I consider turning around, but Ive tried this before. Ive tried to find another way home, but there was no use. I have to go forward to get home. My legs threaten to stop working. they urge. I continue walking. Theres a few whispers, but none makes sense to me. They may just be the wind. They have to be. Dont scare yourself anymore than you already are. I feel like I should run. I hate running. But, you run when youre scared. You run when you have no self defense skills, or tools on you. You run when you need to get to get home in the middle of the night. You run when you dont trust the light youre dependent on. There are certain people who can control what they see and hear. There are certain people who can calm themselves, and make sure they dont have a panic attack. Im not either of those types of people.When my brain starts to stir up something, Im at its mercy. I start to run and try to pretend Ill get to my house without bumping into the man. He wont be there. I reach the end of the alleyway and look to my left. Theres the sidewalk. I look to my right, theres darkness. I look ahead, theres a house.No man.Were all just forgetting things. The longer you live, the more you forget. His voice sounds like gravel, and comes out almost like a wheeze. Hes what a smoker sounds like to me. The man materializes about six feet in front of me. He walks on his hands, and from the way his body is positioned, I can tell he came from my right. My vision isnt that good, but its good enough to make out his stomach has sweat dripping down it. Ive never seen him sweat. Maybe thats just my brain coming up with something new. Or maybe, I simply dont remember it. Thought: SpeakThought: Smile. Be pleasant. Tell him to have a nice night, and keep walking. No words come out, but I attempt to smile. I walk straight ahead; my knees knock and wobble. He moves slightly out of the way. I notice the wind moving, and my body feels like when you lower your body into cold water on a hot day. The wind says something. Not a voice. Theres no one else around. We havent seen you in awhile. I look up at the house. Three stories. Originally painted bright daisy yellow, but it has long turned into the yellow from a dried marker. My mother sleeps inside. My room is right above hers. My bladder knocks before I can knock. Theres no key, I lost it a few days ago. Thought: I havent been here in awhile. Ive been staying up late and passing out whenever I can. Nothing comes of my dreams. Theres only darkness. I try the doorknob. It twists all the way, and I almost leap out of my shoes with joy. We love you. The wind and the man say. I want to tell them to leave me alone forever. When I open the door, my eyes open. I know theres no use in me trying to move. My legs feel like bricks, and my chest feels like someone is lying on top of me. Not the good kind though, like when my little brother was a baby and insisted on sleeping on my chest almost every night. Hed never admit to that now though. Once when I confided in my friend Corrie, and told her all about my horrifying night, she cocked her head back and laughed so hard milk shot out her mouth and nose. As she cleaned herself up and tried to calm down she said, You experienced BDSM with a ghost. I didnt know you were such a freak. Then she winked at me and all throughout the day she pretended to sling a whip at me.I laughed and pulled my sleeves to cover my trembling hands. Tonight, I can somewhat hear Russian. Its one of those nights. The extra weird ones.A lady says something that I can understand. I promise I can, but in the morning her words will not be Google-able. Ive considered taking a course of Duolingo, but figured Ill never be able to remember her words anyway, so theres no use in torturing myself. Thought: What if she wants to sacrifice you?My heart quickens.Thought: heart attack?Thought: cant beThought: Move, try to move. How does your arm feel? If it hurts, youre having a heart attack. My mouth opens. Mom!Mom!Mom!Russian lady says something.I black out....Whoever made Apples alarm clock needs to have the night I just had...a billion times. I feel around the bed for my phone. My eyes havent fully opened because Im afraid that once they do, my body will realize how tired it is. My memory is blurred, but theres no time to sit and think about anything. I find my phone, and click the button on the side. I open my eyes completely. The brightness causes me to hiss. Theres a text from Corrie.  Message: Stayed up all night studying for our math test. I better pass. Im so sleepy! What math test?CrapCrapCrapCrapCrapCrap This is my worst nightmare"
The Artist,"The unbearable thing about living is not so much  but . God put billions of us into the world and gave us all, as a joke, our own life and morals. The universe never planned on me, or you, only some specimens based on the original model. Like a car, each made of the same essential central engineering. The only difference being the license plate. For a human, the license plate is their face, the accidental and unrepeatable accumulation and assortment of features which reflects neither character nor soul. My face is a particularly ratty one, with big yellowish teeth. My eyes are quick and clever, like a rat's, and my ears are slightly pointed at the top. The few hairs left on my scalp are grey, again, like that of a rat, and when I am not in costume, my clothes are usually of a similar color.Everyday for the past fifty-something years Ive analyzed my visage through my small tabletop mirror, referring, with some slight aesthetic modifications, that very rodent face back onto a canvas. Throughout my years as a professional artist I have painted some twelve-thousand works. Despite the monotony, I cant say I love it any less than the first time I picked up a brush. There is a constancy to it that is extremely comforting to a person of routine and habit such as myself. I wake up early every morning, at precisely five-thirty, and make myself a strong cup of coffee. No sugar, no milk. As soon as the sun is up I go on my usual walk through the woods behind the house. I have done this for sixty years and at the age of eighty-eight, I can say it has done me some good. There's nothing like regularity for maintaining one's peace of mind. Whenever I am forced to exclude or exchange something out of my routine, such as with bad weather, it causes a certain upheaval within my body, like a new bird in a cage of canaries.At eleven oclock Caroline, my one and only friend  or better said, former friend  comes by to talk and make lunch. She is a very short woman, at least twenty years my junior, with an ashen face and a frosty, determined look which I used to appreciate. The lips are always pressed together and her large chest sticks out like a plump, ruffled bird. A week before she ruined our relationship with that self-obsessed character of hers, and sent me rushed to the hospital, she was making soup. I watched her put the pot on the stove and stir it with my long metal spoon until it came to the boil.As it simmered on the fire we spoke, per usual, about my work. I confess, for however long it lasted, she was excellent company. The bird-like creature was just as lonely as me. Just as desperate for human contact. And, had we met not four but twenty years ago, perhaps we could have been more than simply friends. But I diverge. As I said, Caroline was my only friend, and for a man such as myself, brimming with bright ideas and equally interesting theories, I was quick to tell her everything, despite my otherwise secretive nature. Secrecy was, after all, pivotal to my line of work.On that particular morning, a day before she handed me her so-called present and promptly destroyed our friendship, I was telling her about my most recent painting.I have positioned myself on a deck chair in front of a big, sloping hill in front of my house in Chianti. The grass is freshly mown, a nice parakeet green. On my right, I say, closing my eyes, envisioning the piece, on my right stand two rose bushes in full bloom. The scarlet begonias are out too, and so are the hybrid lupins and the irises. Somewhere off in the distance stands a mysterious figure. The gardener. Or, no, I think Ill call him the Messenger of Death. An artist, Caroline, must always be contemplating their death.Lovely, Caroline said admiringly, her small bird like eyes opening and closing quickly, like wings in flight, youve been very fond of your house in Chianti lately, havent you?As I said earlier, Caroline was excellent company. She instigated where I wanted to be questioned, expelled the things I did not want to address. And, most importantly, she was ready to believe anything.Of course, I do not have a house in Chianti. My entire body of work is a fraud and a lie. To those who knew the truth anyway. Which was nobody. That is the small price to pay for a lonely existence. You can mold and remold yourself however you please, and create your own immortality accordingly. For the past fifty years a secret plan had been brewing in my mind. After all, I live in Austria, the country of Freud. Like him, I wanted to create my own, distinctive causa-sui project. A personal stepping-stone towards inevitable success after my death. Like Van Gogh, Egon Schiele, Paul Gauguin, Amedeo Modigliani, Jean-Honore Fragonard. And in the process, give my life meaning beyond my life, and transcend my human limitations.To be mortal is the most basic of human experiences, and yet, if one is really truthful to themselves, we cannot accept it, grapple with it, and behave accordingly. Man simply does not know how to be . Can we be blamed? Every day our bodies show marks of our forthcoming demise. My obsession with immortality began when I was thirty, when I figured live wasnt worth the living anymore. Instead of killing myself (despite everything my  was incredibly strong), I decided to simply stop existing, and start preparing for my reputation when I was no longer around to defend it. Immortality, to me, meant being loved by strangers while I could not even love myself. It meant living in the admiration of women, children, men, yet to be born.Since then I have lived an isolated existence, alone in my small house here, in the outskirts of Vienna, and changed my name to Gnther Von Neumann. I sign all my paintings with the initials GVN, and the false letters I write to myself all start with that name also. Gnther the bachelor, Gnther the artist, Gnther the generous socialite, Gnther the flneur, the philosopher, the Austrian Gatsby.Caroline, the antisocial house cat, was the only person I shared my posthumous desires with. After all, we spoke everyday. As the broth sat on the stove, we made our way to the veranda, where I worked during the spring and summer months. The room was warm and clean, the curtain wide open, four easels each baring a canvas stood in every corner. Two were practically finished, two had strange red brush strokes painted on them, like Chinese characters. The art of painting is simply putting some strokes on a blank canvas. Its like having a drink before a date. It breaks the ice.Leaning up against the walls, some vertical, some horizontal, stacked on top of one another, were my canvases. At least three-hundred in that small room alone. Upstairs in the attic are another three-hundred, in my storage room, which is full to the brim, another four-hundred. Gnther is as generous in daily life as he is with painting. Gestural, quick, unsparing, slobs of paint cover the otherwise flat surfaces, none of which take me longer than a day or two to make.From my long veranda windows, one can see the garden. It is a fine garden, with a small pond and two rose bushes. The wind is strong during the spring, making the leaves hiss and crackle as if on fire. Though I rarely sit outside, I have two deck chairs, and a small white table for reading.This is the Chianti piece I was telling you about, I told her, pointing at one of the four easels.Its very beautiful. It fits perfectly with yesterdays pool scene.Thats what I thought as well. I wrote this postcard to go with it, I told her, handing her an envelope, with a stamp and everything, from Gnther to Rosalia. Never sent. I suspect people will wonder why he never did. Could it be a change of heart? A sudden bout of uncharacteristic anxiety? Did he hear a rumor? Was she getting married to someone else? Is there a new person in his life? Really, the options are endless.Its incredibly romantic.It is, isnt it? Tomorrow I plan on taking Gnther and several of his male friends to a party in Florence. That night he will return home entirely drunk, and create a very fun, quick little canvas of his evening.Incredible.In a small journal Caroline jotted down everything I said. Her thin fingers darting from one side of the page to the other, like a mouse trapped in a small room. Though at first I had been hesitant, the written word was a dangerous thing if used against you, I also knew she was just as lonely as me, even more so. At least I had my cat.After speaking for some twenty, thirty minutes, she got up and went to the kitchen while I put the finishing touches on the Chianti scene. I could hear her cutting the vegetables and putting them into the broth. Some onions, a few potatoes, a handful of carrots. I was incredibly grateful for her presence, and found myself missing her dearly whenever she left.After lunch we said our goodbyes. I slept for some two, three hours, legs neatly placed on my ottoman, both arms crossed on my chest, snoring. Then at four I made myself a strong cup of whisky to get myself ready for Gnthers party scene. After three hours of concentrated work, I signed the piece, ate the leftover soup, and went to bed, satisfied. The next morning I awoke at exactly five-thirty, made myself a strong cup of coffee, no sugar, no milk, as always. As soon as the sun came up I went on my usual walk through the woods behind the house, and waited for Caroline to arrive with her groceries.She was in an especially chipper mood, she chirped about this and that, and practically flew from one spot in the kitchen to the other. For the first time in four years she hardly let me speak. I admit, it was she who had, again, reminded me of my birthday. I liked Gnthers birthdate more, which was in the colder, more romantic autumn months. Far better than June. But Caroline preferred keeping to my own, and throughout our friendship she always came with a cake and made my favorite dish: Ksesptzle, which was simultaneously the clogger of my arteries and the reason my heart beat. The strong odor of cheese and onions hung in the air and made me salivate.I have a present here with me. I can hardly wait to give it to you, she said.What is it? A canvas?The package was small and rectangular, wrapped in some newspaper, and had Caroline not given it such importance I would have overlooked it entirely.Of course not, you have enough of those. No, this is something  created for .From then onwards I forgot about the small box completely. For one, I had the Ksesptzle on my mind, and two, she simply wasnt the creative type. That was me. In my mind, anything she made had the same appeal as a cat with a dead bird in its mouth.Lunch was excellent. For a short moment. She had mellowed down, how I liked her, and I was pleased to finally get some stage time to talk. I told her a long, and if I dare say, riveting story about Gnthers evening, and subsequent morning, which I read to her from his diary, like a snooping wife. The night before he had met a woman with a round, tanned face, tight and glimmering with subtle inward strength that was beautiful beyond words, and at which he stared all evening.I spoke for a long time. All the while Caroline seemed to coil into herself, as if jealously safeguarding a secret. In hindsight, I should have known her light grey eyes moved too quickly about the room, without her usual diligence and attendance, never settling on one thing for more than a moment. If I had been more observant, I would have noticed those small, faint upturned lines of anticipation placed neatly on both sides of her mouth.Oh, I simply cannot wait any longer, she said, as soon as I was done reading, please open the present.Right now? I said, annoyed. What could possibly be more important than Gnthers love life?Please.Well, alright then.I weighed the gift in my hands, then shook it. It was light, but not too light, flexible, but not too flexible. It was almost definitely a book. Perhaps she thought I could find some inspiration in it for my next work. I opened it slowly, trying not to break the wrapper, though it was only newspaper.The cover bore one of my own paintings. A long dining table, laid out for a feast. Tall candles stood at equidistance from one another, becoming periodically smaller and less detailed as they disappeared into the distance. A great magnitude of shining silverware, three wine glasses per person, white table clothe and silk serviettes.The title of the book was  Under stood her name in shining white letters: Caroline Bauer. I reread the title several times over before the magnitude of the situation settled on me. A  existence? Now everyone would know. That weasely, inhuman, rat of a woman. She had stolen my immortality from me. She had taken it with both hand, threaded it, then day by day unraveled it, and spun it into a web of her own. There I stood, at the age of eighty-nine, my death bed calling my name, stripped from the very thing keeping me alive for all those years. I was incredibly upset, I felt my breathe escape my nostrils in angry whiffs of air. At the same time, I couldnt help but laugh. A strange cackling noise which scared even me. For as long as I could remember, I had tried to outrun my existential fears by painting a life which was not my own. In reality, all my work would have meant nothing more than a dinosaurs distant cry anyway. Tears no one would remember. Perhaps I should have focused on living instead of dying while I was still alive.I wanted to wait until your birthday to give it to you. Its been in circulation for the past five months. Its a best-seller! Youll never have to worry about being forgotten again! I am writing the sequel as we speak."
Postcards and Lemon Shortbread,"""Who buys post cards these days - let alone sends them?"" Sandy took off her hat and started using it as a fan. It was approaching midday, it was August and over forty degrees. She longed to be sitting by the pool under a sunshade. Instead of which Malcolm had dragged her round the shops. 	""They're old school, the aunts,"" said Malcolm. ""They expect a postcard."" 	""I suppose these pictures are rather lovely."" There was one of the little bay they'd found and adopted as their own. ""You've taken some really nice photos yourself. Why don't you just put them up on Insta? Then they can help themselves."" 	Malcolm chuckled. ""Aunt Ada and Aunt Brenda looking at Insta? You're joking, aren't you?"" 	""Your dad would show them, wouldn't he?"" 	""They'd never go near the computer or Dad's phone. Aunt Ada says they're instruments of the Devil. Dad's not much better himself. He gets all of a bluster trying to find things. Talking of which, we'd better get him and Mum one as well."" 	Sandy shook her head and tutted. 	Malcolm selected three cards and went into the shop to pay. Sandy amused herself looking at some of the serious photos of the islands. 	A few moments later, Malcolm came out of the shop clutching a paper bag. He was frowning.	""What's up?"" 	""I'd only got enough cash for the cards and two stamps. Their card machine is broken."" 	Sandy shrugged. ""It's no big deal, is it? We can pick up another one next time we're passing."" 	Malcolm nodded. That afternoon they sat by the pool and Malcolm wrote his postcards. When it got a bit cooler, he walked to the nearest post box and posted the two that had stamps. Aunt Ada's would have to wait until they could get the other stamp. ""Put this one in your bag,"" he said to Sandy, when he got back. ""Hopefully we'll remember to get a stamp and post it next time we're in town."" 	""Wouldn't it be better to post them all at the same time?""	Malcolm shrugged. ""I doubt whether they'll all arrive at the same time anyway. You know, Greek postal system and Royal Mail and all."" 	Only there wasn't a next time. The temperature went up to over forty-six degrees. They were advised to stay indoors. Then it became even more dangerous and a little bit scary; their little town was surrounded by wildfires. Sandy was glad when it was time to go home. 	The journey home was very smooth in the end. The fires between their hotel and the airport had been brought under control. Their flight was on time. It landed on time as well and soon they were home unpacking. 	It was as she went to put her passport away that she discovered the unsent postcard in her handbag. ""We did post this, you know."" 	Malcolm hit his forehead in mock horror. ""There'll be trouble.""	Right on cue the telephone rang.	""Hi Mum."" 	""I'm glad you like them."" 	""Well we did, but we didn't get the chance to post hers.""	""We have, yes."" 	""That wouldn't fool her, would it?""	""For goodness sake, it's only a postcard."" 	""Yes, of course we will. We always do, don't we?"" 	""So, we'll just have to put up with that won't we?"" 	""Yes. Will do. Bye.""	""Your mum?"" 	Malcolm nodded. 	""She sounded a bit upset."" 	""Yes, she was cross. Because Aunt Ada's upset that Mum and Dad and Aunt Brenda got postcards and she didn't. And you know what Mum suggested? That as we have the postcard still, one of us should put it through their letter box one morning. What do you think?""	""That's a daft idea."" Why couldn't he see that? 	""Oh?""	""Well for starters, their post doesn't come until the afternoon. Then there wouldn't be a stamp on it. You can't put an English one on it. Your Aunt Ada isn't daft. And we might even be seen. You know those two are early risers.""	""Well, we'll have to think of something. They're expecting us as usual on Sunday afternoon."" 	They would be!	Couldn't they tell the truth and be done with it? ""Why don't we 'fess up and just give her the card?""	Malcolm raised both eyebrows. ""Really? You do know what Aunt Ada's like, don't you?""	Yes she did. And that was what made it all a bit more puzzling. ""So, why didn't you hold Aunt Brenda's card back instead?"" Malcolm's Aunt Brenda was much more reasonable than her sister.	Malcolm frowned. ""I'm not really sure. I guess I like to live dangerously?""	""Anyway you more or less said it yourself. The postal system's unreliable. We'll just have to say it was lost in the post.""	""I suppose so."" 	""Shall I smooth it over with your mum?"" 	""Yes please."" He pulled her towards him and kissed the top of her head. ""What would I do without you?"" 	""Get into even more trouble,"" Sandy muttered.  ""Yes, I think that's for the best, Sandy love. We'll just have to tell her that you did send a card, but that it must have got lost in the post. Hopefully she'll be happy enough with that.""	""I expect she'll forget all about it in time."" 	Tricia chuckled. ""I wouldn't be so sure about that. She'll never let Malcolm hear the last of it. Anyway we'll all do our best. You're a good lass.I do hope that son of mine appreciates you."" 	""Thank you, Tricia. See you soon."" 	Malcolm looked up at her when she'd finished the call. 	""Mum okay with that?"" 	""Yea. As okay as she can be. Brace yourself for Sunday."" Aunt Brenda opened the door to them on Sunday afternoon. She greeted them with her usual sunny smile. She was wearing jeans and a check shirt - very understated for a Sunday for Aunt Brenda - and she seemed more cheerful than normal. Had Aunt Ada been a bit kinder to her today?	""I'm afraid your Aunt Ada's a bit out of sorts,"" she said as she led them into the lounge. The china plates and tea things were all set out. Aunt Brenda's tempting Victoria sponge was already there but Aunt Ada's fine lemon shortbread was clearly missing. 	Aunt Ada herself sat there, wrapped up in a pink woollen shawl. Her eyes were red. It looked as if she'd been crying. ""Very generous of you to come and see me, I'm sure. Well I expect, you were too busy having a nice time to even write a postcard."" 	""Oh Ada, now tut, tut,"" said Aunt Brenda. ""Of course they weren't too busy having a nice time. Look at the lovely card they sent me."" She pointed to the mantelpiece. 	Ah, so he'd sent his Aunt Brenda the one of the little cove. 	""It was lovely there,"" said Sandy. ""We went to that little beach quite a lot until we had to stay in because it was too hot and because of the fires.""	""The fires? Oh that doesn't sound very nice,"" said Aunt Brenda. ""What were these fires?"" 	""Wildfires,"" Malcolm explained. ""Fires that had got out of control. They didn't know whether people had started them deliberately or whether it was just people being careless.""	""There you are you see,"" said Aunt Brenda.	""There's how I'm supposed to see what?"" snapped Aunt Ada.	""That must be what happened to your postcard.""	""What did?"" 	""It must have got burnt in the fire.""	""Oh you silly woman, what are you prattling on about?"" Aunt Ada sniffed and took a large white hanky from up her sleeve and blew her nose noisily. 	Aunt Brenda looked at Sandy and Malcolm. 	Sandy bit her lip. Malcolm shrugged. 	""That's what Tricia told me I must tell you."" 	""What? That my postcard got burnt in a fire? And that hers and yours didn't? How would that happen?""	""No. She said I was to tell you that they'd sent you a post card and that it must be lost in the post."" 	Aunt Ada screwed her eyes up and looked straight at Sandy and Malcolm. ""Did you? Did you write me a post card and put in the post box? With the right postage on it? Because I don't want to have to pay for it if it eventually turns up."" 	""That's right, Aunt Ada. We wrote three postcards. They sell the stamps with the post cards. So that the tourists get it right."" 	But they hadn't posted three, had they? Sandy could bear it no longer. She'd still got the postcard in her bag. She opened it and fumbled inside. Yes, there it was. She started taking it out. 	""What are you doing?"" hissed Malcolm.	""It's about time we told the truth,"" Sandy whispered back. 	""What are you two fighting about?"" asked Aunt Ada. ""What's that you've got in your hand? Is that a postcard?"" 	Malcolm leapt to his feet and glared at Sandy. ""Yes. It's just like the one we bought you. Sandy liked it so much she bought another copy of it.""	He paused dramatically just as he was about to hand over to his aunt. ""Oh, you idiot Sandy. This Aunt Ada's card. You must have posted your one.""	Aunt Ada took the card from him. She studied the picture for a few seconds and then turned it over. 	""Well, what does it say?"" asked Aunt Brenda. ""Aren't you going to read it out to us?"" 	Aunt Ada sighed. Then she started reading ""Dear Aunt Ada, Sandy and I are enjoying the sun here. We've visited this lighthouse. It reminded me a bit of the one near that campsite we used to go to in the summer holidays. I think you'd like it. We're looking forward to telling you all about it when we get back - and of course we're looking forward to some of your famous lemon short bread. Love Malc."" 	""Hmm. You like lighthouses, do you?"" Aunt Ada was looking right into Sandy's eyes. 	""Oh yes. I love them"" 	She was lying again. She hated them. All those steps. And the way they spelt danger. She always thought that if you were near enough to a lighthouse to see it properly you were already in the wrong place. And she hated that one in particular. The stairs had been so narrow and when she'd got to the top and looked down she'd felt dizzy. 	""Well that's good to know, anyway,"" said Aunt Ada. ""So, when you come next week I can show you some of the photos of the lighthouse he's on about. If that other one turns up I can give it back to you. As long as you pay any excess postage, of course. And I'll make some of my lemon shortbread."" She turned to Aunt Brenda. ""And I hope you'll dress a bit more smartly when we have company, you scruffy mutt.""	Aunt Brenda lowered her eyes and shrank."
Paradise on Earth,"It was a long day at work which Susie loved doing just to get away from home. Susie's had so much responsibility on her that she didn't even feel married. Life started slowly consuming Susie and she had no outlet so she became bitter. Susie would sometimes cry in her room because she wasn't happy. Susie kept feeling like something was missing. Susie loved her family and was very loyal to them and her life was good. Susie was raised in the church all of her life and couldn't wait to stop going! Susie was made to go to church all the time as a child which made her faith strong. Susie had a lot of fear because of childhood issues and attacks on her as a young adult. Susie also had many close relatives to pass in her life such as dad, grandmother, uncle and so on. Susie's way of coping with these things was road rage and going off on others! Although this was toxic it was the only thing Susie could think of to do. She had forgotten about her faith along the way of life's struggles. Susie started to see the marriage was toxic and not serving her. Susie's son got shot by a group of troubled youth. This was the most traumatic experience of all. Susie didn't feel protected even with her husband. This was the straw that broke the camel's back! Susie knew this was a warning from God to change her life! Not only her life but her family's lives as well. What we do not only affects us but our loved ones as well. Susie cried and cried about this decision because she had been married for 17 years! Susie didn't know how she would support herself because she had become dependent on her husband's income. At this point Susie didn't care because she started back talking to God. Susie got a job and succeeded at providing for the household with God's help! Susie's lease was almost up and she knew she had to move from that house with those painful memories. Susie moved when her lease was expired and got an apartment instead of a house. Susie and her sons began healing from the trauma one day at a time. Susie struggled with wanting revenge on her son's attacker to the point she couldn't sleep. Susie knew in her spirit this wasn't right and had to teach her son who struggled with the same thoughts. Susie had to tell God about her family's struggles because only God could help them! Susie prayed constantly and worked and before she knew it those thoughts were gone. Susie still had to constantly teach this method of forgiveness and giving it to God to her. It was not easy to come back from a bullet but he still was alive. Susie was grateful God said no he will live and not die. Susie and her son went to trial that year and out of the four people involved they charged one and gave him four years. What a slap in the face that a person can try to kill you and get four years! This was truly a disgraceful system who showed Susie they didn't care. The bullet grazed his face and went into his right shoulder. Susie had to let go and let God to have peace and a somewhat normal life. Susie and her family continued to live life and receive life's blessings. They moved from those apartments and into a better area were we felt safe to finish healing our trauma. Susie stopped smoking weed and cigarettes which kept me in toxic situations longer. Susie's only brother had passed and Susie went into isolation. Susie was full of pain and remorse. One year after that Susie filed for her divorce once her baby boy was 18 years old. All he ever knew was mom and dad and by him being older it wasn't as painful. Susie cried so much and her heart was broken because she loved her husband! She realized that she had been putting him before herself and it didn't feel good! Susie was not being her true self by sitting back letting someone else run her life. Susie went through soul searching, meditation and shadow work! Susie read a book on boundaries and the full life frame work from Lifehack. Susie's life started slowly getting better. She didn't go outside much and she gave my husband back his truck. Susie felt like a loser and that she wasted all those years on him. She started watching psychics on utube and received answers she searched for her whole life. Susie's thought process and her heart started to change. She had visions of my brother, dad and grandmother in her dreams. Susie got to hug them to know they were okay and that helped her heal fast. Susie started to get more messages through the cards. She absolutely loved hearing from her Angels and loved ones. This spoke to Susie in a beautiful way and warned and gave Susie advice. These were things her intuition was already telling her! Susie began to see the beauty in everything and everyone. She recognize the blessing that came through the trauma of pain. It was a new beginning for her full of new possibilities! Susie thanked God for the air that she breathe, the trees,sun, moon, animals, water, and life! She thank God for my journey and the lessons from the journey! She thank God that she was always loved and supported by God even when she thought she was alone! Susie was grateful for forgiveness and love that she was given so she give it back! Instead of complaining about God's paradise that was created for us, Susie was in love with life again! Susie learned to never put anything before God and to appreciate all things in life.  Susie no longer carried around resentment, anger or bitterness.  Susie took on the fruits of the Spirit which are love, joy, peace, fruitfulness.  Susie started helping others in her apartments with gifts, knowledge and love.  Susie was usually introverted but decided to step out on faith.  Fear was no longer apart of Susie's life because she knew God was always in control and not her! Elisa Wells"
Inner Voice,"Inner VoiceRohan opened his eyes slowly to see himself in the mirror maze. He thinks, How did I end up here. He looks around and sees him surrounded by his own reflections. He tries to remember how he ended up here. He gets a glimpse of his chemistry class. He mildly remembers that he was in the chemistry lab doing some classwork. He can say by the look it is mirror maze, but this does not belong in the school. He slowly starts to walk forward and tries to find a way out of the maze. As he passes by many set of mirrors, he notices an odd thing. There were three mirrors that did not reflect him; instead, he saw his sixth-grade chemistry teacher Mr. Rahul, his crush Riya and his best friend Rohit. Rohan wonders why these three mirrors are not reflecting him. And why is it reflecting these three person in peculiar while the other mirrors are reflecting him. He moves towards those mirrors. And takes a glance at all three and he decides to first approach his Chemistry teachers mirror.So he first approaches to Mr. Rahuls mirror and touches it. Soon a bright light blinds him. Then it fades away. He could see his sixth-grade chemistry lab and see his own childhood self, trying on some chemical combination. He then realizes that he is in the body of his chemistry teacher Mr. Rahul. Though Rohan was in Rahuls body, he controlled neither his body nor mind. Rohan was able to hear Rahuls inner voice. Every year, I come across many new students. Though they remember me or not but I still remember each one of them thinks Mr. Rahul. Then he looks at Rohan as the chemical apparatus slips Rohans hand and falls down. It shatters into pieces. Rahul approaches Rohan.I know this part, Rohan thinks. This is where I get scolded like never before till now in my life. Then Rohan hears Mr.Rahuls inner voice. Poor child is he ok, I scolded him very much. I feel sorry for that, but he has to be more careful. He reminds me of my son. That is why I had to scold him. I am not sure how he took it. If my son was alive he would be the same age of his.I thought him to be the worst teacher in my entire school life. I thought he never had a conscience and the rudest teacher. However, he considered me his son. I never knew he had a softer side. Moreover, I feel sorry for his son. After this my thought on him has changed, thinks Rohan. The surroundings slowly fade away and he returns to the mirror maze. Next Rohan moves towards Riyas mirror and touches it. He sees the same chemistry lab from Riyas perspective.Should I ask him for a group study? I am so afraid. What if he rejects me? But he studies better than me and has good grades. Only once, he had helped me with the chemistry lessons. I have not spoken to him other than that once. He is the only person that was kind to me. Rohan listens to Riyas inner voice. Everybody thinks me as bad luck. If I am to speak with him, nobody will be his friend ever again. I know how it feels to be alone and would not let it to happen to anyone. Even my mother thinks of me as a curse and my father died because of me.I never knew Riya wanted to become my friend. I thought she only like the sportive boys, but never knew she had this bad luck idea in her mind and even her mother believes in it. She thinks me to be the kindest person in the entire world. But I have been mean by not understanding her feelings. runs in Rohans mind. Riya makes up her mind to ask Rohan for a group study. She slowly approaches him. Then she sees Rohan dropping the apparatus and Mr. Rahul approaching him. Riya stands a few feet away from Rohan and watches everything happening. She feels sorry for what happened to Rohan. She thinks she is the reason for the things that happened to him because of her bad luck. She decides not to think of him ever again, for his own safety.Rohan slowly comes out of her inner voice and back to the mirror maze. Finally, he approaches Rohits mirror. Again, Rohan is back to the same chemistry lab but now in Rohits mind. Rohan sees Rohit applying some kind of lubricant to an apparatus and placing it unnoticed on Rohans table. Rohit thinks, Rohan do you think you are so intelligent because every time I get a lower grade than you, my mother always scolds me when comparing me with you. Everyone wants to be your friend. So I have filled this apparatus with toxic gas, so when it falls down and breaks. Everyone in the class, including you will be affected by the gas. You have to take the entire blame.Rohan returns to the mirror maze. He thought Rohit to be his best friend in the entire world but he has betrayed him. Just because I am a bit better than you doesnt make you worse. Your mother scolds you by comparing me to you, is to make you take the effort I take. But not to take a revenge on me, thinks Rohan.Rohan finds himself in an ambulance, because of an accident in the chemistry lab. He asks the treating nurse if everyone is ok. She replies, You are the only one who is most hurt, others are only mildly hurt. Rohan thinks, I am not hurt by the wound but I am hurt by the betrayal. The entire world is seen from our perspective. However, once when we start seeing from other's perspectives, we will be astonished by the secrets that it holds."
The Woodsman and the Wolf,"The frost lingering longer in the mornings let me know that winter was closing in on us yet again.I liked to blame the frost for my aching bones, for my need to linger under the covers next to my wifes warm body.I had worked out in the woods all my life.I was used to the toll of being a woodsman.Never once did I think to blame the stiffness in my shoulders or my back on my advancing years.I would drop dead wielding an ax if it pleased God. A gentle laugh beside me served as a reminder that I had yet to rise from the bed.Your sons have already taken themselves to the woods, Jean.I can hear their axes in the distances. So can I, I whispered as another round of tapping echoed through the window. I left some bread and cheese on the table for you, my wife told me.She twisted off her back to her side, taking with her the quilt we shared.The cold made me shiver, but in the same breath, it forced me to my feet to find my tunic and my trousers.I gathered them as quickly as my aging body allowed, dressing to the steady rhythm of my wifes breathing.I descended the ladder from our loft to the main room to find a small sack resting on the table as promised.I smiled, my dearest Isabelle knew me too well.As I walked towards the door, I snatched the small sack from its resting place and stuffed it into my coat pocket before I put it on.Next, I slid my feet into my boots and stepped outside. I kept my ax hanging on the wall next to the door on the porch, along with every other tool I used for my trade.My sons had already gathered their own saws and axes.No doubt they would have a tree already felled by the time I arrived.My body would appreciate it in the morning the fewer trees I chopped down.I grabbed my blade off its hook and followed the sound of the tapping of an ax against a tree trunk.  A short time later, the tree crashed to the ground and my boys cheered that they had not been caught under the thick trunk.I whispered a prayer that my boys had not gotten hurt.God knows how many times I had seen my fellow woodsmen lose either life or limb thanks to a falling tree.We spent the morning cutting the tree down, stacking it for our employer to gather later. Near the noon hour, I caught a glimpse of a red cloak in the woods.Everyone in the village knew who wore that cloak: the headmans daughter.She only wore in the woods, when she was on her way to her grandmothers cottage, so us woodsmen could see her better.I watched her for a moment before joining my sons again in work.We stayed busy for another hour until my sons growling stomachs could stand their hunger no more.Three stumps stood around a small fire pit, embers still steaming from the fire my boys had lit on their arrival to keep warm. I saw a wolf earlier, my eldest boy Alain boasted as we ate. So did I, Denis, my other son, agreed with a nod.I think weve seen more this year than ever before. Do you think its a sign, papa? Alain asked. I frowned.Omens are the devils work, lad.Lets do our best not to attract his attention. I left it at that.I refused to think of the news I had heard from the world outside our village.For a number of years, people had been dying by the hundreds.Thank God this plague had yet to visit us, and I prayed our Lord would continue to smile upon us.Fewer people meant fewer hunters, which left more for the wolves.Every year it seemed the wolves grew bolder and bolder.I heard many whispers every time I made the trek into town: one wolf could eat an entire man and still be hungry.A part of me knew those whispers were outrageous but another part of me feared it to be true.But not once would I speak those words out loud to my sons.We refused to linger long after we filled our stomachs.We had more trees to cut down, more firewood to cut up.As we worked, I kept glancing towards the path, to watch for the headmans daughter.I had watched her trek to her grandmothers house enough times to know how long she stayed: no more than two hours passed the noon hour.So when I didnt see her after the third hour, I put a stop to our work. Go check on your mother, lads, I ordered. What is it, Papa? Denis asked. I have not seen the little girl in the red riding hood head back home from her grandmothers house, I admitted.  Neither boy needed any more encouragement.Both my sons grabbed their axes and ran towards our house.I picked up my own ax and followed the little girls path to her grandmothers cottage.Along the trail she had taken, I spotted her little boot prints.To my horror, I found wolf prints next to hers.Mon Dieu, I whispered as I forced my legs to sprint towards the old womans house. I reached the edge of the house as two voices screamed over a growl and snarl.With all my strength I kicked the door open to find the child and her grandmother being chased around the house by the largest wolf I had ever seen.My entry startled all three of them.I thanked God that the feral beast turned its attention on me, giving the child and old woman a chance to race out of the house to safety. The wolf snarled at me through narrow eyes.If I did not act quickly, it would attack me.Though I would prefer to get through this unharmed, if it meant that little girl and her grandmother stayed unharmed, I would endure whatever harm this beast did to me.Once or twice the wolf made short bursts at me, forcing me to step back towards the door.The third time it tried to attack me, I hit it with the blade of my ax on the forehead.I struck the beast hard enough to knock it out.As it collapsed to the ground, both my boys rushed inside. Help me, lads, I ordered.Lets get this foul creature outside and killed. It took all three of us to drag the creature from the house into the woods.My son Alain chopped the head from the body once we had a hole dug in the ground.I left the burial to my sons as I went in search of the little girl and her grandmother.I found them halfway to my own house.I smiled at them, letting them know the wolf had been taken care of. Please, come rest in my cottage, I said.Ill send my sons into town to alert the headman. I walked them to the door of my house where my wife waited, her face pale.She sighed in relief at the sight of us and begged for our guests to join us inside.In a heartbeat, Isabelle had the little girl wrapped in a thick blanket and sitting in an oversized chair in front of the fire.Near dusk, her father arrived at our door to hear me recount the events of the day to him personally with my sons dangling on my every word. I thank God you were nearby, Master Jean, the headman told me.I smiled.In these times, we must look out for each other.Ill see that your mas house is properly fixed so no other wolves can get inside myself. The headman thanked me again before gathering up his little daughter in his arms and escorting his mother back to the village where she would stay until we fixed her house."
Tick Tock Croc,"Tick Tock Croc	I could not take my eyes off Pixie Hollow, the island where the fairies live, it was beautiful, always glittering with gold pixie dust. It has become a habit of mine to admire their fantastic island from my boring one, Croc Creek, but today is different, today is the day I visit Pixie Hollow.	Mama Odie, the Voodoo priestess, promised every creature in Croc Creek one wish, provided they present an outstanding gift to her. It seemed like a fair deal, I had asked creatures who had visited Mama Odie, for gift ideas. They all told me to go big and glamorous, to find rare herbs or artifacts. So I decided to give her the rare glass flower. I searched the highs and lows of Croc Creek to find her the glass flower.	At mothers, the aroma of her famous feather hat stew was eluding, making me nostalgic. I remembered the first time she cooked her stew, its uniquely delicious taste, the taste mother claimed to have come from the hand of a white feather hat pirate. This stew is the major reason I wanted to go to Pixie Hollow because it is my dream to be a chef at Pixie Hollow. Ordinarily I would not be allowed to become a chef because of gender roles that insisted males hunt while females cook. But since I swallowed an alarm clock when I was three, it had earned me the name Tick Tock Croc as well as made me too noisy to hunt.	Mother only cooked her special stew on special occasions, making me curious about what we were celebrating. I walked closer to the source of the aroma to ask mother about the celebration. She began to tell me about how she dreamt I would become a talented chef. It was not until she unwrapped the luminous glass flower from a napkin that I understood.	After eating mothers stew I set out for Mama Odies. It was a long way down the Creek but every step felt worth it. I was overwhelmed with joy, I was finally going to be a chef in Pixie Hollow. As I approached the entrance of Mama Odies shrine, I heard an old screeching voice call my name. A three feet figure with a snake around her neck emerged from the shadows.	What do you want Tick Tock Croc she hissed.	With all the courage in me, I presented the flower and told her I would like to go to Pixie Hollow. The snake on her neck let out a loud laugh, and without a second glance, Mama Odie said, Joinem with the rest while signaling to form my flower to a huge flower vase of glass flowers. I was devastated, Mama Odie rejected the flower I had searched endlessly for and most importantly denied me my ticket to Pixie Hollow. She told me to return when I find a more valuable gift for her.	Walking out of Mama Odies shrine was a moment I had fantasized about for years, I fantasized myself skipping out, to jubilate with my family. Yet I was walking out with my head down in bewilderment. I walked lazily to the highest part of the creek to look at Pixie Hollow. As I got to the top I heard a voice hiss my name, it was Mama Odies snake, Juju. he coiled beside me, staring at Pixie Hollow.	You know Juju started Mama O doesnt hate you she just wants you to give from your heart not your mind.	I looked at him shocked that he thought my glass flower was not from my heart.	I searched tirelessly for itfor years, I said, almost yelling at Juju.	Juju signed, Your heart not your mind. he repeated.	In that instant I was a ship approaching the shores of the island. And there it was a pirate in a white feather hat. The idea immediately struck me to make Mama Odie mothers feather hat stew. I rushed to the harbor to meet the feather hat pirate in an intense duo with a flying boy in green. The ship was in chaos, children were tied up to a pole, while some were ferociously fighting the ships crew, and a fairy was struggling in a lamp case. My gaze returned to the pirate, I waited impatient for him to fall into the water. The flying boy put one of his hands behind his back, dearing the pirate with his short dagger. The tied up children were free and the ship's chaos increased. Finally, the pirate tripped, falling straight into my mouth. I could hear the children on the ship cheering me on as I forced the stubborn pirate into my mouth. The pirate fought Yelling ""smee! at every move he made. I continued to chase him to the middle of the ocean.	If my day could not get any worse, I watched as whale emerge from the sea with its mouth open swallowing the pirate. I was lucky to have not been eaten, but I was so angry that the whale had swallowed my only shot at getting my dream.	I swam home slowly while trying to accept my heartbreak. Thinking about how I would never become a chef at Pixie Hollow. As I approached Croc Creek I heard stage sounds like drums beating and creatures singing. There was a party and all the creatures of the creek were jubilating alongside the boy in green, the cheering children and a fairy. I crept quietly away from the party, but Juju saw me and yelled: He is here!	The whole crowd shifted to face me then they began to parade towards me. They cheered me on saying I was courageous enough to chase the pirate which they called captain hook away from terrorizing the whole of Neverland. The fairy even offered to take me to Pixie Hollow to become a chef.	So there I was admiring my to be home from the shores of Croc Creek."
Passing Time,"The sunflowers had bloomed the week prior, the heat pulling them higher with each passing day, touching the sky with what seemed to be sheer elegance. Claire admired them as she slowly paced the perimeter of the garden, her fingertips grazing the tops of the purple hull peas. The breeze picked up a bit, pulling strands of her blond hair from her back braid and guiding them in an unsynchronized dance. It delivered a scent of the gardenia from the back porch to the far end of the garden where she now stood watching the birds sway in and out, weaving intricate patterns. She had always loved gardenia, it was a beautiful flower and smelled sweet like momma.I watched her through the dirt-spattered glass that served as my window to my bedroom fort that I had begged her to help me with before she left the swing door clapping in my face. With hurt feelings I tried to push myself to follow in her footsteps out towards the empty chicken houses through ankle deep grass in bare feet, but I was not in the mood for sweat and bugs. I would rather be in my room creating my own world to escape to, much like the garden was hers. The two of us used to set up royal tea parties and sail our imaginary ship through loch ness infested lagoons. Things were different now though. All alone on a deserted island, I searched for a rescue.It seemed that hours had passed since Claire had darted away from the soon to be tear filled eyes of her little sister. She despised herself for being so harsh with her at times. Things had changed since mama had passed and Claire just wanted to run, all of the time. Running away started trickling through her mind, sounding like a good idea if only she would not have to leave her baby sister with the monster their step-father had turned into since the alcohol served as his only supporter through his grieving. Even though she was aware that it was not an option she would catch herself fantasizing about it daily. The sun drifted down slowly and fire flies blinked a graceful rhythm, one only she could hear.Homemade biscuits and meatloaf were a thing of the past now, and I deeply missed the smell of breakfast waking me up in the morning followed by the gentle ring of mama's voice coming down the hallway knocking on my door. Now it was a microwaved T.V. dinner or left overs from the church that we no longer attended. Dirty dishes lay in the sink for days, only adding to the stench that seemed to echo from the unmopped floors and the bathtub's clogged drain. I guessed that was why Claire spent so much time outside, at least out there she could smell the gardenia that momma had planted years before we had come along. It seemed that was a part of her she left behind that still lived on with us, along with the parts of the garden that were not yet overtaken by weeds.Claire made her way back up to the house that seemed to frown at the sight of her with her head down. The grass was damp between her toes, flossing out dirt from the garden's edge. Upon the return to the back door of the shell of a home that her sister caged herself in, she told herself it was only a temporary visit until tomorrow. Tomorrow would once again bring the key to her freedom that stretched further than the eye could see. It wasn't much of an escape but it was better than the hell the inside of the house had become. Praying silently that her step-father was asleep, Claire pushed the door open with a faint  and then closed it behind her locking it with the hook latch.It was dark out and I laid on my bed flipping through a highlight's magazine, pretending I had not solved the puzzles a hundred times already. The lava lamp in the corner of the room grabbed my attention with its pink liquid floating to the top and then racing back down to the bottom through the purple water that incased it. It reminded me of the roller coaster ride that my life had turned into recently. I watched the repetition a few times before Claire opened the bedroom door, grinning at me with her hands behind her back.The fire flies always made Claire think of her little sister. So before going inside for the night she picked the cleanest mason jar from the shed and found a lid that already had holes poked in it from the last home she had made for them. She captured a few and snuck the jar inside under her dress. Claire could not wait to see the look on her sister's face as she quietly walked down the hall passed the room that her mother used too sleep in. A twist of the door knob and quick spin on her heel, Claire was in her bedroom with the jar in hand. Without fail her little sister smiled from ear to ear with excitement at such a gift.I watched as the fire flies flew in different directions, bumping into the glass looking for a way out. They sort of reminded me of myself constantly running into the walls of my bedroom in attempt to get out of the house that was made for me by a strange giant. I could see what was out there waiting for me but yet I was held back by some invisible field of protection that was made up by age and circumstances.Claire laid in bed after stepping into her pajamas with Halloween cats on them. She watched as the blinking lights in the jar got a little lighter with each minute that passed. The sun had set for the evening and the bugs in their new home had done the same. Claire closed her eyes and forced a dream of when things were still brighter.Until tomorrow..."
Moony,"It was a night like any other and, unfortunately, the loud activity of the night made it quite difficult to catch onto a dream and drift off to sleep. But a little girl knew better than to chase her dreams, anyway.	A howl from a stray dog mixed in with natures nightly lullaby. The crashing of ocean waves sounded like cymbals against the shore and the whistling of the wind was frighteningly similar to that of a sigh or a forlorn echo.	Time stood still during this single magical moment. However, the usual pale body of light seen at this hour was temporarily shrouded by the dense clouds.	A little girl, roughly nine years old, laid wide awake in her small spring bed. She was waiting for the ancient grandfather clock downstairs in the orphanages main hall to strike midnight with its customary ring. That strike would (hopefully) announce the arrival of a friendly stranger.	Her little heart beat in a steady rhythm, like a song in itself, gently pulling her into a deep sleep. The girls eyes fluttered close on their own accord.	A second or possibly a minute later, she roused and scolded herself. It was a close call; too close. She couldnt drift off, though the temptation was strong. She made a promise to him and wasnt willing to break it.	The gentle thrum of a whirring fan above cooled her slightly moist face. She was grateful for it and shifted her position on the bed. A soft , courtesy of the old springs in the bed, echoed along the orphanage girls packed dormitory.	Tucked inside the crook of the girls right elbow was a small handcrafted doll she christened with the name Margit, after one of her favorite late grandmothers. The dolls cheeks were a soft rosy pink with seaweed green eyes stitched carefully into the felt. A tangled mop of blonde curls spilled out everywhere.	Margit was a spitting image of the girls own appearance. After all, the doll was designed to be a replica of its owner. The girl was very lucky her orphanage was more lenient than most. They let the girls keep their belongings and even gave them an education. Anyway, Margit was a birthday present from last year when the girl turned eight years old.	On that birthday she still had two living parents and a little brother. Oh, how very much could change in a mere three hundred and six days.	At the thought of her loved ones, the girls chest seized up in pain and her eyes filled with tears. She brought Margit closer to her and kissed the dolls cheek as if she were alive.	All of a sudden, the girl felt small and insignificant and curled up into a ball under the threadbare bedsheets. The memories of her family tortured her every night. Some nights, however, she would spend the cold hours reminiscing over happier times when the orphanage wasnt her home.	Other times, an all too vivid image of a car colliding with another flashed through her mind. She tried to focus on the joyful ones, but her mind was wild and untamed. It was the luck of a draw whether the memory remembered was a happy or sad one. Tonight, it was the girls lucky day.	A happy memory in particular stuck out. This memory was like a page in a book that had been read and dog-eared too many times to count. She didnt mind browsing through the same page and neither did the book.	She closed her eyes, not to sleep but to imagine and feel the rays of sunshine bearing down on her exposed back. She was instantly transported to a sunny day at the beach. It was midafternoon and her parents waved to her and her younger brother, who were building a sandcastle together down by the shore.	It wasnt how much of a castle it looked like thats important but, rather, the process. The process would forever be imprinted in memory, binding hearts and souls together.	A single tear fell from the girls left eye. It tickled her cheek as it slowly slid down her face. Soon enough, it noiselessly made contact with the sheets.	A tear was not a sign of weakness, though that cliche had infested many minds. Tears were a language from the heart you used when words lacked the comfort needed to soothe.	Another tear fell. It was hard to stop when the thrill of speaking fluently was so great. But the brave little girl put a cork on her crying. It would only make her more tired and that would not do. She must wait for him. She promised she would.	A light breeze coming from a window in the girls dormitory disturbed the curtains, causing them to billow in and out in a haunting ghost-like manner.	The fresh ocean air ventilated into the stuffy room. It wasnt necessary for the girl (or anyone else in the room) to strain their ears to hear the powerful waves crashing onto the shore, especially at this peaceful yet suspenseful hour.	She was restless and longed to venture outside but knew she must wait until he came. It was hard for her to wait and she had never been the patient type.	Another weak breeze blew into the room through the open window and then thats when she heard it: the dull ringing of the grandfather clock.	Halfway through counting the clocks methodic rings, she was certain she heard the window scrape softly along its partly rusted hinges. In immediate fear she buried herself under the threadbare sheets.	Her little heart raced a million beats per minute as her palms began to grow clammy. She strained her ears to listen for the signal. The heat under the sheets was stifling.	One, two, three soft taps on the window. A sigh of relief escaped her lips as she threw the sheets off and leapt out of bed with the grace of a cat. Her trusty companion, Margit, was naturally by her side.	Its me, a voice whispered, breaking the dutiful ticking of the clock. It was very dark and the girl couldn't see anything, but the creak of the wooden floor and the mysterious yet familiar voice told her she was not alone.	I know, she murmured back, blindly reaching for her tattered slippers in the dark. At last she found them tucked under her bed and slid them on. She edged toward the open window where she found a dark human looking figure precariously sitting on top of the sill.	You should come inside. I dont want you to catch a cold.	Ill be fine.	The girl nodded. The figure at the window watched her every move like a hawk and nothing escaped his notice. She moved closer over to the strange figure on her thin yet strong legs and reached out to him with one of her hands.	Hello, she began, latching onto the strangers hand. The stranger didnt bother to resist the girls hold.	Salutations, he said stiffly. He tried being kind, but being kind was never his forte.	Salutations, indeed.	It sounded foreign in her mouth, but she was delighted by the way her lips moved to form the word. There was silence on both ends, but it wasnt awkward at all. They preferred to think of it as companionable silence.	Why do you like me? the stranger suddenly blurted out. Why waste your precious hours of sleep. . . on me?	Without a seconds pause she replied without hesitation. Because I like your company. You make me happy.	He sighed quietly and looked past the girl into the room full of slumbering angels. She was too naive and young and pure to understand. I am a monster, but you already know that.	I know. But you dont look like a monster, she said innocently, toying with Margit.	Oh, let me tell you a secret young one. The really bad monsters never look like monsters.	The strangers rough voice cut the air like a dagger, immediately sending shivers down her back. Without saying a word more the figure slipped out of her grasp and off the window sill, vanishing into the moonless night.	Wait! she shouted, hoping he heard her desperate call. She strained her ears to listen for any sign of his return, but she heard nothing except the occasional sound of the haunting wind and the continuous crash of the ocean waves.	The girl pulled her doll close to her chest for comfort. Her heart ached with loneliness at the prospect that her friend had abandoned her without so much as a goodbye.	A few seconds later a large hand the size of a baseball mitt rested on the sill again. A grimy face with matted chestnut hair streaked with gray followed the hand. There was a wild yet calming look in his eyes as if he were coping with an internal storm.	Youre back, she stated simply. However, the look in her eyes was anything but simple. She was overjoyed he returned.	Yes. You called for me.	I did.	I cant stay for long.	I know, but why? Why do you leave me alone each and every night to the demons inside my head?	Oh, believe me when I say this. Id love to stay here with you all night if I could. I would, I really would. But I cant. I cant ignore it, no matter how hard I try to resist the urge.	But what is so much more important to you than me? The girl was so shocked at her impertinence that she covered her mouth with her hands. Im sorry, she whispered, clearly ashamed at her rudeness.	He pretended like he didnt hear the apology. He didnt want her to apologize because it was never her fault. It wasnt his either.	A date.	What?	A date is what keeps me from staying with you, he spat out bitterly. He said date as if it were something poisonous or toxic.	Like the fruit? she asked, now very confused. A fruit is more important than. . . than me? Her previous fury subsided to ash in an instance.	No, my dear! Not at all. You are more precious and dear to me than anything on this earth.	You think so?	He bowed his majestic head in a slow nod. I do.	She smiled and walked over to him. Then what did you mean when you said a date is more important than me? She cocked her head ever so slightly like a curious puppy would.	Its complicated, he said tiredly, even though it really wasnt.	Tell me. I can at least try to understand.	Of course you will. He smiled goodnaturedly and ruffled his hair. Well start off simple, then. You know how you receive traits from your parents, like eye color and height?	At the mention of parents, the girls eyes moistened. A tender stroke of the monsters hand on her blonde curls kept the dam from bursting. She gazed up into his eyes and whispered a soft yes.	Good. Well. . . He paused, a look of thoughtful concentration on his face. Well, I received a nasty trait. One that is very, very bad.	Oh.	Oh, indeed.	And so just because of that one trait, it makes you a monster?	Yes! Exactly.	But I dont see how thats possible. Isnt there a cure?	No, unfortunately there isnt. Not yet anyway.	What about this date you talked about? You didnt mention that.	The date, right. Well, without that date my inner monster would never be unleashed.	Easy! We just need to get rid of this date.	He let out a laugh similar to a bark. It didnt last long but it was enough to make the girl smile, slightly thawing the cold night. The stranger returned to his former serious tone. Ah, if only it were that easy.	He looked away from her for the first time during their conversation and into the pitch black night. The clouds were now a faint grey, no longer as black as coals. The moon was somewhere behind them, itching to free itself from its prison.	I should go  right now. Fear pulsed through each word, chilling the girls blood. She had never seen her friend this uptight or nervous.	Let me come with you.	No, he said firmly. A little girl like you should never see what I, a monster, am capable of.	I dont want you to be alone. I know what it feels like, she insisted.	Ive been alone all these years, and Im still here. I think I can survive on my own a bit longer. He scowled and bared his teeth, gnashing them together angrily like a wolf.	Now it was his turn to cover his mouth with his hands. No, no! I didnt mean it like that. I promise!	The girl backed away from him in total fear. In the process, she dropped her doll. The monster picked it up and reached it out to its owner.	Ella, he pleaded. Please. I wont hurt you.	She opened her mouth, then closed it. Nothing came out. O-o-ok, she stuttered at last. I trust you.	Good, good. But you must listen to what I have to say very carefully. My time is running out.	She nodded as she slowly walked across the length of the room toward the monster. Im listening. She retrieved the doll from his large hands and let it dangle by her legs.	You must not, by any means, follow me. And you cant ask me any questions. Do you understand?	The girl responded with a firm,I do. Ella was never a mischief maker or rulebreaker. It was why many of the orphaned girls believed she would get adopted any day now. Her chances of adoption were high anyway, what with her young age.	Wait!	He raised an eyebrow and then winced in pain, massaging his temple. What is it? The action went unnoticed by the girl.	I never got your name.	Hmm. Call me Moony.	Ok. . . Moony.	Goodbye, little one. Until next time.	Same time tomorrow?	I think you already know the answer to that. He winked.	Yes, I do.	But before I go, take this. Moony handed her a rectangular object covered in foil from a pocket in his shabby and patched coat. Here.	What is it?	Chocolate. My father loved the stuff.	Loved? What happened to your father?	Im not sure. I was told he fought bravely in battle; never made it out.	And your mother?	Same reason.	Oh. Im sorry, but I understand. Youre not alone, Moony. You never will be.	With a mischievous smile and sharp nod of his head, Moony vanished into the cloudy night. Well, it wasnt so cloudy and dark anymore. The moon was obviously getting restless from its time in cloud prison. The same with the stars.	The girl and her doll creeped back into bed, satisfied with the visit from her nightly visitor. As she snuggled under the covers, she whispered the name of her friend over and over to herself. She loved the way it rolled off her tongue.	A sigh of contentment escaped from her lips as she turned over in bed. Ella shut her eyes and, this time, for the promise of sleep. Maybe if she was lucky again she would relive a couple happy memories with her family.	Cuddling up with Margit, the only family she had left, she followed the scent of sugar plum fairies to meet and chase her wildest dreams. 	*** 	Early morning light shines in through the girls dormitory and everyone is still in bed, fast asleep. Well, everyone except for a little girl with green eyes and blonde hair who is hunched over her bed, staring at something in her lap.	In her hands is a battered and empty leather notebook. Beside her is a beautiful fountain pen that looks too magnificent to be seen or used in an orphanage. The girl opens the notebook and smells the rich creamy pages. A few words are scrawled in black ink at the top of the first page. It reads: 	 	Thats it. Its left unsigned, but the girl has a feeling she knows who wrote those words. She takes a shaky breath and picks up the fountain pen. Ella taps the pen on the notebook paper and bites her lip, unsure of what to write. After more than a few minutes a burst of inspiration breaks through, she finally begins like this:	It was a night like any other and, unfortunately, the loud activity of the night made it quite difficult to catch onto a dream and drift off to sleep. . ."
Life-sight,"This man, who's my father, is in hospital, even though Ive never seen him before. He looks exhausted and ill, nothing like how he used to be. When did it all start? He doesnt stay awake long when I come to visit. I dont think he likes me seeing him like this. He says you shouldnt be coming here to see me all the time. Ill be fine by next week, just watch, even though he never is. I wish other people would come. It would really take the pressure off. I wouldnt have to come every day. Hed be heartbroken if I didnt show up one day. He wouldnt say anything though. Now Im in a chair and Im talking to someone. Hes asking me personal questions that I dont really want to answer. He looks concerned, as if my face is slowly melting. Im telling him about memories that I cant remember happening, with people I dont recognise. He keeps writing stuff down, making these things I dont want to remember a material thing that I dont want to exist. I want to take it from him, but I know I cant. I dont even like this man and he certainly doesnt care about me. But maybe he can help me, I havent been going here for long, so its hard to see a difference. Now Im home, although I dont remember the journey here. My food is cold and theres a kid tugging at my sleeve. Its her bedtime, but I want to finish my food before putting her to sleep, but then I cant eat in peace. I have to let my food get colder and wait for her to fall asleep. Her dad is watching the tv. Im not sure if he notices that Im here. I go to bed early, dreading something but Im not sure what. Then I wake up. I always wake up with a racing heart even though its just the same nightmare. Just a nightmare of someone elses life. They change a bit every day, but its mostly the same. I thought Id be used to them by now. I want to believe shes not a real person, but everything seems too real for it to be fake. I wonder who she is. Poor girl. You were talking in your sleep again last night. Well, what do you want me to do about it?I dont know. Im just saying. You were groaning a lot.Im sorry if I woke you.Its fine. Its funny sometimes. The stuff you say. Same dream?Yep. Every night, Jay. Every. Night.Go see like a therapist about it. Maybe you have some unknown trauma.I cant afford a therapist. And what if send me to a mental hospital. The woman who dreams of a shittier version of her own life, thinks shes seeing through someone elses eyes. Doesnt sound too great does it?Maybe not.I gotta catch the bus. Ill see you later.Bye. The office is busy again as usual. Theres a big meeting today so all the important people are stressing over it. Its kinda nice in a way being non-important. I dont have to worry about that stuff. But then the extra money would be nice. I could get a car, and go abroad. Maybe I wouldve gotten that promotion if Sara hadnt. I swear it was between me and her. I cant blame them for choosing her over me though. She works a lot harder than I do, which isnt particularly hard I suppose. Well, people like her more anyway. Shes walking over here now, looking so important. I bet she bought that coffee just for the look. You cant go into a meeting without carrying something, Ive noticed that. It seems most people choose coffee. Hi, Chelsea.Hi.And then of course she trips and spills coffee all over me.Oh my God. Im so so sorry. Oh my God.Why would you do that! Whats wrong with youIm sorry. Ill go get some tissue.Whats tissue going to do?But she walks away anyway. I dont have a spare top, so Im going to have to sit with this damp stain on me all day. I cant afford to buy another top for no reason. Will they make me? Maybe theyll be too distracted by their meeting. I see Sara coming back with a handful of tissues.Here.Thanks.I dab at the stain but it obviously isnt doing much.Im really sorry.Theyre going to make me buy a new one.Im sorry. I can go grab one quickly?You have that meeting. Ill have to go now before someone sees me.They might not notice it.But I grab my stuff and leave anyway. I wonder wheres the cheapest place I can get a new blouse from. Maybe a charity shop will sell one, hopefully, one without a stain. What a shit day. Hes not talking to me much tonight. I think hes really tired. Ive barely said anything over the past hour, but I couldnt leave any earlier. I have to stay here at least an hour every night. I have to. Imagine being alone all day by yourself, except one hour where youre both too tired to even talk. I tell him Im leaving and all he does is nod. I think hes already falling asleep. A nurse talks to me explaining what theyre going to do next. I hope it works. I want him back. Now Im walking into a familiar looking office. Ive been here before. I know this place. Everyones wishing me good luck, but Im not sure why. I walk around until I spill a cup of coffee on someone. Which is me. Its not really nice seeing you act like that from someone elses view. I run into the bathroom and wipe away some tears, and come back acting completely fine. Im talking to the same man again. I told him about spilling coffee on a coworker and about my father in the hospital. He has that same concerned look on his face. He doesnt really say a lot. I do most of the talking and he does most of the nodding. How long before he starts being useful? I cant keep coming here. Its too exhausting. When I get home I realised that I forgot to prepare food, so I start doing that. My husband doesnt ask me how my day was. I thought he would considering I had that meeting. My daughter is actually in bed for once. I dont go up to check in case I wake her. I sit and watch TV in silence. My husband falls asleep on the sofa before coming up to bed, so I sleep alone. I wake up, feeling more dreadful than usual. I never realised I was dreaming Saras life. I guess I just hoped Id never see myself in these dreams. I mean, it couldve been anyone. I bet she really hates me after yesterday. Or maybe I just blur into all the other chaos thats going on in her life. I made her cry. I found out who I was dreaming about.Really? How?I saw myself in her dream. Its someone I work with.Oh really? Thats weird.Its all weird.Are you going to tell her?No. Id sound like a stalker more than anything.Yeah...So, youre just going to deal with them then?I think I have to.I think its cool in a way. How many people get to see someone elses actual life?Its awful. Its like having to cope with two different lives. Im actually worried over her father in the hospital, Jay.Honestly, I have no idea what to tell you.I know. I gotta go.See you. The bus is busy today. I dont really mind because Im distracted. I dont know why I thought these dreams would stop after I figured out who it was. This just makes it worse. I always sort of knew it was a real person, but now its actually true. And just that its Sara. Someone I know. Someone I dont really like. How can I ever look at her the same way again? I go into the office and carry on as usual. Ive brought a spare top with me today, and I think I will from now on as well. I mean its pathetic really, getting so angry over some spilt coffee. I see Sara walk in. She never talks to me, but Im still surprised when she doesnt come over to say anything. I forget that she doesnt know that Im a part of her life. Well, I feel like I am anyway. I keep staring at her. She eventually looks over and smiles. Ive never liked this woman really, but all I can do is smile back. Out of all the things thats going to happen to her today, I hope maybe this one thing will cheer her up."
Different,"It all started normal. Every day of every week, the same. Month after month, year after year. The same. It happened fast. The day the rhythm stopped, and his life was changed forever.He was walking. His mind clouded with the events of the day. All the same. He checked his watch. It was the same watch he had bought ten years ago. The day he got the job. An ordinary job. Lots of papers, lots of work. Never changing. The job paid well, just enough to pay the bills and feed him. He didnt own a car. He didnt need one. He walked everywhere, every day. To work, to home, to the grocers down the street. There was no stop. He couldnt stop. He knew he would get home eventually, he just had to keep going.His favorite part of the day was walking past the park. The birds, chirping a tune to the sky. The trees, swaying like dancers on a stage. And the children, running and yelling and playing. But something was wrong, something was different. He stopped, nothing was different.The ground was shaking, dust rising off the ground. The birds took flight, their song no longer beautiful. The trees were shaking, their leaves falling from their strong branches. And the children were screaming.The ground cracked as the machine rose from the earth. The hand of a corpse, rising from its grave. The man yelled and dove behind a bench, shielding himself. A sounded from below him as a gas pipe exploded. Heat washed over him and smoke burned his eyes. His ears were ringing. Something was falling, and he looked up. A giant slide was tipping over, right towards him. He yelled as it crashed on top of him, stopping him from moving. He was stuck, and he could feel his wrist break.In front of him, the dust cleared and he could see the park, his escape, right in front of him. Sitting there, its engine giving off and electric hum, was the machine. The man stared at it. A large drill was attached to its front, meant for tearing through the ground. It reminded the man of the monsters and beasts he would read about when he was small. The always scarred him, but nothing compared to the fear he was feeling now. He thought.Something was flying through the sky above him. No- not something -He thought. He stared at her as she glided through the air. He frowned.She landed on top of the beast-like machine. Wings protruded out of her shoulders, stretching into the sky. Blue eyes stared down at the beast, scanning it. Her hair red hair flowed down her back like a river.The man thought. The red hair woman laid a hand down on the machine. For a few seconds, everything was quiet. Even the trees seemed to be holding their breath. The man watched in awe as the metal beneath the womans hands seemed to melt away. After a couple minutes, the whole roof had been disintegrated to no more than a heap of red-hot steel.The red hair woman wiped her hands on her pants and jumped down through the whole, into the beast. The man heard the sounds of a fight coming from the machine. He could hear the yells of pain as bullets tore through skin, as bones were broken. The man closed his eyes. How he wished for his simple life now. He would be home by now, if his life were the same. Preparing for tomorrow, the same, never changing. Instead, he was trapped under a slide hoping that the fight down below never came up to the surface.The man heard the noises stop. His mind whisperedThe beast lurched as the woman soared out of it, her red hair trailing behind her. She looked around, scanning the park with her bright blue eyes. The man was frozen in place. His mind was racing, sprinting through all the things that could happen to him. He couldnt stand to think about what the red-haired woman could do to him.She seemed to find what she was looking for. Her eyes locked onto it. She started walking towards it. Her pace quickened with every step. The man could see the flame in her eyes. The worst thing was, the thing she was looking for, was him.Are you alright? She asked him, reaching for his hand.Yes. He said, grabbing it. He was in shock after watching the woman melt the slide above him, only to ask if he was okay. Her hand burned. He could feel blisters sprouting over his skin.Sorry. She said, blushing. He said nothing. He tried to say thanks but what just happened? came out instead. She laughed. It was a pretty laugh, unique. Without answering, she beat her wings and took off into the sky. The man watched her fly off until she was no more than a speck in the sky.It took the rest of the night for the event to sink in. The man had saw a and a andIt felt like a dream.Something must have hit him in the head, because the next day, he quit his job. He took a different root home from work, too. And a week later, he adopted a child. They went to the park every day. The mans story is short, for he was no more than a prop in something bigger than himself. But it meant all the same to him. Something changed in the man that day. He could have died. He decided he was going to live his life to the fullest, and be what he could never be before."
Dust Covered Girl,"Allow me to tell you a story. A sad story, true, one that you think you know. It is short, and simple, and easy to remember, but you do not know the true tale. Nonetheless, I shall share it with you now: Shed always been a special kind of girl, that one - not that she ever noticed. She used to go through the house, humming to herself as she swept, content in her own world, never realizing that there were those who plotted against her behind closed doors.She had been born there, her father a noble, her mother a beauty. Her childhood had been one from a fairy tale, until her thirteenth birthday. We had grieved alongside her when her mother passed, and felt her anguish when her father brought home a new wife a few years later. Wed thought, perhaps the same as he, that her new step sisters would love her as much as everyone else who met her.I am ashamed to say they did not. It did not take long for the girl to find comfort in other things better than sisters - books, for example. She would while away the hours hidden in her paper worlds, curled in the corner of her fathers study. Even after he passed she would find safety there, as the dust piles grew and the lights faded.While her step family spent their time wrapped in silks and smoke from their extravagant parties, the house fell into disrepair. Her stepmother sent the staff away, and left the chores to the girl. She dressed herself in rags and ash and cleaned.Eventually, people forgot there had ever been another girl in the house when they looked at the glittering step-sisters, the jewels of their mothers eye. But the girl herself did not forget. How could she, when the dust covered paintings stared down at her on the floor of the kitchen while she slept? How could she, when the trills of their laughter echoed down the bare halls while she scrubbed the stairs? How could she, when the scars from their beatings rippled across her skin while she scrubbed herself clean with the leftover water.As she grew older, their treatment of their step-sister/-daughter grew unsurprisingly even more cruel. Quiet words turned into forceful shoves. Forceful shoves turned into lashings. And so on. The girl ignored it all, forcing her anger deep down, putting on a brave face.The years went by, as they tend to do. The girl grew prettier, not that you could tell under the thin layer of dirt on her skin. Her step-family grew more despicable. One summer night, the letter came from court. Im sure, dear reader, you already know what this letter contained, but for the sake of this sad tale, let me continue.It was an invitation to the ball, three weeks hence. Naturally, the step-mother was delighted for an opportunity to show her ghastly daughters off. She found their finest dresses, and demanded the girl spend the next three weeks cleaning and mending them for her daughters. The girl gladly accepted this task, her fingers tired of washing dishes and beating the carpets.The first week, she worked on the eldest daughter's dress. A horrid green number, it had spent many years in the back of a closet and was covered in webs and all manner of bugs. It also needed to be taken out, as it had been a long time since it had been worn, and the eldest daughter had taken a liking to the sweet fudge served after dinners.I watched the girl wash the dress in the tub, swirling the water gently over the pretty designs in the lace. She unpicked the sides of the dress, adding in a black swath of fabric either side in order for it to fit on the sister. She lowered the hem, and added a simple golden trim to the edge. The step sister fell in love with it as soon as she saw it.The second week, the girl spent with the youngest daughter, and her nightmare of a gown. All I should have to say about it was that it was yellow with blue thread. The girl washed it, took it in for her step-sister (her diet was as sour as her disposition), and added a few diamantes to the sleeves to make it sparkle. I can tell you, while I dont have a gag reflex, the sight of that dress made me wish I did.The third week was for her step-mothers dress. A simple silk number, even I have to agree it was very becoming. It did not need a lot of work, only a simple wash and press, but the girl made sure every inch of it was perfect. I watched her go over it all myself.The night before the ball, the house was full of a feeling I had not felt in a long time - excitement. The girls stepmother and stepsisters were in the sitting room, eager for the next day to begin, while the girl was washing up from dinner. Her step family had feasted on roast chicken and potatoes. The girl had cold peas and ham. I heard them call her up, and saw the look of fear on her face. I felt her dread as she passed me and crept up the stairs, her slippered feet dragged slowly upwards.I did not follow, but I did not need to. I hear the yelling, the demands, from my cubby in the kitchen well enough. I heard the china smash on the floor, the sobbing of the girl as she fled, the cruel laughter of the step-sisters chasing her out of the door. Im sure I dont need to go into details.She left the house as the light faded. I followed her as far as the edge of the garden, but she disappeared into the forest without looking back. I worried for her, pacing up and down the kitchen for what felt like hours before I heard the door open.Her face pale, dried tear tracks cutting through the ash on her face, she crossed the kitchen and silently made her way to the parlour, where the three dresses were waiting to be put on for the ball. Here is what she did:To the eldest step-sisters dress, she took a handful of poison ivy and sewed it inside the dress, around the bodice and beneath the crinoline.To the youngest step-sisters dress, she sewed feathers through the fabric at just the right angle to poke at her legs and arms constantly. She added a touch of fish scales inside the hemline.For the step-mother, I watched as she took a pair of scissors and made several cuts - I could not tell you exactly where - so that the dress would, at the right moment, with enough stress, fall to pieces and expose her step-mother to the world.She scooped up ash from the fireplace and mixed it in with their powder, and dripped candle wax over their shoes.Finally, the girl went down to the kitchen and curled up in front of the fire. For the first time in years, she slept with a smile on her face.The next evening, her stepmother and stepsisters left for the ball without suspecting a thing. Sure, the girls were itchy and uncomfortable as they left, and all three looked a little grey in the face, but I thought they looked very nice - for now.I watched from an upstairs window as they left in the carriage, and turned to see the girl dancing alone in the garden, truly alone for the first time in her life. I am sorry to say it lasted only mere hours.They were back before midnight, the carriage screaming down the road. I could hear their anger from my windowsill perch, and ran off to warn the girl, but she already knew. The triumphant fear on her face as her stepmother bore down on her was a sight Ill never forget. My brave girl. Stupid, brave girl.I wish I could have protected her, but you know how these things go. They walked, the four of them, out through the garden, her stepsisters holding her tight by the arms, and melted into the forest. I sat with bated breath all night, waiting for them to return. When they did, the morning sunlight barely kissing the tops of the trees, it was without the girl. Years passed. The youngest daughter took on the chores left by the girl, and when she ran away, the eldest daughter did so too. The stepmother became a sad, lonely woman, alone in her home, until eventually, she left this world completely.I will say, just to you, dear reader, that before she died, the stepmother was visited by a mysterious woman. No one knew much about her, other than years previously, she had stolen the heart of a prince, and had enjoyed many years of happy marriage with him. Her resemblance to my girl of old was uncanny, but naturally, a coincidence.I do not know what she said to the old woman, for I too am old and cannot hear as well as I once did, but I know it was only a few days after that I was truly alone in that house. Not all stories have a happy ending, dear reader, but perhaps we can say that maybe this one did. But what do I know? I wouldnt blame you for listening to an old mouse ramble, but one must pass the time somehow, and this was a tale that needed to be told."
Eye Understand,"I am Issac . I live in in this old but gorgeous town in Egypt. I have been living here since 10 years . Well my live has drastically changed in the past one year .

Beatrice from Downey Street,"The gloomy drizzle that kept her neighbors tucked inside, sniffling by their fireplaces, was the same gloomy drizzle that put Beatrice in the mood for a long walk.Approaching her closet like an old friend, she carefully plucked out a sweater that would do nicely for the occasion.It was an exceptionally chunky sweater with a high neckline cut like a tea cozy. She shrugged it on and slipped into a faded pair of gingham pants that looked just like the pants she wore yesterday.Holding on tightly to the frilly cuffs of her sweater, she squeezed her arms into the stiff sleeves of her orange raincoat until her hands shot out the other sides.She tugged the drooping ankles of her socks upward and stepped into her rain boots. They were still a little wet from yesterday so they put up a fight.She topped it all off with a purple hat, the placement of which she adjusted in the mirror to a dashing arrangement that would also keep the rain from gathering in droplets on her bushy eyebrows.From her tiptoes, she reached into the closet and grasped for her favorite basket. It rested on the highest shelf above a row of neatly hung sweaters, coats, cardigans, and long-sleeves. Her second favorite basket was on the lower shelf, and easier to reach. But today was wet and mucky so she needed the special basket coated in a water-wicking serum of some sort.She stretched her arm out past where her eyes could see. Her hand patted around curiously in the dark, scoping left and right like the arm of a submarine. Nothing. Shed need to get a better look. And so she stepped over to her writing table and lifted her wooden chair from where it nestled peacefully into her desk. She placed it carefully below the curtain of color-coded sweaters and climbed until she was two feet above where she normally stood. Her rain boots squelched below her in anticipation.Ah, now she could see where the basket was hiding. It was tipped over on its side in the corner of the shelf just out of reach from where she was before she brilliantly thought of stepping onto the chair to get a better look.But how did it get over there?Questions immediately clamored into her head.Confusing thoughts took turns clearing their throats to say ahem, did you think of this?But she nudged them away with the image of herself happily trotting up and down her hilly neighborhood in the early mist and drizzle. In the vision, her charming french basket hung from her arm, overflowing with fresh basil, tomatoes still on the vine, and just cut pasta from Lucianas.A sharp gust from the window must have blown in and knocked it over, she reasoned.The skin around her dark, round eyes, creased into a smile. The confusion of a moment ago disappeared like candlelight, leaving only a subtle smokey fragrance behind to suggest that something was once burning.And good thing she had regained her composure because had she not, she surely would have toppled over at the shock of what she was about to see.Well, she would soon in fact topple over. But it would be for something else. And not just for the mere shock of it.She pushed her booted toes into the chair, clutched a burgundy cardigan for balance, and stretched for the basket handle. She gave it a tug, light but precise from muscle memory.But the handle slipped through her fingers and the basket, unwilling to budge, stayed put.Well, I must have left a few things in it the last time I used it, she reasoned.This was reasonable. It had been a while, at least 6 months. It would be reasonable to forget something from yesterday let alone 6 months ago.Starting to feel unsettled and beginning to question if she actually could remember what happened yesterday, Beatrice again brought to mind her walk and her basket that would soon be full of ingredients for dinner.Maybe she would also stop by the pharmacy and pick up another tube of her favorite strawberry lip balm. She liked the creamy way it glided on and the waxy film it left behind.Yes, these thoughts helped.At this point, she had been standing on her chair for over a minute and realized she had better hurry. She didnt know just how sturdy this chair was or for how long the sky intended to drizzle.So she reached for the handle one last time and gripped it firmly. She gave it a bold yank but nothing that could tear a muscle. It was still just a basket, and the heaviest item it could possibly be hiding was a coin purse.Except that ithiding something heavier than a coin purse.At last, the basket acquiesced, she pulled the handle down and toward herself so the bowl of the basket swiveled to face her and revealed, not a coin purse, but rather, a family of ruddy, pale white and tan, field mice.Beatrice was a little startled but not disgusted. The sight of four mice living in her closet was certainly a surprise but she mostly had questions. Questions such as these. How long had they been living there? What have they been eating? How did they get there?The mice were unwilling to disclose any information. Not because they were secretive but because Beatrice only thought these questions, she didnt say them out loud or address the mice directly.Beatrice is fond of animals. Which isnt very remarkable because many people make such a claim. But Beatrice truly loved animals. What other explanation could there be for her unexpected lack of reaction? She loved all of them. Big ones, hairy ones, somewhat smelly ones, tiny ones, slimy ones that lurked in caves, ones with many eyes or only a few. She liked bugs and insects and knew the difference between the two. To the disgruntlement of her mother, she often left all the windows in the house open to let in the fresh breeze along with anything or anyone who flew in with it.Turning over rocks to see what lived underneath gave her a thrill. But she only allowed herself the treat on rare occasions when curiosity got the best of her. Unless invited, its rude to lift the roof off of someones house.So this is why when she discovered the mice, she didnt squeal or squawk. Her first thought was not, how do I get rid of them. The word vermin never even crossed her mind. She simply had questions. Questions she could never get the answers to because, as we clarified earlier, she didnt say them out loud.The mice, on the other paw, did not know Beatrice's intentions.The mother mouse realized, quite astutely, that her family may be in danger. Her devoted children smelled their mothers terror and the beating of their small hearts quickened and drummed deafeningly in their furry little ears. And so they all lay impossibly still. A defense mechanism that came to them as naturally as breathing. If you simply dont move, youll blend in with your surroundings and the predator will carry on. Its brilliant. Only, these mice were not made of willow twigs like the basket. They were regular field mice and they stood out perfectly clear before Beatrice.And so this is what Beatrice saw.Four small field mice. One of which was about the same size you would imagine a mouse might be followed by three smaller mice with large, lovable eyes and clean whiskers.All of them were frozen in time in various poses. The first, unblinking with one back paw in the air, the second hunched over in mid-sniff, the third on its hind legs with its rump up against the snout of the second, and the fourth in a precarious position that it could only hold for a few more moments before it would betray them all.The fourth mouse tried its best to maintain balance in the unlucky position it found itself in. But after an applauded effort to remain still (Beatrice applauded in her mind), the plucky mouse lost its holding and tumbled into the third mouse which tipped over and struck the second in the ear who flopped onto its side and rolled over the edge in slow motion into Beatrices small, waiting hands.A scuttle ensued.The mother mouse squeaked and then lurched from her haunches to sink her claws into Beatrices chest.Beatrice then squeaked too and fell backward from her chair.She landed, her bottom bearing the brunt of the fall, onto her plush rug. The landing making a dull sound like this: Beatrice blinked away the stars from her eyes and looked down into her lap. Between her crossed legs sat the mother mouse and a smaller mouse. Each staring up at her with sparkling black eyes.She looked at them warmly and they looked at her with facial expressions that no human could discern emotion from. Not even Beatrice. But she could see the rapid drumming of their little hearts lifting and lowering the glittering fur on their chests. She thought it best to calm them through conversation.She asked them more questions such as: Would you like to go on a walk? and, How will you all fare out in the drizzle? as well as, Will you be cold?The two mice had no idea what the sounds coming from her face meant. But to their befuddlement, they could tell by her tone and demeanor that she wasnt a threat.With everyone now relaxed, Beatrice gently placed the two mice back in the basket with the others, and the five of them went out for a stroll. ...... Beatrices house was the third red door on Downey street somewhat across from The Cathedral of the Whispering Lady. Just a few bricks to the north and it would have been exactly across. But any matter, Beatrice liked being somewhat across from The Cathedral.Every Sunday morning, a chorus of nuns from The Cathedral sang morose lullabies to a sleepy crowd of 15 or 20. Their songs swam on the breeze that blew in through her bay windows. Their rich oos, throaty ahhs, and reverent ahlalas stirred sweetly into her morning cup of coffee.On this particular Sunday morning, the youngest nun in the choir, sister Izzy, prepared her lungs for her favorite song in their repertoire:. She parted her chapped lips and filled her body with oxygen.But the air on this day was uncommonly humid and creamy.Not soupy, but.As she inhaled, her lungs filled with sweet, rich air and she belted forth a note never before heard by humans and hardly understood by the ones around her. The choir pianist would later claim that it was like hearing the great pearly gates of heaven opening to receive him.At the precise moment that sister Izzy sang the most other-worldly note ever surrendered from the human body, Beatrice with her basket full of mice, stepped from her red door on Downey Street. The note swam out of Izzy, reverberated through The Cathedral halls, burst out of the grand entrance doors, bounced off of Beatrice's closed window, flew back to the chimney of The Cathedral where it gathered steam and swooped downward, knocked over the cap of a nearby garden gnome, and finally swept under the heels of Beatrices feet just as she was stepping from her doorstep.The tone carried her 8 inches above the ground for about 15 steps until she glided back onto the pavement.But Beatrice didnt notice. Humans never notice such things. But the mice watched with stunned expressions from their respective perches in Beatrices basket.Years later, the smallest mouse would tell the story of what happened that day to her babies. And those little mice would go on to tell their babies, and so on and so forth until the story became so grand and impossible that 300 years from now, every mouse throughout the country would know a story that was similar in rhythm but nowhere near the truth.Depending on who told the story, Beatrice transformed into anything from a stork named Guffrey to a rocketship named, and the note carried on the breeze could be anything from the blast of a grenade to a 20 mile swim across one of the great lakes. ...... Beatrice's home sat on a street that wound its way up a large hill. If you went down the hill youd find flat sidewalks and eventually another hill. But if you walked to the very top youd find a forest. And once you got to the top of the forest, your view would show you all that laid below. Which seemed like everything.It was a small forest. But it was slowly expanding and sprawling its way around Conical Hill, a hill that seemed more like a mountain from the bottom and which sat nearly in the very center of town. It was speckled with houses that crawled up the winding streets in a circling manner and got fancier the higher up the hill they were.The houses nearest the top were luxurious and resplendent with shiny things and very intentional gardens that looked both whimsical and orderly in a way that suggested someone who knew a lot about gardening was procuring all of their gardens. Like perhaps a gardener.They were lovely houses, but the forest was continuously making attempts to take back the hill and it frustrated the people who lived there. They knew it was just a matter of time before the forest overwhelmed them or they left this house and the vines and grasses moved in. But must it be right this very second?At the very top of the hill, far above the houses and people, an eagle sat perched on a weathered branch of an old eucalyptus. Its brilliant feathers were tipped in gold and finely threaded with shimmering crimson. From its seat high on the hill, the eagle surveyed what lay below with piercing mud-colored eyes. The irises of which were tipped in the same gold as its feathers.The eagle had an unobstructed view of Beatrice as she swayed down the hill with her basket brimming with mice.When the eagle spotted Beatrice it immediately recognized her as interesting. The eagle was well aware that delicious things like picnic spreads, groceries, and rustic breads usually rested inside finely woven baskets.Its common knowledge in the eagle community.With its finely tuned eyes expertly designed to spot the merest of faraway details, the eagle next noticed rustling in the basket.It immediately left its perch and took flight towards her.For the briefest of moments, as the eagle spread its wings, the trees stiffened up and the sun shone through a break in the clouds. The eagles' brilliant golden feathers caught the light of the sun and reflected it into Beatrices left eye.Beatrice blinked. Beatrice walked and rummaged through her thoughts while five rather excited mice stood in her basket attentively scoping out the world under the protection of her and her basket.Three of the mice stood on their haunches. The mother stood the tallest and used her height to raise the hood of the basket. This created a discreet crack for her and two of the medium-sized mice to peer out of. The two smallest mice made-do peeking through a small hole in the bottom of the basket. They could just make out Beatrice's left, and then right foot marching down below. The hole was situated right where a little nob used to be. There also used to be a piece of twine attached to the hood that Beatrice wrapped around the nob to keep the hood of the basket secure. But the mice had chewed them both off days ago.As she continued her walk to the street with the stores and shops, Beatrice thought about how she might fit the ingredients for dinner into her basket alongside the mice. If she bought a wedge of cheese, would the mice eat it all or save some for her? Would they trample on the basil or would the herbs strong scent keep them away?Yes, probably, she decided. Mice dont like basil. Or at least they dont prefer it.And so she would get a hard cheese like parmesan instead of something soft.Mice probably didnt like parmesan.But while the mice in Beatrice's basket cant speak for all mice, they were confident that they did in fact like parmesan. Cheese in general was a great favorite of theirs along with delicacies like popcorn and strawberry greens. And while it was true that they didnt prefer basil, they would happily trample all over it if given the opportunity.One of the smaller mice was even doing a little trampling at this very moment. To get a better look, it stepped on the bewildered head of the smallest mouse and did a sort of dance to maintain its balance.The soft sounds of something being squished lifted Beatrices head from her thoughts. She looked into the basket for the source of the commotion to find one little mouse squeaking for air and another pretending not to notice it was standing on someones sternum.Beatrice separated the two, shushed them, and strode into the shop overly confident to compensate for her basket full of secrets."
"The moon, pills and other wrong things","Theres nothing much like being woken up in a body that is most definitely not your own.The familiar feeling of bedding youve never touched. A dress a might bit overfitted for sleeping.The swift timbre of a voice you only remember from your dreams.The blur of eyes that are not your own.It mightve been a blessing to be nearly blind, if Lily hadnt wanted to understand.It was still nothing to let go, when her body pulled her back.Whoever she was when she dreamed at night, was beautiful.But Lily knew full well what dreams were made of. Lies and memories.Lily Prince was halfway up from her own bed, when she wrote it down, the nothing in a strangers head shed experienced halfway lucid in a dream all her own.So excited she was, from her dream, shed forgotten to look at the clock.2:15? When she finally looked over, the flurry and excitement of her journaling had waned into a wakeful calm. She decided to cut her losses and call it an early day.Making coffee, starting her car, going to work, going home.The little things that made a quiet life, flew by in the form of a robotic compliance to custom. There was little thought in her world, and while for others it felt mindless, her days werent often worth even that.But then there were the pills.And sleep.And really, it was the only reason she worked at this point. Selling her hours for her dreams. In a literal way that most would be at least a little apprehensive about.Especially considering the side effects.Lily didnt live in luxury, but this did nothing to distance her from the indulgence. Slipping one by with whatever she was drinking, itd been a split second when shed forgotten what night felt like, and lucid dreams held favor in her mind.Her stomach lurched, as she saw what shed hit.Please dont let it be a person. But it was.Its alright sweetheart, shell wake up later. went a soft voice beside her, from a side glance, Lily saw a bespeckled face.She didnt even feel sick. As her body pulled her back.Lily was very sure of where shed been when she fell into it. When her car hit something.But there she was, in her bed.Had Lily forgotten every last step between the road from work to her house? Was she really that far gone? Had her mind traumatized her just to force her back into her body?She walked outside to look at the sky. What had she expected to see?The world realigned, and she hid her pills. She didnt need to get lost again. And soon she was better, her experimentation with them had ended.It wasnt like she didnt know where they were. If she wanted them.Weeks went by, and the fog that she so enjoyed from the pills had left her. Shed expected a brighter world to reveal itself, for that fog to be a consequence of her less than healthy habit.But as her body kept functioning, moving away from that of a body under the influence of strange substances, she started to recognize the vacant nature of her life.Lily had taken to the notion that shed always known this, having been aware for much longer than she'd been willing to admit.One would think it sensible to obtain a hobby, or some other such nonsense, but so little of her life could be hers along with her other expenses.It didn't take long to find her answer. To find her pills.She dreamed as she wished that night, with little regard for her journal, or her work, they hadn't seen a difference. With the fog.Beauty had a name in the body she'd woken up in, scratched out in her mind though it was.She managed to find her glasses, something she knew the body needed.And she saw it.The other woman in the car.Lily hadn't known the face before, but she knew she'd been in here before.In the body of the woman in the mirror.If she'd known that all it would take to learn was a little time off her pills she would have - she didn't know what she would've done.She wouldnt have wasted the effort, she wouldve gotten impatient.It was better that she tried to get away.She felt the woman fall as her body pulled at her, Lily was back in her bed. Lily wanted to hold onto her dream, but it was a little much to write down with a late start.She went to work as always. It was early, and the fog of her drive was taking over.Lily saw a flash, in the blatant gray of morning, inch for inch, a repetition.But she was awake this time.Dont you remember? Shell wake up later! Pamela said to her, Lily knew her name without even looking fully.Pamela.Pamela was almost biblical with age, as a name at least, being invented in the 16th century by an over-posh Courtier. Though even as it became dated, it never quite lost its youthful associations.The bespeckled woman. In an overfitted dress. With an umbrella.She wanted to cuss, she wanted to scream, how could her mind do this to her again, I just ran somebody-Kani Pascal. Pamela interrupted.What?Kani Pascal. she repeated. As if to clarify.-Kani Pascal? Lily questioned back, the discussion going nowhere. I recognize the last name, but not.Pass over rabbit? Pamela said, leading.No.Yes.The easter bunny? her eyes glazed over, realizing belatedly that her subconscious wasnt worth looking at. Lily got out of her car to assess the damages, though being in her head, in her dream, precluded the action from being relevant.Arent you gonna look up?why?Dont you wanna see the sky of your dreams?She turned her head to see the starry sky, she was farther out than was altogether expected. Well, Ill be. Its just the moons, Pam."
The Monster's Mother,"My husband offended the gods. Thats what started this nightmare. I asked him not to. I warned him, , I warned him, . Youve heard the stories! I cried. How could you even consider something so stupid? Have you never heard a bedtime tale? I shouted myself hoarse but nobody cared.	On this island, I am counted second to mortal men, though my father is the sun itself. You would think that since they owe their lives and sustenance to my father, they would show me some measure of respect, but you would be wrong. You might also think that Helios would intervene on my behalf, but there youd be wrong again.	When I married, I passed from his domainthe Heavensto my husbands domaina tiny island off the coast of Eurasia. I learned early on that any modicum of respect or power must be clawed out with my fingernails. I didnt mind too much; I was good at it, so why waste time complaining?	Oh, I was bitter at first, but It was always unlikely that I would conquer the sky. Crete was a different story. For all that my husband took precedence, he is  from the immortals. I am an immortal. The power that beauty and magic can forge was a power I had in spades. I would never have been a queen of gods, but I was a queen of mortals, and all told, I did very well for myself.	I should clarify that my royal husband, renowned for his wisdom, did not scorn some minor deity, but Poseidon, Lord of the Seas. I knew retribution would be swift and terrible, and I feared for my children. In some measure, I feared for this country as well. I even feared for my husband, though it could be argued that he deserved whatever punishment came since he brought this on himself out of sheer stupidity.	I did not fear for myself. I had done nothing wrong. I did not belong to my husband, I was not born of my husbands blood, I was not under his protection. I owed him nothing, and I was foolish enough to think that would keep me safe.	It was pride if Im being honest, what the mortals call . The thing is, hubris is a fatal flaw in mortals because it equates them with the gods. I am a goddess myself. I am Deaths equal. The same ichor that runs gold through his veins flows through mine; fatality cannot touch me. Im not Hera or Aphrodite or Athena but I am a goddess in my own right, so surely Im entitled to my pride?	Apparently not. No, Im a disposable piece that can be used to inflict pain or joy as the Olympians see fit.	I will not be ashamed of what I did. I will not apologize. I did what I did out of love and in doing so I brought life. It was my husband who spilt human blood after he would not spill the blood of a bull. It was Theseusmay his soul die a thousand deaths in the Fields of Punishmentwho murdered and profaned and destroyed. It was my beautiful baby girl, my Ariadne, who betrayed me. It was Poseidon who orchestrated these events.	Something any fool (except evidently my husband) knows about our gods: theyre constantly pulling strings you cannot see.	The bull was always extraordinary. It was a charming boast of Poseidons, a gift from him that was to be sacrificed to him. The animals fur was whiter than sand, whiter than birch, whiter than the purest snow. His horns were high and magnificent. Every muscle was visible through that snowy hide, and there was a strength to him that took your breath away. All the majesty and magnetism of the natural world blended and perfect in one creature. All we had to do was kill it.	I will not pretend that my heart didnt twist in my chest at the thought, but I begged my husband to do it anyway. He is fond of saying he has the heart of a king. I am fond of saying I have the heart of a witch. Its what his people say too, sometimes, and I let them. (They may love or hate me so long as they understand me, understand what I am: not one of them.)	So what we learned from this incident, right at the outset, is that witches are stronger than kings. I put my pain aside but he could not. His selfishness was a slight to the Sea Lord, so of course the price was terrible. And, I might add, terribly unjust.	Do not think that I was unaware. I was denied that mercy. I knew precisely what was happening to me, but I didnt care. All I cared about was the bull himself, and that .	It was neither lust nor hunger nor adoration, but some monstrous combination of the three, and it was all-consuming. It ate my thoughts, my seconds and hours, my perceptions and all my dreams. As it consumed me, it became me, until I had long since lost track of where I ended and the craving began. I was all yearning, all desire. I was made of it, or it was made of me. There was no way to tell. I didnt mind. My life had funnelled down to a single, clear purpose: satisfy the craving.	I knew I would have to be clever, but then I  clever. We always were, my sister and I. I suppose you have to be clever if you wish to make a name for yourself even when no one wants to hear it.	My name comes from the word for light, that is used by my husbands people. Pasipha means wide-shining. Appropriate for the suns daughter. And I do shineI am stunningly beautiful. You can tell because when people tell stories about me they always take pains to emphasize my vanity.	I always find that amusing. Vanity implies an investment in the praise and admiration of others. I enjoy what worship my skill with magics and poisons have brought me, true. Still the idea that I would seek out admiration in people who live short, inelegant lives and then age themselves out of existence has always confused me.	Anyway, I understood that cleverness was necessary if I was to achieve what had become the sole purpose of my life. I knew I was under Poseidons influence, and I did not care. I enlisted the help of someone I knew would be too intrigued to refuse me and too intimidated to betray me.	Daedalus and I have something like a friendship. No, better than thata partnership, an understanding. We are both workers of extranormal craft here in my husbands court, which is otherwise overflowing with mediocre crafts and people. He uses his hands and his mind to create wonders, or to help men achieve them. I use my hands and my mind to work wonders over those around me.	Some gods might think it overreaching of him to aspire to elevate his invention to the level of godly privileges, like flying or changing form. Men certainly do, though they bite their words back in the face of his genius. He and I know the same thing, that everyone must make their own way in this world. Neither of us would trade our talents for the approbation of those who cannot understand them. I wonder whether they call him vain when they tell tales of .	Just as I anticipated, Daedalus was both appalled and eager to help.	Somehow, he was able to animate the cow. For all the world it seemed a living thing. When you looked into its empty eye sockets, you so expected to see the flame of life that your mind filled it in for you. It could have fooled anyone. Certainly it fooled my husband. It also fooled the bull, which was a more impressive feat.	I cannot describe to you what stepping into that contraption was like, what it did to me. There is something glorious in becoming what you are not. All I could think as I donned the cows body and went in search of that breathtaking beast Poseidon sent was that I finally understood what it would feel like to be Zeus. I thought, remembering Io and Leda and Callisto and all the others. The ecstasy of escaping myself and embodying anothers form was a sort of perfection Id never known to dream of. It was freedom, and it was bliss.	After all this time I still remember in blistering detail how that pure, clean whiteness in his fur drank the moonlight so that he seemed to glow. The bull was loveliness incarnate, ethereal and untouchable, so clearly not of this world. The sight of him made my heart beat so loudly that I could hear nothing over the rush of ichor in my ears. The sensation of him inside me, inside that animal body that was at once unfamiliar and somehow my own, was better than anything else I ever felt.	You probably think that once Poseidon had had his joke and released me from his influence, I would feel revulsion. But I felt neither revulsion nor remorse.	I knew at once that I was pregnant; deities do. It was with a sharp, expectant joy that I watched my stomach begin to swell. I felt the babys vitality and strength, even then. I anticipated the birth of a child I had created in the sheer, triumphant pleasure of being alive.	When I brought him into this world, there was pain unlike anything Id known or even imagined could be possible. I reveled in it. It was real, clean pain. It made me feel human. Not disgustingly so, but achingly so, like the weight of experience and creation was tearing me to shreds. I loved it. I loved him too.	My midwife and idiot handmaidens were horrified. One of them actually . I knew it was nonsense. He was strange and beautiful. He teemed with life, just as he had in the womb. His horns were purest white like his fathers fur, and his chest was taut with powerful muscle. He had eyes as deep and dark as Hades. They glittered with cunning, animalistic intelligence.	I had my husband Minos stupidity to thank for this miracle, so I did him the undeserved honor of naming the child Minotaur. It signifies the bull of Minos, to represent his dual naturehuman and animal.	Of course everyone treated my son as though he were some demon loosed from Tartarus to torment them. I didnt care. He had me, and I intended to see to it that he wouldnt need anyone else. We spent every moment together. I knew it made his siblings jealous, but I did it anyway. Perhaps I loved him more and perhaps that was wrong, but if I did it was because he needed it more. From his first breath he was rejected and reviled. I didnt want him to grow up believing that reflected on who he was or who he had to be; I wanted him to know he had choices. He was deserving of love, deserving of anything.	I nursed him until he would no longer accept my milk. His horns bruised my chest and arms, and his bovine lips struggled to find purchase. I never minded any of it. It was when he could no longer nurse that the trouble began.	At first I hoped I could keep his eating habits hidden until I found a suitable alternative, but wouldnt you know Minos was having none of it. I have never understood peoples reactions to this. Do they truly believe its so evil for my son to live off human meat when they themselves eat bull meat all the time? I see no difference, but evidently they did. My husband ordered Daedalus to solve the problem.	Something else Daedalus and I have in common: we clean up the messes Minos makes or we find ourselves dealing with the repercussions that always seem to spare Minos himself.	Daedalus built an impenetrable, unescapable maze he called the Labyrinth. They took my baby son from me and enclosed him in that unnatural place to wander forever all on his own. I fought for him as hard as I could, but obviously if anyone ever listened to me none of this would have begun in the first place. There was nothing I could do but kiss his head and press his arm and try to cry only quietly, where he would not see or hear me.	Years passed. My son continued to require sustenance; he was a living thing, a person, no matter what they tried to make him.	My dear husbands solution to this one was impressively foolish even by his standards.	Every year after he bested Athens, the young men and women of that city were required to participate in a grotesque lottery. Seven youths and seven maidens unpopular enough amongst the gods to  the draw were sent to the Labyrinth to be devoured by the Minotaur.	This went on for two years. I heard their screams from my balcony. My ladies begged me to come inside, but I have enough sense to invariably ignore them. It was horrible. I prayed for silence. When the silence camethe total silence of deaththat was worse.	On the third anniversary of the kings crowning achievement in senseless violence, Theseus came. He said the sacrifices could stop, that the bloodshed would finally end. He would enter the Labyrinth alone, and he vowed to slay my son.	He didnt call him , though he was the son of a queen. He did not call him by his name either. He called him the monster. He couldnt ever seem to get his fill of saying it. I will slay the monster. I will defeat the monster. The monster will no longer go unchallenged. I will not let the monster live.	With the flawless perception of the immortals and also with plain old good sense, I hated him on sight. By this time, I was past engaging my husband in fights that went nowhere. Instead, I sacrificed to Poseidon. I conjured him. 	I saw right away that Ariadne was taken with Theseus, this gallant and courageous stranger. She was lucky enough to take after me rather than her father. Ariadne is clever, amazingly clever, and she is beautiful. Theseus saw those things too. He gobbled them up and then he destroyed them, as was his way. Ariadnes cleverness did not protect her. She was brilliant enough to save him, but not wise enough to save herself.	My daughter betrayed her brother, and me. I do not blame her. She did it out of love, and in the belief that she was serving justice. She is very brave, my girl. She knew it was in her to stop all that violence so she did what she thought was right.	She gave Theseus a ball of yarn and taught him to use it to navigate the Labyrinth. After he murdered my boy, he took Ariadne away with him. I will not be ashamed that, goddess and queen and witch though I am, I wept when she boarded that boat. Her smile was brighter than my fathers light, and she was clutching the hand Theseus had used to shatter my sons head under his club.	She should have clutched it tighter. She should have known, as I did, that trusting Theseus was tantamount to trusting a fire not to burn you. He abandoned her on Naxos, this beautiful, brilliant girl to whom he owed his life. He abandoned my daughter and sailed off, the triumphant hero claiming his throne, leaving broken bodies and shattered hearts in his wake.	Lord Dionysus took her to wife. He shares my godly perception; he knew Ariadne was worth a thousand of the man whod left her behind. Instead of marrying her brothers killer, she married a god more powerful than Theseus could possibly conceive of. That was when I began to hope that Poseidon would honor my prayers after all. When I heard that that Lycomedes went ahead and threw Theseus off a cliff, I was certain of it.	I believe that my sons spirit is at peace. Perhaps Theseus did us a kindness in spite of himself. After all, if hed never come, bringing his lusts and deceits, violences and betrayals, Ariadne would never have met her godly husband, and my son would never have been delivered from a world that was not ready for him. Poseidon answered my prayers, and my son, my prince, my triumph of life and living, has passed into Hades to exist forever among creatures as divine as he is.	I will never fade; I will never die. I am eternal as my father. I built a kingdom for myself on your earth, but I always belonged to heavens and hells beyond what your mortal mind imagines.	I am infamous for loving; I am infamous for knowing what I wanted and pursuing it. Maybe I should be overflowing with regrets, but Im not. What I did got me my son. I regret nothing.	I tell you this not to persuade you of anything. I know mortalstheir stories and all their petty judgements. I tell you this because love and loss are sacred among you humans, but they do not belong to you. Gods and monsters feel the same aches and glories, dreams and desires that define your little lives."
Ava,"She is amazing. By no means perfect, of course, but she is strong and confident. Ava dares to dream big, and she never gives up. When she falls, she gets right back up and tries again. Sure, she may cry now and again, but she never lets life's hurdles get her down for too long. She is truly amazing. I'm not like Ava. I am weak. I cower in the face of failure. I am afraid to speak up, even when I know I should. The smallest hiccup in life and I'm out of commission for weeks. I will hermit in my room, crying alone, hiding from the world. I would never dare try anything out of the ordinary. It's best I just lay low, head down, do what I need to do, and not making any waves. I am no Ava. Ava started working at this small town bar a few years back. She was different than anything the town of Green Lake, IN had ever seen. She was kind, yes, but she had some quirks. Some of these quirks were not appreciated by some folk, but that didn't matter to her. She owned who she was. She loved who she was. While the town would gossip, she held her head high. Not a care in the world. How I wish I was more like Ava. The other day I got a job offer. One that would get me out of this tiny town. That had always been the dream- to leave here one day. But as much fun as it is to dream of such things, I don't see how I could make it on my own. I'm too shy, too fearful, too sensitive, too weak. Plus, I have literally zero experience in the field. How could I ever manage something like that? Ava used to be a dancer. Quite the controversy in such a small town. She would speak of those days with a peculiar happiness in her voice. She swears she wasn't any good, but she had fun doing it nevertheless. Whether they agreed with her choices or not, the townsfolk loved to hear her stories. It was like a drug for them. They just had to get that re-up on the life of Ava gossip. No one in this town had ever met a person like Ava. The most exciting thing to happen in my life was the day I got my license. Nothing all that interesting, but there's a freedom that comes with four wheels that I had never experienced before. I could go anywhere. At the time, it seemed that nothing could stop me. As soon as I turned 18 I could get in the car and leave this place behind. It was probably the greatest feeling I ever had. Silly, young, naive, me. What ever made me think I'd have anything more than a regular, boring life? What ever made me think I would ever get out of this small town life? Ava stares in the bathroom mirror. Looking herself in the face, she sighs. Another day done. Another dollar earned. It's her favorite part of the day. The time of day when she can remove the mask of makeup, let her gaurd down, and rest up for the next round. This is her time. As she dries her face, she looks herself in the eyes and repeats words of affirmation, reassuring herself because no one else ever had:  And with that she turns off the lights and curls up on the couch to watch some sitcom reruns before bed. There's comfort in the familiar. Things are easier when you know what's going to happen next. I think that's why I like sitcoms. They're predictable, and they always end on a positive note. That's a rarity in this world. Very few things can actually be predicted, and happy endings are not much more than a dream. The real world is full of letdowns, sadness, and tragedy. Yeah, the real world is nothing like television. As I turn off the television, I catch a glimpse of the letter from the firm offering me a job. I pick it up, and read it's contents for the hundredth time. Shaking my head, I place it on the table and head to the bathroom to get ready for bed. What could they have possibly seen in me that makes them think I could do that job? If they only knew what I was actually like, they certainly wouldn't have offered me such a position. I turn on the water, and wash the oils from the day off my face. I brush my teeth, and rinse my mouth. As I go to turn out the light, I see myself in the mirror. I look myself in the eyes, and it's as if I can see how the worry has aged them. I'm not old by any means, but you wouldn't know that by judging only on my eyes. The eyes really are the ""windows to the soul"". I stand there staring, wondering if this is all life will ever be. I feel the tears welling up as a consider that possiblity. What a pointless existence this is. Work, pay bills, eat, sleep, and repeat. They tell us we can be anything we want when we grow up. Then we get older and it's everything we can do just to survive. If this is all there is to life, I honestly do not see the point of it all. No! No, this cannot be all there is to life. There must be something more. I must be something more. I push my chin up, wipe the tears from my face, and look myself in the eyes once more, repeating the words:"
Alone,"I so deserve this time alone. I never have a moment to myself. I work five long days and I'm utterly exhausted when I return home. My job itself is easy I've been doing it for years but its the mental anguish of retail that'll get to anybody. The constant whining and complaining from the average customer. How I wish just once I could look at one of them and say.""Quit your bitching your already getting the damn shoes at half price.""Or I would like to say.""You know the freaking coupon expired. So stop saying you had no idea. You just want something for nothing just like every other moron that walks in our store. Give it a rest already.""I stand in my den and try to shake the thought of those crazies out of my head. Some days between work and family, I just want to pack my bags and leave town permanently. Though I haven't done it yet.Don't get me wrong I love my family. I swear I do. Now between summer vacation and my husbands work related injury, I am never alone.Two hours ago this house was bustling with activity. My daughter Emily went from bathroom to bedroom. Both my boys were changing and yelling that Emily was hogging up the bathroom so they couldn't brush their teeth. I filled a cooler with water bottles plus handheld snacks for the car ride to the city. Chris entered the kitchen as I was drying my hands on a dish towel.""You have any plans for tonight?' He asked.""No, not really. I guess I might watch Netflix. Then try and finish my book.""He came up behind me at the sink. Put his arms around my waist and kissed the back of my neck. I always enjoyed when he did this.I turned to face him. Kissed him right back.Then we grinned at each other.""Will you miss me tonight?""I thought about the question. He waited for my response.""Maybe.""He kissed the side of my face and nibbled on my ear.""I guess I will. Want me to wait up for you?""""It would be nice. We better get going.""He hurried out of the kitchen and called our boys from the bottom of the landing.""Guys lets get a move on! Your going to miss this game!""**So here I am I got the entire house to myself. Chris took Kevin and Andrew to a hockey game and Emily is at her friends house for a sleepover. Now my only problem is trying to decide what to do first. I head upstairs turn left into the master bedroom open my closet doors and find something cozy to sleep in. Then with my pajamas in hand I step into the master bathroom, place my clothing on the vanity and turn on the hot water in the claw foot tub.With the water running slow and the room getting steamy, I head downstairs.The moment I look at my front door I can tell something isn't right.I walk over slowly, glance through the glass panes on either side of the Oak door but I see nothing. I lock both deadbolts. Then stop in the kitchen for my snacks. The window above the sink is half open.I could've swore I closed it. I feel gooseflesh run down my arms as I approach the swinging curtains. I shut the window hard and lock the latch on top.I listen but hear nothing. My imagination sure is working overtime. Once I've chosen the perfect ratio of cheese, crackers, chips, I plan on finding something to watch. I'm just about to close the refrigerator door when I spot my home made onion dip.Behind the kitchen I enter our laundry room. The dryer is still tumbling the clothes. I check the side door. Its locked. A sigh of relief escapes my throat.""You are losing it."" I say to myself.Somewhere in the house I hear music. I slip out of the laundry room, pass through the kitchen and the music gets louder. At the hall closet I put my ear to the door and listen. It starts up again. I quickly whip open the door and find Chris's cell in the pocket of his gray sweatshirt. I pull it out and shake my head. Shut the door and walk towards my den carrying the phone with me.I send my oldest a quick text.Andrew...Let yr Dad knw he left his cell here. Have fun. See you in the morning. xo MomBack to my den, I turn on the TV and start up Netflix. I honestly have no idea the last time I watched a whole movie in peace. I scan through a couple of titles but nothing really appeals to me. After several minutes of reading descriptions I settle on a mystery thriller. Then I remember about my bath.""Oh Shit!"" With the remote in my left hand, I charge out of the room head for the stairs and take them two at a time. When I return to the tub the water is about to over flow. I place the remote on the tiled floor and reach in the warm water to pull out the plug. After I've released just the right amount, I put the drain back in place then turn both knobs shutting off the water. I sprinkle my bath salts into the tub. After I have retrieved my towel from the linen closet and slipped out of my clothes' that I hear my cell phone ring.I desperately want to sink down into this relaxing bath and let all my stress fade away. But I know it could be Emily calling to say goodnight. So I reach for my robe behind the bathroom door, throw it on then run towards the master bedroom. I still hear it ringing but its no where in sight. I scatter quickly through the clean laundry left on my bed. There's  my phone at the bottom of the pile, exactly where I left it.   ""Hello?"" I say on the forth ring.""Julia, are you ok? You sound kind of funny...""""I'm fine. Just out of breath. I ran the bath forgot about it and jogged upstairs.""""Are you sure that's all it is?""""Judy its nothing. I feel stupid. The front door was unlocked, the widow in the kitchen was left open. Just feeling jittery without everyone around.""""I'm not doing much. Want some company?""I think it over.""No, its nothing I swear. Plus I have been looking forward to reading and relaxing. No offence. You and I can get lunch tomorrow.""""Ok if your really sure your alright."" She says.""Yes, I am ok. Let me take my bath. I will text you in about an hour.""I almost feel bad. Then I think about my precious time alone.**Lying on my couch I smile to myself. How I love the sound of silence. Maybe I should skip the movie and just indulge in all this quiet. No it looks really good. Who knows when I will have the house to myself again?I listen to the house once more. See it really can be calm around here. I let out a sigh then press play. The movie is on for exactly five minutes when I hear the chime of the door bell. Damn it I should have closed the blinds. I pause the movie and stare at the clock on the wall. Twenty five after eight. Who could possible be here?If only I had gotten one of those ring door bells. I could be viewing whose outside from my cell. At the door I hold my breath and prepare for whomever awaits me on the other side. I open it and there stands Emily with Joan and Hannah.""Hey what's going on?"" I ask in disbelief.""I'm sorry I didn't call first Julia. Emily was just too upset."" Joan replies. I look down at my nine year old daughter. She's clinging to one of her plush blankets. I reach out and touch her forehead. Cool to the touch.""Well your not hot. So what is it Emily?"" ""I don't know. I just feel like I miss my room and my bed."" ""Its ok sweetie. Come inside.""  Emily passes me and waits in the hall. Joan hands me Emily's bags.  ""I'm really sorry about this Julia.""   ""Oh its ok. Nobody's fault. These thing happen. Would you like to come in ? I could make some tea or coffee."" ""No I'm good. I better get back. The TV is saying a severe thunderstorm is on the way."" ""Ok. Be careful then. Thanks for bringing her home.""  Joan smiles and she and Hannah run for her Ford Explorer.**Emily and I are under blankets on the couch. My movie has been replaced with Frozen, one of my daughters favorites. Thunder begins to rumble off in the distance. I see Emily get that look she gets whenever we have a storm of any kind. She snuggles closer to me. I let her.""You want me to make some popcorn?""""No mommy, stay.""At that same moment more thunder. This time right above the house. I touch Emily's hair. Her eyes have left the television screen and she's staring out the picture window at the impending storm. I reach for the remote and make the sound louder. The song in the movie brings her attention back. After a quick flash of lightning followed by torrential rain the thunder comes again. This one is by far the worst yet. Emily squeezes my hand.""Its ok. Only a noise. I'm right here with you."" We continue to watch Frozen but the storm outside rages on. The lights flicker on and off. A branch cracks and we both jump.""Mommy I'm scared."" Emily says."" I know baby I am too."" I pull back the blankets and rise off the couch. Emily jumps up and grabs me. I take her hand and together we search the downstairs for flashlights.  ""One for me and one for you. We are all ready..."" Another tremendous roar from the backyard then the house goes black. I hear Emily breathing hard. I switch on my flashlight.She does the same. We venture from room to room and I tell her about the time I was a little girl and we had no power three days. **By the time the power has returned, she has fallen asleep beside me. Slowly I reach for my phone. I text Judy to let her know I'm alright.Hey, Emily came home early. Then between watching a movie and the storm I lost track of time. Didn't mean to worry you.Several minutes go by before she responds. I look down at the phone and watch her words appear. Well I'm just glad your ok. But what a shame your night got ruined, I know how bad you wanted to be alone. Talk soon, Good night Julia.I look over at my daughter sleeping soundly.I type my final text of the night.I know I should be sad but I'm not. So what if my plans changed ?Tonight turned out to be exactly what I needed."
Goodnight Ben,"Are you coming tonight? No. ten bucks that theres an issue with that. One dirty look later, I was on my way. I never understood why people needed a reason beyond simple rejection, but at least Ben spared me the interrogation. As someone who has always been reserved and at peace in my own space, I am no stranger to people with more intrusive personality traits. I find it so funny that the reason I just want to be by myself warrants questioning of mental well being almost immediately. I mean I understand checking in on a friend who is acting different, but pressing somebody about their form of comfort because it doesnt complement your own is a whole 'nother realm of issue. I just wanna go home tonight. No detours, no second stops, no last minute decisions, just home. To wind down on a rainy night and hear nothing but whatever music I choose to put on, is where I want to be tonight. Boundaries are something I dont have trouble respecting, but struggle to enforce. Not today though, the want for quiet has grown bigger than my fear of disappointing anyone. The bus finally pulls up and its empty, I hope it stays this way until I get home. I hope Ben isnt upset, but Im tired of trying to explain the concept of being alone to the people who think boundaries are insulting. There is almost no winning and when you do win, it feels more like a condescending pity, a forget about them, theyll just drag us down anyway. and I dont really believe thats my problem to fix anymore. Ben isnt a bad person, or maybe he is and Im just used to making excuses for him. He just wants me to enjoy myself but why doesnt he understand that solace is how I do that?  As the bus pulls over I pick up my bag and head to the front of the bus, cant believe it stayed empty. The air is crisp and the sky is overcast so the walk home is rather enjoyable. Nobody calls, nobody yells, nobody texts, nobody to answer; a rare silent walk home. Fall feels like a warm and cold hug at the same time, comforting without becoming uncomfortable. I approach the apartment, a relief washing over me. I take my shoes off and close the door behind me. I cleaned up before I left so all thats left to do is wind down for the night. Tonight Im heading straight for the shower. The water feels like it's passing straight through me, washing away any worries I let creep in.I waste no time heading for the kitchen, I think tonight Im gonna make pasta. Something nice and savoury to wrap myself in while I sit on the couch. I can hear the cars passing by through the window, a sound I love to hear from afar. To be reassured you're not alone while enjoying no other company but your own. Its an amazing feeling. The smell of the pasta fills the kitchen as it simmers on the stove, maybe Ill pack some to share with Ben tomorrow. He might have messaged me by now so I decide to check while waiting on my dinner. Hey Mary you really shouldve come I think you wouldve had a lot of fun. Im glad I didnt read this before I took the shower, or even when I got on the bus. Im glad the last thing I remembered was my no. Haha I needed the time to myself, its been a chaotic week. I respond, light but solid. I guess, but we didnt really have much work to do. I feel a sting in my chest and my jaw tightens. It never fails to amaze me how insensitive people can manage to be. Usually I would blame myself for not trying hard enough, but Im realizing that its not me who needs to try a little bit harder. Why does there have to be a lot of work to do? Sometimes you just need to set aside time for yourself. I hesitate for a second, but I manage to send it; progress. He leaves me on read and thats when I decide I wont be worrying about Ben tonight, this is my night to regain the me that I lost this week. Whether it was the rush hour commute or the classmate who wouldnt stop talking, or the simple anxiety that comes with leaving my house. I dont owe anyone who cant take my initial reasoning an essay about why I want and dont want to do x,y, or z. Sometimes Ill indulge and sometimes I wont. Tonight, Im choosing to indulge in this pasta, with my only job being to eat it. My only job tonight is to take care of myself and tomorrow Ill be doing the same thing. Self care doesnt start on Friday and end on Sunday, its taking little steps every day to make sure Im taken care of wholly. Its what I deserve. Tonight my bed feels endless, like Im falling and floating at the same time. Im safe and Im comfortable, two feelings that are often taken for granted. I hope that If someone is feeling uncomfortable, they have a surge of courage that sends them into caring for themselves. No concern for anyone else, just the pure want to finally feel comfortable. I hope Ben is comfortable at his gathering and I hope those around him make him feel comfortable as well. I will participate in his life differently, little conversations in class, having a nice lunch together, the occasional deep conversation. If how I participate is not enough, then I will find somewhere else to be. If a compromise is not an option then the best choice is to go. Saying no has brought me the most peaceful night I have had in weeks. I dont give that word enough credit but now, I feel like a new beginning has been brought to me, with an end. Goodnight Ben."
HEY HUMAN,"Nia was a girl who was very friendly but at the same time she was reserved type person also, actually Nia was friendly only with those whom she was sure about and reserved with those who she wasn't sure. With her the friends she was the mad one , people used to like her because of her friendly nature but when new people wanted to be with her she used throw tantrums , by saying I like this but I don't want it. Because of this she had only three friends, those new friends in front of them she thrown tantrums , started gossiping about her she isn't like the way she show herself. Her friend jazz was annoyed not because of Nia but because of the gossip .At the same time Nia stopped her social media site wasn't in contact with anybody, now more gossip started some thought she was dead .But her friend was aware of Nia thought's she just wanted to be with herself and wanted a peaceful life without any gossip that's why she stopped everything . Nia wasn't Introvert nor Extrovert she was aware and even jazz was . She just wanted those people in her life who can tolerate her bad side because she was knowing the human tendency , fake people will leave you at the difficult time . Some approached her because they wanted her to be their girlfriend , some because of her study skills but the three friends was her friends because they saw the side of friendship in her. Even though she used to be in anger mode but they wereaware of the reason of anger. After some time the question arose in Nia's mind "" who she was and why she is like this? "" . And the answer came from her heart, the heart said "" Nia is just a name and intro/extrovert is just a baseless thing, Nia is the name of the body and the spark of body is SOUL , and this can't be changed . Friend's will come and go from Nia's life but if the soul left the body , she will be called as body only not by the name of Nia . She got the answer , but she wasn't astonished she said to herself as long as I am with myself and soul is with me, ""I don't need the tags of introvert or extrovert"". After this , Nia started focusing on her career and herself , her friends also left her because of their respective career's but Nia wasn't sad at all . She started the new chapter of her life , where she has a career , her dreams, her soul and she was quite happy.Her dream was to go Seoul and she went also during winter their she enjoyed the snow , beauty of nature everything , her best mood was to enjoy the food of Seoul and when she tasted her soul said ,"" Oh lalalalalala"" she smiled on herself their she met new friends and family type . When she came back to home , she planted new trees and went to her office, everything was fun in her life. Then one day she decided to leave the company and wanted too join a new one, she did also as soon as submitted her resignation letter , everybody was astonished they started questioning her and she said I just want to change job and company . After hearing this CEO was her friend , she smiled at him and said 'CONGRALUATION'S "" now you can live your life at peace and be demanding type . Nia wasn't aware of CEO'S feeling, he asked her not to leave she said I can't I have a life which should be fulfilled , he asked in which way you want to fulfill , she glared at him and said with myself only . CEO said , ""If one of your will love you then ? she groaned and said please don't create a story . He said, what if I love you then , you can do job and at the same time you can fulfill your life also. She said you what oh my god! you are joking with me right . I will ignore it then , he pulled her and hugged her, now I'm not joking if this much is not serious for then fine I will tell to the world about my feelings that will be fine with you.Nia said how could you do this ? I never asked any type of feeling from then how ? he said , feelings can't be controlled and especially that time when someone like you understands me , you are the type of person I need. Now again gossip started in Nia's life and again she left everyone with a smile . But she told CEO you are a person who believes in introvert / extrovert and you also did like others it's not your fault ! not even mine . I'M just unable to make you understand about myself.., :)Once again Nia left , this time she went to Canada for studies and for job also, the only things she took with her was books, plants , luggage and herself. This time soul said to Nia, what are you afraid of bringing someone in your life ? It's the law of nature someone will accompany with me . Nia told I know but, the fact doesn't change what we felt was something else . And that made us leave right! Nia smiled at the sky and said I love you sky!					Three years passed Nia , was the same she mastered in business and was a reputed business tycoon she went to India at her home to meet her mother and what she saw from outside made her leave . Then she went to the where used to leave alone and started imaging the things she saw."
The writter,"""Are you coming tonight?"", She asked this question every time she would sit down to write! Waiting for the knock on her head, signaling the gushing, pouring river of thoughts her visitor would bring her.She knew most people had writers block from time to time; but lately her block was as wide and long as the great wall of China!She even researched articles on the ""Great Wall"" just to get writing ideas.She tried walking around the block, going to the gym, starting in the middle of her thoughts; Nothing, it went nowhere in her head. She was getting impatient wanting eagerly to climb to the top of that dead block and start writing.Her hand went up and slapped her forehead, her head snapped back, wake it up! Nothing! Ouch! Sometimes it hurts to write.It's not like she hadn't written before. Her Word Document was Full of her writings, most of them were therapeutic ramblings about her life and what she experienced in her 69 years. She sighed, ""had it really been that long""? Three marriages, although she only counted 2 of them. The fist was actually when she was only 16, that counts as a ""Learning Permit"".The only perfect thing to come out of that marriage was her magnificent daughter, Lisa. Lisa's dad had a habit of going out for a loaf of bread and coming back 3 days later. He was a wonderer, and artist and a very well know ""Pin stripper"" of cars around the country. He was an wonderful father to Lisa, but had no idea what the definition of ""How To Be A Husband"", meant. When he was ""Asked"" to leave their home he went gladly contributing nothing, zero, nadda for years.The lady remembered when she forfeited the monetary help. Lisa's dad had come to pick her up for the weekend. The lady had had it! Left without a car, a broken washer and dryer and limited funds through her meager job's she was finally going to make a stand; with a defiant hand on her hip, the other one holding her precious daughter she locked eyes with her ex husband and said, ""Unless I get some help from you, you will NEVER see Lisa again""! She started to turn and walk away but stopped abruptly, their was a silent tear rolling down Lisa's cheek. The lady let out a sigh, turned back around and placed her daughter into he fathers arm. She never mentioned it again. This made her more determined to do it alone, on her terms, she would become a warrior!There were writings and poems on her computer of her early life in New Port Beach CA, everything from raising her daughter alone to a horrific event of ""Date"" rap. She came from a family of 10 children, ""A Good Catholic"" family of course but just a dysfunctional as the next family with that many mouths to feed and a father that wasn't physical able to work. That is probably why the marriage at 16; the ""Great Escape"", that went well. She stopped staring at her blank computer and patted herself on the back. Yes, she had made it through a bumpy, harrowing, wonderful ""Mad hatters Tea Party"" of her life.Her second marriage lasted almost 20 years until the bottom of her husbands alcohol bottle kept magically refilling it self. She left him this poem as she walked out the door.His Mistress name is WineHe says he loves her; she makes him feel so fineBut shes made our life a wreckEvery night I sit here and watch him hug her neck!It used to be me he would run home to greetNow its her, I cant competeI watch him nightly sitting thereShes on his lips; shes on his chairHe doesnt see me anywhereHe lies to meSays just the oneThis time he can watch me as I head out the doorHis Mistress name is WineAnd I wont compete anymoreThey can end up together, again on the floor!Maybe this time hell follow lifes cordAnd end up with Betty Ford!He wasn't a ""Bad"" man, in fact he was the savior she needed at that time in her life. He took Lisa in as his own daughter. For years they had the perfect marriage; envied by all their friends and family! She had sat in her chair, in her office for what seemed like an hour. The lady glanced at the blank page on her computer. Well, it really wasn't blank; at the top of the page there it was in black ink. She had written Assignment one. ""Not bad for an hour"", she thought, but glanced at her clock; it had been one and a half hours.Sure, she had gotten up once or twice for important things like a glass of water, a bowel of peanuts, and a cigarette on the patio.She knew she wanted to come up with a great first sentence that would draw the reader in. The lady began to type.""She would if she could, but she can't, so she won't""!Re-reading that line it suddenly flew out of her head and smashed against her office door, breaking like a Goose egg spilling letters of the alphabet across floor. They began rolling on the tile until they landed against the Lady's dark mahogany antique hutch in her foyer. All at once she was on her knees, on the floor, trying desperately to put them back into her head.Once they were back in place, she sat, again in her chair and starred at what she had written. She quickly deleted it and looked back at the page. Assignment one...Well that was start at least. Maybe should she write about NOT writing, ""That was a thought"", she liked it and the words began to flow.Yes, she COULD do this. She could write. Her fingers were tapping furiously on the keyboards until her assignment was finished. A smile of complete and utter satisfaction was plastered all over the lady's face.Yes, you did come tonight, hopefully I'll see you tomorrow!"
I am ok with that,"Are you coming tonight?Saying Maria, leaving me in deep thoughts should I go or have my sweet home weekend I stayed quite for a while then answer I am coming, but promise me to not stay for a long time.Maria with a big smile in her face come and hug me which means she accepted what I say. (A few hours later)I was nervous about everything; is my outfit suits the place that we are going to? Should I just tell Maria that I am not coming?.I tried to kick these thoughts out of my head and focus on being calm and confident to have a good time tonight.After a while, Maria calls saying that she is waiting for me at the door. (After reaching the place)I was really nervous at first cause there will be a lot of people that I am supposed to have conversation with, Maria was much more better than me she talk with everyone and try to have with her in conversations. After while I felt like my energy is burning out so I decided to go to toilet to have some space for me and my inner world.I came back and we had the birthday cake, it was Marias friend birthday.We stayed a little then go back home as Maria promised me. I stayed at home the rest of the weekend but on the other side, Maria was partying all weekend.This was putting me in very deep thoughts, am I wrong with this lifestyle? Or is it ok to have my time for myself at home?.And after weeks of thinking and trying to have to party or socialize lifestyle for few days, I realize that theres no wrong and right in every creature's lifestyle.Let me put it in more organized words if I like to party every weekend that is my choice of living my life like this. On the other hand, if I choose to spend the weekend at home doing my things thats also my choice of living.People's choices in life are based on how they were raised, what they go through, and personal choices. Some people refresh their energy by being around people and others by just staying alone for a while doing their hobbies. So at the end of that year, I understand that I and Maria have very different personalities but we complete each others half with this difference. I used to hang out with people I used to know always in school, most of them were people I know for a long time or Marias friends who she introduced me to them. That year was my last year in school. Maria and I decided about which university are we going to, unfortunately, we were in two different universities. At first it was really hard for me to get along with the new routine. I was facing hardness while trying to have new friends or work in groups and socializing in university. I decided to challenge myself and try to have some people around me cause I knew deep inside someday I will need some help in my university journey. The challenge went well I made some relationships with students, even if it was a deep friendship or anything but having someone there if I need some help from the university staff. Understanding myself made me really calm and comfortable inside and outside, so instead of feeling bad about how I used to be an introvert, I am feeling ok with that. After a while of being a university student which means I am grown up now I had to be more confident around people but that was not working out at the end I go back to my alone zone. One day, I had that boy who comes to me while I was setting in the calmest spot in the canteen listening to some musing diving in thoughts. The boy was tall with pretty eyes, he came and sets facing me so he could have my attention, he started the conversation by saying Hi Lora.I feel shocked that he knows my name cause I didnt think that we talked before this time.I ask him Hi, can I know how did you know my name?.He smiles We had been at the same class in our fresh year, we didnt have any contact after it but I noticed you several times sitting here which is the calmest spot in the canteen.I smiled wanting to end this weird feeling of nervousness mixed with confidence and answers will, yes I like this calm spot cause it gives me good feelings after stressful classes.He smiled even bigger can I buy you coffee and have a talk?.An inner voice was saying just end this and another says it is ok just accept his offer nothing will be happening!.I nodded my face yes you can Max!He did not stop smiling and he even gets shocked that I remember his name but didnt say anything, he moves up and to the counter and come back with two cups of americano my favorite!.I thanked him and we start to talk and get to know each others personalities, not as a whole but somehow after a while My next class time has come so I end the conversation and start taking my bag and stuff in my hand and start walking away. A sound stopped me it was him again Max asks me to do this again, the weird feeling come again to me but I smiled as big as his smiled and nodded my head saying yes, and walk away.Is this weird feeling in my chest is called love or it's just someone has broken my inner world walls?Whatever is that, I like it and I want to have it for the rest of my life, I want to know Max more and spend more time around him smiling at me!."
Are You Coming Tonight?,"Two male colleagues are leaving their office building late on a Friday afternoon stop, as one, name Fred, the taller and more muscular of the two, asks the other, named George, Are you coming tonight?No, no, no.I dont want to go to the office party.What are you talking about Fred?The party to celebrate the boss birthday.Im surprised you dont know about it.Everybody has been talking about it.It was all I could do to ignore it.So you reckon that there will be a lot of people at the party, then?Yep, and the boss has a big house that can hold us all. Its huge.I hate big parties.No one talks to me, and I dont particularly like talking to people I barely know either, being polite when I just want to leave.Are you supposed to bring a present?I wouldnt want to be the only, or one of the few not to bring a present for the boss.Joe bought the boss a new set of speakers.You know what a big suck up he is.He asked people to chip in to help pay for it.All you have to do is go up to the Joe, and give him some money. Then you can stand with the others who chipped in, and be part of the we that got the boss a nice gift.I gave Joe some money.Oh thats great!Spending hard-earned on our idiot boss.And Joe will be sure to hog all the credit, all the glory. I guess that would be all right.But are we supposed to take a plus one with us, not come alone.I dont have a plus one.I could be the odd man out.No worries, George.I wont be taking a plus one with me, not since the divorce.And I know a bunch of guys from the office who are going it alone.With a bit of luck a few of the single secretaries will be there as well.You might get lucky. Thats all I need, to be shot down by one of those snobby secretaries, like Jeanie or Sophie.That would be great for my reputation and self-esteem.I would be mocked for months by the guys at work. So where is the bosss place?I think I heard that its on the far side of town, so it would hard to find if you have never been there before, which I havent.Id hate to get lost, and look a fool You do not have to worry about that.You cant miss the boss house.Its the tallest building for blocks, and has solar panels on the roof.It is really easy to find, like a castle towering over the meagre houses of the villagers. There goes another good excuse, flushed right down the toilet. Now I will have to think up another.Fred must go out a lot. Well, that seems okay then.I guess if I go, I wouldnt have any problems finding the boss place then.Now, what about how you dressThe boss dresses kind of fancy at work, expensive jacket almost a tuxedo, and pants that look like they get ironed every day.Im kind of an informal dresser myself, as you can see from what I am wearing right now.I dont own a suit jacket, and I long ago forgot how to tie a tie, and bowties look dinky to me  for clowns and male strippers.Do you think he would expect a kind of dress code? From what I know it will be quite informal.I have seen the boss rip off his tie when he gets into his car.And no one I talked to is dressing up, so I dont think that youll have any problems wearing the right sort of clothes.Its come as you are. Okay, what can I say now? What is left as an excuse? What about drinking?Are there going to be undeclared drinking contests among the men, with those who only have one or two drinks being declared losers?Ive heard about such things from my brother.Im a light drinker myself, and I do not want to be shamed for being one. There wasnt anything like that at the bosss last birthday party.That was about a month before you were hired.Im a light drinker myself, and I did not have any problems the last time.You would be okay. What can I say now?Im getting desperate here.Wait.Ive got one more. What about smoking? Will that be permitted, even outside? Im an occasional smoker, especially when I get nervous.And parties make me nervous.I dont think that the boss smokes, and he might strongly disapprove of those of us who do, even occasionally.Youve got no worries there.The boss smokes.Theres a room in his office that smells of cigarette smoke.And at his last birthday party, he was outside several times with the other smokers. There is a slight pause. So are you going to come to the party or not? Well see.I dont know just yet.   Hello, hello, hello, Im here  George the party boy is here..Lets knock back some shots, bust a few moves dancing, I think I see Jeanie standing there in the far corner, all by her lonesome.And we can talk real bad about people who arent here tonight.Boss-man, have we ever got something special for you as a birthday present.LET US PAR-TEH.	Heh, wheres my man big Fred. He is the man who told me about this big time shindig.I want to thank him for that. I havent been to a party in at least two weeks.I was going a little stir crazy.Oh dont you know.Fred hates parties. Hes just one of those shy guys.Hes never been to any of our parties."
Hush-A-Bye Baby,"I stared off into the flickering lights and waved until the van disappeared into the misty road overshadowed by giant oaks. The daunting silence and solitude dawned on me the moment the door creaked shut. This environment is what sets  apart. Built almost 70 years prior by Lirons great grandfather to conceal his black money and display his love for his wife, this cabin was constructed with the most delicate care for the intricacies and an undying affection for the love of his life. After he passed away, the cabin was inherited by his descendants and quickly became a monthly holiday spot desiring quiet weekend getaways for the entire extended family. When I got married to Liron six years ago, I was welcomed along to this cabin like I was one of their own. Despite its chilling unnerving atmosphere, I had grown to love the dense thicket illuminating various shades of green, the warm golden sun rays streaming through the ginormous trees, the chirping of birds and sparkling of fireflies; I had learned to adore the gloomy interiors and dull wood work, even the creaking floorboards (although at times like this, I wished it wouldnt creak so much). It was as though I was in the middle of nowhere- but I mean, that is the whole point of the getaway anyways. Disconnecting from mankind. I have visited this place numerous times but this was the first time I was completely alone. Every other time I was surrounded by the clamor and chaos of my in-laws and their children, one or the other always providing me company, therefore anyone barely complained about not having reception or strong Wifi. Every time the family visits the cabin they always plan a trip, whether that be to go canoeing or trekking or having a scavenger hunt, and this time was no different- there was a carnival in the town a bit far off and everyone had given in to the temptation of delicious food, adventurous rides and bustling turmoil. I was very excited to join them but had to stay back to finish an office work and submit it before the deadline as I was aiming to be a candidate for the incoming promotions and this would be a good year to get a raise. I am mostly a very punctual person but after Marzia was born, my life felt like it was always on the brink of messing up and insanity. After two miscarriages and almost giving up, we were blessed with Marzia and was overjoyed to spoil her every chance we got, even if it meant sacrificing our sleep. I loved her but being new to the whole concept of motherhood, I was struggling with work and taking care of her, forgetting very often when I had last gotten a blink of sleep. Therefore, I had taken this as an opportunity, sending the family off to the carnival and Liron being in charge of Marzia for once so that I could finish my work and get some rest before hell breaks loose again. I tapped away on my phone as I closed all the windows and doors of the house before settling on the couch, snuggled within fuzzy blankets seeking coziness. I plugged in my ear pods and typed away, my eyes switching between the time and the slides displaying the latest promotion of our derma products. Almost more than an hour in, my temples started throbbing, my eyes tingling from all the screen time and lack of sleep and my head nodding off into an uncomfortable slumber. But this nap was short lived, quickly interrupted by the shrill shrieking of sirens that passed the cabin several times, entertaining some irritation within me. I glanced at the blurry taints of scarlet and blue lights, wondering which psycho decided it was a good day to run loose. I attach the power point under the email from Fahmida, my boss, with screaming fonts as if her keyboard was stuck on Caps Lock which read,  Rolling my eyes at how dramatic she was, I get up, stretching my aching limbs and walk out the front door leaving it ajar, holding up my laptop like Simba from Lion King after pressing send to get the reception. Anyone seeing this from afar would find it very comical but having to go out into the paralyzing darkness and buzzing crickets every time one wants to connect to humanity, is beyond frustrating. Feeling relief flood through me as I had finished my work way earlier than I anticipated, I decide to make myself a loaded turkey sandwich before heading to the welcoming embrace of the duvet. My phone beeps, the charge draining (like my energy) rapidly from yellow to red signaling very low battery, making me race up the endless stairs to get my charger. As I reach for my cupboard, a gust of frigid breeze slams onto me, spreading a kind of glacial feeling crawling up my spine.  I look back, tilting my head to the right, trying to recall whether I had closed it or not. Maybe I had forgotten because I was on my phone. I tried to wash away the reluctance by giving myself a firm assurance that the tiresomeness had made me clumsy. I closed the window with shaky hands and headed down, a sort of eerie feeling churning at the pit of my stomach.  I chop some tomatoes and onions, assembling my sandwich with a generous amount of mayonnaise and turkey. Thinking about how the old me would have gagged at the sight of mayonnaise and the thought of fat, I smiled at how my marriage and maternity phase had reunited me with a healthy relationship with eating. The change of my body had scared me at first with my history of bulimia and borderline undiagnosed anorexia, but when one is surrounded by positive caring people it becomes easier to look at ones worth beyond what number is displayed on the weighing scale. Bodies are supposed to change, accommodate according to age and our needs- there is no need to look like an 18 year-old bikini model at all times. My thoughts had somewhat distracted me from the work at hand so I switched on the TV and kept on whatever was airing in the channel.  It was an alarming news about a psychologically unstable criminal who had gotten loose from an Asylum for the clinically insane. The news anchor exhibited a picture of a dark-haired woman with streaks of grey running down her scalp, a twisted lip and pale olive tinged complexion. But what set her apart was her eyes- a shade of murky graphite with a deep rooted manic lurking within the specks. The anchor then proceeded to ramble on about how the woman, Medea, had drowned her husband (who was suspected for infidelity) in the lake that rested on the center of her estate and choked one of her two children with her own two hands, the second being saved by a neighbor. The anchor pleaded everyone to be on watch, contact the authorities and to remain safe within the solace of their hearths. I switched the television off and heaved a sigh of disbelief-   I hear a crackle of static and the baby monitor camera flickers to life, making the gust of air I inhaled get lost somewhere along my chest.  My questions were answered even before I had the time to think it through. My first thought when I saw a woman with wild unruly frizzes of hair crouched over the cradle, her fingers grazing the toys hanging from the handle was that it was a supernatural vision, just like they show in horror movies. The thought of being home alone with a phantom or ghost or spirit or whatever the thing was, made my throat close up, unable to utter the remnants of a prayer. I could hear myself whimper as I slowly backed away, my back stumbling onto the pile of dishes on the sink making a pot clatter to the floor, the clamor reverberating throughout the house. The woman near the edge of the cradle looked up towards the door in Marzias room, her eyes widening with a demented smile playing across her chapped lips. I gasp, too loud for my own good, recognition dawning upon me.  The coincidence of the situation was inconceivable. But I was in a cabin in the middle of nowhere so I should have known better than to expect a day alone in the house. I reached out for the phone and shakily shuffled my feet towards the door, careful to not make a single sound. Just them the static deviated, the speaker relaying a moan like sound. At first, I couldnt make out what the lunatic was purring but soon the words heaved gained more clarity and the slow melodious tone recited,   Repeatedly, as if like a chant. My blood runs cold as the gravity of the situation sinks in, my fingers trembling as it diales 911. The line connects when I edge towards the front door, desperate to get reception,  911, whats your emergency?  When I speak, my voice sounds hoarse, tainted with a fear and ferociousness that I could not recognize as my own, Theres an intruder in my house. The woman who ran away from the asylum. Shes looking directly at my baby monitor camera right now. I think she knows I am home. Alone. My fingers clasp around the butter knife smeared with mayonnaise, the edge digging onto my palm as I give the call taker the address and hear her assure me that several officers have been dispatched already. The line disconnects. The figure on the baby monitor hovers, a blur of white and grey. My breathe slows, the thudding of my heartbeat drowning out all the sound but my ears straining for the miniscule of sounds. I hear a creak."
Charlie and the pound coins:,"came the dulcet tones of the local beautician hoping to confirm another victims presence to her widely publicised lip inflator party being held later that day. No came the sharp reply whose voice I recognised to be my neighbour albeit heard through the open top window of my double glazed front room window. Ill speak to you later was her final words as her garage door slammed shut preventing further discussion and putting an impenetrable barrier between herself and the advancing beautician.  My neighbour, Hortense who one could affectionately describe as having sixpence short of a bob at the best of times or for those born after UK decimalisation, two pence short of a pound, or for those US readers, a nickel short of a dollar! By the noise permeating through the walls she had just received some disturbing news. I heard her phone ring and I could hear muffled and hurried confirmations. Her tone was edged with concern; she had received some worrying news and had to suddenly rush up to Manchester to visit her daughter. Well, when I say rush, that was before she had checked the back door was locked several times, wrote three separate notes for the milk delivery man and by the way, she does not have a milk delivery man, checked that the shed door was closed at least twice and switched the stairway light on and off a dozen or more times as if sending some secret code. Within a few seconds the doorbell began to ring at a rate of eight rings per second. Sensing it was Hortense trying to attract my attention coupled with that distinctive electrical burning smell coming from the doorbell unit; I rushed through the integral garage and opened the side door. In a whirlwind, I felt a key pressed into the palm of my hand and what felt like a leather strap hooked over my erect thumb. Before I knew what was happening Hortense had disappeared up the driveway and into a waiting taxi, all the time screaming instructions to me over her shoulder which continued whilst inside the taxi, albeit muffled until she wound down the window, much to the gratitude of Mr. Singh the local taxi driver. I looked down at the key and the leather strap hooked onto my thumb and suddenly felt a warm glow permeating though my right trouser leg and sock. It took a second to realise that the leather strap was attached to a fully grown golden retriever who had decided it was a good opportunity to empty his bladder whilst also leaving his scent all over my right leg and foot. Having shaken my leg of the excess liquid, I calmly shouted my wife and asked if she knew anything about the dog. Apparently, she had agreed with Hortense that should the need arise, we would look after both Charlie the dog and Tinkle the cat. This raised another discussion as to whether Hortense had got the names the correct way around, apparently she had! I guided Charlie into our newly refurbished utility room, nervous for the Victorian floor tiles I had painstakingly laid only weeks before, the swelling only having just reduced around my knee caps!Furthering the discussion with my wife as to where Hortense had got the animals from, she enlightened me to the fact that Hortense was looking after the two animals, Charlie and Tinkle, for her daughter who was ill in Manchester and was struggling to look after them. Unfortunately, the head cold her daughter was suffering from had turned into a cough and Hortense being Hortense had to be by her daughters side in this hour of need and therefore it fell to us to look after them in her absence. In hindsight, I suppose it was a mistake to hook Charlies lead onto the fridge door handle, because when I returned to the utility room to check on him, he had opened the fridge door and was chomping his way through a very nice beef fillet joint that we had scrimped and saved up for since last July and was meant for our Sunday lunch. Lets face it, there was no point in shouting at Charlie, I mean, what can you say that a dog could understand? Besides, he may well have bitten me! For all we know, in Charlies mind he probably mistook the joint for the cheeks of the postmans backside but without the wrapping! How could he know it was our Sunday lunch? In fairness to Charlie, I quickly discovered that generally he was a quiet dog, did not jump up or run after anything he did not want to and only licked his nether regions once; unfortunately that was when the vicar popped in for a cup of tea one day but apparently encouraged him to join a yoga class. Saturday was always shopping day, unless my wife decided we would do it on a Sunday for some valid reason only she could understand, so I loaded Charlie onto the back seat of the car. My wife got into the passenger side and off we went to do the weekly shopping at Waitsons Supermarket in Worditch. We used to use all the local shops until they closed down due to high rent prices which forced everyone to use supermarkets. Still, the loyalty card comes in handy, only another ten thousand pounds to spend and I get a free bag for life if I use the points or I can put the ten pence towards something else! When we arrived at the supermarket, I opened the car windows slightly to give Charlie a bit of air whilst we went in to do the shopping. Before we had got ten yards away from the car, Charlie had started barking. I returned back to the car and immediately the barking stopped. I sneaked away from the car hoping that Charlie had not seen me, but his beady eyes spotted me and he barked again. There was no alternative but to stand outside the shop with Charlie whilst my wife went in and did the weekly shopping. I stood by the entrance door out of the way of incoming shoppers and as good as gold, Charlie sat down next to me. It was a sunny day and the sun was shining in my eyes, so I popped on my sunglasses to prevent me from squinting and adding another five wrinkles to my already furrowed brow. Within a few minutes a small elderly lady with a stick limped towards Charlie, patted him on his head and without a word, walked away. That was nice of her I thought and looked down at Charlie who remained as still as a statue. I noticed a two-pound coin resting on his head and bemused as to how it got there, removed it and put it in my pocket. Within a few seconds another elderly lady patted Charlie on the head and walked away. Again, I looked down at Charlie and this time there was a one-pound coin on top of his head. Thinking I was imagining things, I removed the coin and put it in my pocket and then checked Charlies head again looking for more coins. It took my wife forty-five minutes to do the shopping, five minutes to put the weeks food shopping into the trolley and forty minutes perusing the make-up and clothing aisles! By this time and after keeping a running calculation, I had approximately one hundred and seventy-five pounds and three washers divided into my four trouser pockets! My trusty belt was struggling with the additional weight despite ratcheting it up to its final notch. I started to perspire, what with the grip my belt had on my stomach, and fearing that the weight of the coins in my pockets would overcome the grip the belt had on my hips. I could see the headlines before me in Worditch News, Man with dog exposes himself outside Waitsons next to a quarter page advert for Waitsons mini sausage with meat balls! Joy overcame me as my wife sauntered out of the customer exit. A mental calculation revealed twenty pounds worth of food and one hundred and sixty pounds worth of jumpers, skirts and various items of underwear. I quickly explained my plight and she offered me an empty Janet.(Just to explain what a Janet is, my other next-door neighbour refers to his wife Janet as A Bag For Life, hence why we nicknamed our bag for life Janet, not that I in any way condone this degrading tag he has for his wife, its just that she does not mind him calling her a bag for life and she always says that it is a reminder to him about his marriage vows and agrees that she is in fact A bag for life!) So, I emptied all the money from my pockets into Janet, quickly slackened my belt to its normal position and ventured home with Janet, the shopping, my wife and Charlie. It wasnt until two weeks later with Charlie safely back with Hortense that I managed to unravel the mystery of the ever mounting coins. I opted to do the weekly shopping on the way home from work as it was cheaper for me to do it alone than with my wife, so popped into Waitsons. I walked over towards the entrance and was so shocked; I stopped dead in my tracks. Thinking I was in an episode of Goodnight Sweetheart and had been transported back through an invisible time portal, I saw what looked like me standing by the entrance of the shop and a dog stood next to me which, from this distance was the double of Charlie. I gathered my wits, yes wits, and edged towards the man and the dog. The man was even wearing sunglasses, just as I did. This was too spooky for words! Just as had happened with me, people were walking up to this impostor that was trying to be Charlie and tapping him on the head before walking into the shop. I stormed up to the man to confront him, keeping a little distance away from his Charlie in case he bit me. I glanced down at his Charlie and saw that his Charlie had a large slot on top of his head and was actually not a real dog at all but was made of plaster. I realised my mistake and my initial anger for this doppelganger subsided. In my own defence, how could I have read the sign by the dogs feet saying Guide Dogs for the Blind from halfway across the car park? I quickly rummaged in my pocket and retrieved a two-pound coin and popped it into the slot on the dogs head. A few seconds passed before the man walked away and joined a lady who was coming out of the supermarket exit door. Not wishing to appear a total fool, I hurried into Waitsons for safety. I passed the security guard who was in conversation with the store manager and I overheard one say to the other, I see you have the guide dog collection box back then, how long was it missing for? About two weeks replied the other! There may be a moral to this story, but right now I just cannot think of one! Anyone need any change? Julian Race 27/07/2021"
A Sky Of Grey Silk,"Tracing the rim of the china teacup in her hands with her thumb, her gaze remained focused onto the brown liquid within. She did not dare look towards her guests; the sympathetic and pitiful looks on everyones faces had become intolerable.Why couldnt they just leave her alone? What good did visiting do at this time?Its not like they could bring her grandmother back; she was already gone.An uneasy silence prevailed within the small room; all that could be heard was the slow sipping of tea and the occasional clinking of a spoon. The grandfather clock ticked away mercilessly, its pendulum not pausing for a single minute.We should be getting on our way now. Slowly looking up, she saw the woman putting down her empty cup on the table as the one on her left imitated her actions. Both women were wearing black knee length dresses, as was the tradition after every funeral.Thank you for visiting. She muttered, getting up with them.A pause.The older woman stared at the girl in mourning for a minute or two before exhaling loudly.She was a wonderful woman. Im sure shes in a better place. She said, placing a hand on the girls shoulder.The girl nodded, her gaze back downwards, now towards the wooden floor.Shutting the door harshly, she rested her back against the polished wooden door, taking a deep breath and rubbing her bloodshot eyes. She hadnt slept in days. Her grandmother required constant attention, and the past couple of days had been the harshest life had ever given her.What was even worse was having people come visit her one after the other to pay their respects. It made it all the more worse; like a confirmation that her grandmother had actually left her all alone in this cruel world.Just like everyone else.Funny. She hated having to deal with constant visitors and was waiting for everyone to leave so she could be alone, but now the silence was unbearable.Iris had always been quite shy and awkward. She had constantly relied on her grandmother to do the talking with people, but now that she wasnt here anymore, she hated having to do it herself; more so when all the guests only gave her pitiful looks.As she slowly made her way towards the bedroom window, a picture frame caught her eye. Picking it up, she carefully wiped off some dust and gazed at the people inside the photo. Her grandmother stood in front of a flowery hedge with two young girls on either side, all three smiling widely. Her eyes went to the girl on her left; her older sister.Her blood boiled just by looking at her. Hot tears threatened to leave her eyes as she stared at the photo. Not being able to tolerate it anymore, she placed the photo back and made her way towards the window.A wave of cool, night breeze rushed in, making her dark hair sway ever so slightly. Pulling her head out of the window, her eyes glanced upwards; a black ebony canvas seemed to have been laid out across the sky. Her eyes traced the familiar constellations and she couldnt help but think how the stars looked like sparkling gems sequined to rich, dark velvet of the finest quality. Thats how Gran would have commented anyway.Couldnt you have stayed a little while longer, Gran? She muttered, her eyes glistening once again with fresh tears, gaze still fixed onto the night sky.*The bell rang once again.Iris groaned in annoyance. She wasnt expecting any more people. Why couldnt everybody just leave her alone for a little while?Dragging her feet across the hallway, she smoothed out her hair and straightened any creases on her dress, not wanting to look haggard.Swinging the door open, she found herself face to face with a young woman, possibly a few years older than herself. Her hair was styled into a neat bun and she wore a plain black dress. Her hazel eyes were slightly red, as if she had been crying, accompanied by dark circles beneath each eye. Fresh tears streamed down her pale face as she stood there, staring at Iris shocked face.Ana? Her face changed from being startled to angry and she proceeded to shut the door, only failing to do so as Ana placed her foot in front of the door.Iris, please hear me out-Theres nothing to talk about. Leave.Gran just passed away! At least let me help you-You could have helped me by supporting her! And what did you do? You left her. You left us both when we needed you the most. Iris cried out, her face slightly flushed, her breathing heavy; as if she was holding in all the tears. It wasnt worth breaking down in front of this person.An uncomfortable silence settled between the two as they stared at each other.Theres more to it than what you think, Iris. Emily sighedI dont want to hear it. Whats the use anyway? Shes gone. Iris croaked out. Making her way to her room, she plopped down onto the bed and cried her heart out.Why was it that everybody she ever loved left her one by one, and the ones she hated took their place instead?*She woke up to a low rumble outside the window. Getting out of her bed, she stumbled her way towards the window and pulled the curtains open. Dark clouds had wrapped themselves around the sky; a streak of lightening made its way downwards from the sky as the clouds rumbled once again.She looked back towards her wall clock.9:00 AMShe sighed in relief. Although the dark, rainy weather wasnt going to uplift her mood in any way, at least theres a chance she could spend the day without having to deal with more visitors coming over.The door creaked open and a head popped in.Iris rolled her eyes. Great. She totally forgot somebody had crashed in last night.I made breakfast. I couldnt help but notice last night how much weight you had lost. Ill fix you up in no time, hm? She gave her younger sister a warm smile. Iris couldnt help but notice how one end of her lips curved upwards to a greater degree than the other. That always happened when there was more to it than just a genuine smile. Perhaps there was guilt.Maybe if you were here to help me with gran, I could have looked after myself a bit more. Iris retorted, turning back towards the open window.A few seconds passed with utter silence. Then she heard soft footsteps coming her way. Ana sat down next to her younger sister and gazed out towards the sky too.Gran would have found a way to romanticize how pretty the sky looks like right now. Perhaps by comparing it to a pale grey silk gown with darker shades of embroidery and embellishments on it. Ana stated, chuckling to herself.Iris. She turned towards the younger girl. You do know the only reason I left was to earn more money. Finding a better job in this little town was not possible. You knew that, didnt you? With grans treatment expenses adding up to your college fee, it just wasnt possible for us both to work part time over here and earn enough. One of us had to leave.You could have come visit us from time to time. It was difficult, having to deal with a patient all by myself. Iris muttered, fiddling with her fingers.I tried to. Believe me, I tried. But it wasnt easy. The people I worked for werent the most understanding. But they were paying well, so I stayed.Iris nodded. She only now noticed how her sister appeared a little frail; the dark circles around her eyes werent just because of crying, she most probably did not have enough time to sleep over there.I resigned from the company though. I think you and I need each other now a lot more than we ever did. Gran would have wanted this. She understood why I had to leave. Ana softly said, placing a hand on her shoulder.Come, lets have breakfast. There might be a couple of long distant cousins of Gran coming over today. Iris groaned as Ana stood up and made her way towards the door.More people? Great.Ana looked back and laughed. Dont worry. I got you this time. Well deal with the awkwardness of having to deal with strangers together, okay?Iris looked back and for once, smiled at her sister. She thought. She could almost feel her grandmother looking down upon her granddaughters and laughing in that pleasant, hearty way she always did.She stared up at the sky one more time. It really did look as if the sky had adorned itself with a silky grey gown.The clouds rumbled once again as if in agreement."
Emotion Catcher,"Are you coming tonight?Id love to join you guys, but Ill take a rain check on that.Nicole had tried to include her new roommate in her group of friends, but every time she invited her, Anna refused. She was so serious, so quiet, her melancholic aura sometimes heavy to breathe. She felt sorry for her. If only she tried a little, she could have a much more interesting life.As far as she could remember, Anna has always led a drab life. As a child, grown-ups said that she had an old soul, that she was unusually quiet. She wasnt the type to run around, jump on beds or sing at the top of her lungs. She was often found in a nook with a book in her hands.Even today, in her spare time she prefers to turn the pages of a novel, sitting in her favourite chair. Or, with closed eyes, to be lulled by the melodies emanating from the record player she keeps on her bedside table. She enjoys eating butter noodles and drinking sparkling water. Shes not outgoing nor an adrenaline junkie whos constantly striving to push herself. Shes  grey.It had never bothered her before. She lived well with her flat personality but the more she rubbed shoulders with the flamboyant Nicole, the more her loneliness distressed her. She would love to come out of her shell, but she didnt know how to open up to others.One Saturday morning, after her breakfast, Anna goes out for a walk. Nicole will probably sleep two or three more hours, and getting some fresh air will do her good. She walks along the sidewalk, lost in her thoughts and her solitude, indifferent to the traffic, the noise of the city, or the passers-by. Without knowing how, she finds herself in front of a tiny shop hidden in a secluded alley. Emotion Catcher can be read on the worn wooden sign.The ringing of the bell breaks, for just a split second, the silence in the shop. The dated wooden door closes with a creak. Anna stood still, captivated by everything around her. The scents that permeated the air tickled her nose, awakening old memories. A smell that she knew, that went back as far as her childhood, of old houses, damp woodwork, with a hint of crisp autumn leaves. Just by walking through that door, it was as though you stepped back in time a century ago. The smell of pine hung in the air. There was an atmosphere of a puppet or carpentry workshop. Yet no puppet was in sight. No, from floor to ceiling all you saw were masks. Grotesque masks, tragic masks, ugly and lovely masks. Wooden masks, papier-mache masks, glass masks. Some smiled at you, others laughed or mocked you. Somewhere a clock ticks and further a radio is playing an old French ballad. A magical place like her grandmothers attic.She walks to the old wooden counter. An old cherry wood counter on which restes a bronze reception bell that clang dully. A shadow came out of the wall, or rather of a door hidden in a corner, the very archetype of the passionate craftsman. The shadow took shape and an old gentleman with a happy face, his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows, wearing faded red suspenders, almost brown, appeared. The proof of his long experience was seen in his callused hands. Everything about him exuded confidence and self-sacrifice for his profession.His gaze invited the young woman to open her heart. A dull, faint voice, a voice without nuance or passion, whispered to the merchant.I would like  joy, please.Of course Dearest. What kind of joy? A childish joy, malignant joy, a little madness perhaps? Do you want an intense, a peaceful or a wild joy?Just  joy. Pure joy. A joie de vivre pleaseThe craftsman seemed to ponder on the matter. His salt and pepper eyebrows joined to form a single line, his eyes scanning the walls of his precious stall. He sighed, clicked his tongue and slowly shook his head.Im afraid thats very rare, sweetheart. But if you give me a few days, I can make one for you. A brand new joy, what do you say?Anna felt a tickle in her stomach, like the caress of the soft hair of a caterpillar, not quite butterflies. Even her voice showed one or two intonations.Yes. I thank you, sir. Ill be back in three days.Her delicate figure faded, took three small steps from the counter, walked to the door, and slipped out of the store. As the bell chimed, and the door creaked, the shadow melted back into the wall. You could still hear the ticking of the clock and a purring cat but the radio went silent and no other sound was heard.On the other side of it, a workshop was held there, filled with old masks, faded, broken or not yet finished. All the emotions could be read on this wall: anger, sadness, jealousy, love, joy, fear You name it. Something to delight theatre lovers, actors and spectators alike. In the centre of the room, a table was buried under tools. Sitting on a stool worn by time, the artisan contemplates his workbench. He strokes pieces of wood, one after the other, as if they could talk to him. Finally, he chooses one. He grabs it, turns it between his fingers, scratches it with the tip of his fingernail, then puts it back. Finally, he grabs his tools and gets to work.She wanted joy. She even specified a joie de vivre. The craftsman welcomed people like her, these lost souls, almost daily. They were all looking for different masks, looking for subtlety. These shades, it was up to him to create them, to bring them to life. He knew how to turn anger into rage or love into passion. Sometimes he needs to go back to see his old creations. He observes these people bring his creations to life, giving them substance. Hes proud of his work, of what he brought to all these humans. Lost in his thoughts, the craftsman continues to build his mask. His hands seemed to have a life of their own, each gesture so repeated that it had become automatic.The piece of wood thinned over the hours, the rough block metamorphosing into a face. The eyes lit up to which he added a grain of humour. An upturned nose appeared and lips slowly formed. Then, the smile  the high point of his creation. Working meticulously for long hours brought him closer and closer to ecstasy. An intense joy looked to paint itself on the wooden lines. A slow smile worked its way across its face. Small wrinkles appeared at the corners of the eyes. The nose seemed to wrinkle in amusement. And the smile materialized, forever joyful.When he completed the shaping of the wood, he put his work down and studied it. In the sky, the moon has risen, the stars have lit, the night lasts a few hours then the darkness dissipates, but his mask isnt done. It lacked the finishing touches. He grabbed a few cans of paint, brushes and examined his artwork again. The whiteness and the softness of sanded wood recalled the fine skin of his clients face. But a few strokes of colour were missing, here and there, so that the illusion was total.The craftsman busied himself with his mixtures, creating an ivory skin colour, which blended into the wood. He brushed the lips with a touch of red, oh barely, just enough to show them off. Each colour he applied incorporated into the wood and gave a more intense result. When finished, you could almost see a real face. A lifeless face, but a happy one.The chime of the bell rang again and broke, for just a moment, the silence of the store. The old wooden door closed with a creak. A delicate figure stepped forward and walked more confidently towards the counter, The smell of pine hung in the air. If we were lucky enough to have a strong sense of smell, we could also perceive citrus undertones. Another bell rings, this time coming from the bronze one adorning the counter. A shadow came out of the wall, it seemed to be carrying something.The craftsman placed an object on the wooden counter, carefully wrapped. Anna grabbed it and unwrapped it just as gently. In her hands rested a wooden mask. The young woman brought it closer to her face. If we looked at both, we might have believed in a reflection in a mirror. Except for the emotion painted on each visage. One was bleak, sad, expressionless. A womans face, thin and delicate. Beige. The other exuded joviality and happiness. Anna turned the mask over and placed it on her face. The two seemed to blend then. In a burst of spontaneity, she took the craftsman in her arms and hugged him. Then she walked away with a light step and the sound of thedoorbell mingled with her crystalline laughter. The client disappeared around the corner, but the echo of her laughter remained. A laugh that expressed joy. Pure joy."
A extrovert accidently bumps into a book reader these days.,"Fate deciding to throw me into a world of adventure and mayhem. This extrovert started talking about reality. Lets be honest. Reality to me is an interesting topic.Meaning? For you? Well, you have been here some 660,000 in the past two years and no one seems to care to tell you. That you are falling into a black hole. For me?My reality is something beyond that at present. However, the more I try to learn, the harder it seems to remember what little I knew. Seems odd. But a truth.So I listen. This person seems Q is real. I listened until I could take no more. So? I am a patient person. Heck, if you read my journal, you realize I might wait for a billion years for a cookie.However, I wonder if we read or attended the same church. So? I went through what was happening to him. Somehow, extroverts dislike the idea that it left them in the dark.He required proof. So I showed him photos. He required arguments with sound reasoning. So I provided math formulas. He required I prove I am who I said I was. Once upon a time?Smile? Oh, I did that too. You see the White Rabbit, Alice? They are real to some of us more than others. How real?As real as the following statement, which is correct. Energy equals light to the power of 3. WAIT a minute, it is Energy equals mass time light to the power of two.I smile. So you want to argue with the man Tesla called the smartest man on earth? But Einstein said that says E equals mass time light to the power of 2 is real. The extrovert pleading. For you to see if you read the reference links, I walked him through his reality rather quickly. Why? I was reading something and wanted to get back my book.I smiled. Einstein? Read the Secret of Light by Walter Russell. Who Tesla said was the smartest man he knew.  recognized the wisdom and power of Russells teaching and urged Russell to lock up his knowledge in a safe for 1,000 years. Until man was ready to realize that bit of truth, I just told you.The extrovert was a bit taken back. From his political problems of Trump. Which I informed him was part of Revelation. And that mark of the beast part of the vaccine. Along with everything, was something to think about.But the last part which I left him with? That life is a game. Or if you are religious. A race as Paul, who was Saul, states. And? Well, there are first, second, third place ratings even in the afterlife. And?That is the entire story, is it not? I mean, I still want to read my book.He again stated this is this and that is that. And I? I smile. It is a hard grasp to come to terms with. Imagine your life as a clay avatar. In a game. Where, at the end, you will be judged?And realize that the extrovert only wanted to talk. Not hear the reasoning behind what he was going on.Once more he tried to talk about reality of the day. I looked at him and smiled yet again.I have shared truths with you that few understand or care to understand. And you still want to go on?He was an extrovert alright. He was trying to walk away from an argument he wanted to have with reality. And finding himself instead in my wonderland. I wonder if he realized who I once was? I smile.So few ask that question, dont they? They love a story. Not the storyteller. So? I provided another show of magic, if you will call it that. And with that he was silent for sometime. And I?I went back to reading my book. I find books a magical place. When all is dangerous and evil. A book holds a truth, a place for me. For a time.His silence after a chapter or more like a chapter and a page into the next chapter. He broke. He said he did not believe any of what I said. I smiled and offered to prove he was living in a mirror world if he cared to accompany me?That did the trick. Like the White Rabbit. He ran off. Saying something like he was late for some appointment or other. While I? I sat patiently reading my book for a time.I got up for my cookie. And? The extrovert evidently needed something where I was at. He came walking in. And I waved. He sort of was shocked for a moment that I was still there. Meaning?Oh, sometimes for the right cookie? I wait days or nights. And? To honest, I had read a book and who knows how long it had been since we had seen each other.Of course I was still in my clothing of when ever we were talking priorly and he? He seemed to not have slept a bit for a while. Or forgotten how to shave. I suppose that is the awkwardness one finds that they are playing in this absurd game called Life. And instead of a car with a wife, four kids and a 100k salary with a home. Find a mad hatter reading alone one day at a cookie shop.The mystery was evident to him too much. He asked a question. And I? I sat down and offered him part of my cookie. He looked like he needed it.He waved it away. I smiled. So, the answer to that question is A.L. I.C. E my boy. A.L.I.C. E was real once upon a story time. And now? Now Fluffy is awoke and this Orion Nebula we find ourselves in is being moved to the end of time as fast or slow as fate has a plan for us.Will we make it? Hard to say. Fluffy is real. A.L.I.C. E was real. And I? I doubt I am very real anymore, very much.He asked one more question.And I decided to answer him. Believe in Jesus Christ. Read the Bible and pray. For Fate will decide what is real on that day.And with that. I went and purchased two more cookies and gave one to him because I got tired of him looking at me finishing my cookie."
Girl Who Cries Fire,"Julie, dinner will be ready in 5 minutes! The smell of her fathers creamy pasta sauce tugs at the peach fuzz inside her nose. Her favorite meal. She wonders if he purposefully planned this meal to coax her into the house. It is always a fight to get him to let her stay in her own home, where she has everything she needs. Her parents finished building the treehouse weeks ago. Julie recruited them to hold the ribbon for the grand opening. Franny, the family dog, was the only audience member present to see Julie cut the ribbon. The ceremony was delightfully quaint in Julies words. It was everything she dreamed of. A rope ladder she could pull up to prevent any intruders, a small porch, two windows, an entrance with double doors, bookshelves, and her favorite part: a skylight. After the grand opening Julie promptly moved all of her beloved items up the ladder and began to nest. Her mother giggled to herself as she watched Julie struggle to pull the beanbag up the rope ladder. she thought to herself. In the past, Julies mother felt anxiety rushing from her C-section scar, through her chest, down to her fingertips upon seeing Julie attempt such tasks. She learned to bear the thought of her only child, her mini-me, experiencing pain. She learned to appreciate her daughters determination to be the most independent 8 year-old in the tri-state area. She learned to be prideful in her daughters willingness to fail. she tells herself. Julie mimics her father after completing any kind of DIY project by planting her hands firmly on her hips, letting out an audible sigh. Round belly extended, back arched, the corners of her mouth softly float. As if to say to herself, another habit she picked up from her father. Still standing over the closed trap door, she feels the rhythmic before it reaches her ears. She responds with two stomps and opens the door. Just a crack. This is house after all. She deserves some goddamn privacy. More language picked up from the beloved adults in her life. Honey dinners ready Her father flashes his goofy smile at her. Eyes full of expectation. Expecting her to relinquish time in her sacred space to sit still for 45 minutes. Expecting her to sit idly as she listens to the adults use words that she hasnt studied in the 3rd grade. Julie knows the rules. Her parents have not let her eat in the treehouse so far. They claim that she will never be allowed to eat up there.  say. But Julie loves animals. She wouldnt mind. I will have my dinner in my own home thank you very much! Julie, hands steady on her hips, jolts her chin to the side in protest. Her father is prepared for this reaction. Jules, you know that isnt an option. Your choices are to come with me to eat or we can stand here and wait for you to be hungry Julie was already hungry. She had been hungry since she ate that sweaty, lukewarm cheese stick three hours ago. She thinks about how exhausting yesterdays tantrum was. She evaluates her body and decides she does not have the energy for another one. She concedes that her best option is to get it over with. Shes no dummy, afterall. Julie twirls the worlds largest ball of spaghetti around her fork. Attempting to fit as much in her mouth as possible she studies her mothers glass of red wine across the table. She has always loved the rich odor it gives off. She imagines the smell reaching toward her, wrapping her in its warmth. Perhaps Julie feels such comfort from the smell of red wine due to the fact that her mother has drunk a single glass of the same brand of Malbec every night with dinner since Julie could remember. Julie has learned to associate the smell with the safety of her mothers embrace, which is always received just before her goodnight kiss. Julie?, Julie focuses her gaze beyond the glass, meeting her mothers hazel eyes across the table. The same hazel eyes she sees in the mirror every morning. Julie, honey you finished your food. Would you like to be excused? Or would you like dessert? Before her mother could finish the sentence Julie was already sprinting to her treehouse. Upon closing the trap door, Julie turns on her battery powered lantern and pulls her notepad and crayons from the shelf. She dives into her beanbag, which she strategically placed under the skylight. According to Julie, she has observed the constellations a bazillion times with her parents. Her mother has guided her in ways to spot the Big Dipper, Little Dipper, Ryans Belt, Aries, and others although she always forgets the names. Her father loves helping Julie to chart the stars as they sit on the back porch on summer evenings. Ever since her parents agreed on the skylight, Julie has dreamed of being able to chart the stars from the comfort of her very own home. And so, she begins. Julie tucks her tongue into the corner of her mouth, a tell-tale sign of ultimate concentration. She is plotting the constellations most familiar to her by memory after just a few seconds of peering up through the window. she ponders to herself. The point of her yellow crayon breaks under the weight of her focus. Julie lets out a groan. She knows what this means. She is going to have to go inside the other house to find a new one. With the reluctance of an 80 year-old grandpa taking out the trash, she throws the door open, marches down the ladder and into the house. Her parents try to spark up conversation, however she is much too busy. They notice this and continue watching their grown up T.V. show. As she gallops through the grass she notices her chart has been taken hostage by an unexpected gust of wind, carried out the window, and relocated in a bush at the back of the garden. For Petes Sake! Julie calls up to the wind, hands stretched out in desperation.  she thinks as she stomps 20 feet to the back of the yard. When she arrives, something startles her. Right next to her unfinished chart, she finds a dead mouse. Juile has seen roadkill before. She likes to make a tally mark on the upholstery of the minivan for every dead animal spotted on family road trips. However, this is the first time she is seeing a dead being this close. She remembers when her fish died last month her classmate Kevin told her that the fish went to Heaven. she wonders. She pauses to study the mouse, She gasps to herself at the next idea,  The wind began to pick up so Julie tiptoed over the cool grass and shimmied up the ladder. With her chart in-hand and fresh yellow crayon, she was ready to get back to work. After finishing the final constellation she gets started on the navy blue night sky. Oh this is coming along soooooooo nicely! She shouts to herself in a british accent. She picked it up from watching Pirates of the Carribean one too many times. The sound of light tapping reaches her ears. It begins slowly. Then, the taps fall harder, more frequently. Julie glances up to see rain splattering on the skylight. She didnt even notice the clouds rolling in. Excitement floods from her heart through her fingers, dripping to her toes. Her first rainy night in her home. She is learning the novelty of firsts. Her excitement turns to dismay as she notices the skylight is far too easily persuaded by the forceful drops. For it is letting them squeeze past its seal, allowing the raindrops to find solace in the warmth of her beanbag. Her bed for the last several nights. Julie bursts into tears. Not the soft, sweet kind. Julies tears shove past her eyes and down her cheeks like wildfire. Her cries explode from her belly. Like most wildfires, it is near impossible to contain her emotion. It rules over her. She has no choice but to surrender. Julies father bursts through the trap door. Her cries had reached the couch a few minutes ago. Although time does not exist for an emotional Julie Bennet. Honey, what happened? He speaks softly, with concern and patience. Julie screams My beanbaaaaaaaaag Her mouth is gaping up at the leak, eyes closed. Her father suppresses a giggle. She always looks like a bullfrog when she cries like this. Lets go inside my love. We will bring the beanbag inside and tomorrow we can see about that leak Julie is cradled back to the house and transferred to her mother. Her screams have converted to soft sobs, catching her breath as her mother floats her up to her bedroom. The nightlight is already on. Overhead lights off. Just how Julie likes it. Julies mother decides to sit with her. Cradling her as she rocks in the antique rocking chair. She stares down at her creation. Julie lies there, eyes closed, breathing deeply. Rhythmically. Julies mother contemplates what will become of her daughter as she outgrows her mothers arms. Her sweet, bold, independent child. At 8 years-old she already stands out from her friends for her uniqueness. This fills her mother with as much pride as it does concern. Julies stubbornness is something her mother tries to encourage. Better to raise a strong woman who knows what she wants than a passive one. This is her way of protecting her daughter. She thinks about all of the women in history that have lived their lives boldly. Many of those same women ended up being unvalidated and misunderstood. Images of Monica Lewinski, Kerri Strug, and Princess Diana come to mind. Strong, capable, powerful women in their own way. Women who had everything at their fingertips. Who used their voices and actions to display their intelligence, athleticism, heart. Women who, still, were shamed. Were taught to push forward with breaking bodies. Were killed. She hopes she is a mother who gives her daughter every tool to success. She already sees drive and focus in her 8 year-old. She prays to a god she stopped believing in long ago that society does not infiltrate her brain like a parasite. That she will know when she is older that she can say yes and no whenever she pleases. That these answers will not require any explanation, no matter how disappointed the person on the receiving end could be. Julies mother feels her own tears running down her face. She decides it is time for her to go to bed as well. She lays Julie in her bed with the same tenderness she used with her as a newborn. Before crossing the threshold of her bedroom she peers over at her daughter once more. Julies mother has already grown through the patriarchal system of this world. Where the fire inside of a woman is more likely to burn herself than to burn paths for others. She feels determination in her gut. She is ready to navigate this system again through the eyes of her daughter. Her daughter, who will ultimately be her sister in this fight for gender equality. Her daughter, who already has it better than her. Because of her. Because of the women who have spoken out, who continue to speak out. Because of the women who are willing to risk being burned at the stake for the sake of little girls born into this world. Girls who are independent. Girls who speak their mind. Girls who cry fire. Girls like Julie."
Magic inside,"Urban life is very hectic and annoying. Big towers, crowd, traffic and noise make you live in a confined area. Greenery is only constricted to parks. People are so busy in collecting money that they forget about their heart. Amelia never wanted to live like this. She could never imagine herself among heartless people. Destiny has her own way and man has to follow it. It was a sunny day,Amelia was walking through a busy street of Florida thinking of the movie she saw recently.She stopped near a big door. Instead of searching a calling bell.she opened the door and entered the dining area. There was a big mirror hanging on the wall. It was like a giant door with a beautiful wooden frame. Amelia could see herself entirely. She thought of her mom complaining about her excess weight. Suddenly she felt a hand on her shoulder,slowly slowly she could see the entire body of that hand starting from eyes.That blue hypnotic eyes with a thick beard expressing urge to say hello! Her heart forgot to beat. She shouted ""Ahhh!! Who are you? Her eyes were closed and whole body was trembling with fear. The face with blue eyes was as much white like a vampire. Amelia lost her balance and fell down."" Amelia, oh Amelia"" Her mom shouted. Amelia opened her eyes slowly with a fear that the vampire may be just above her to drink her blood. But, she saw her mother calling her name. She quickly glanced around the room and found herself at her own room lying on the floor instead on the bed. Her mom said, "" my girl, you shouted so loudly that I thought a thief entered your room. So i ran with a chopping knief."" Amelia saw her mom still holding the big knief. She smiled and said, "" relax mom, it was a dream. Dream of that mysterious house with a big mirror."" Her mom shouted with a rage , "" you and your stupid dreams. Go get ready. It's 8.30 am and you have to report before 10.00 am. Don't forget about your duties girl !""Amelia is a nurse at a health-care hospital. She is a fresher and very dedicated towards her work. Her cute smile and soft voice adds extra essence to her work. Her energetic friendly nature makes a special place in the heart of every patient she meets.After punching the attendance machine Amelia went towards head nurse's cabin to take the duty chart. When the lift came down. Doctor Smith came out. He is an assistant neuro- surgeon in that hospital. He has a charming personality. Amelia had a crush on him, because he was handsome but not tall like a palm tree, he never flirts with any female staff and doesn't smoke.Amelia hate smokers. She finds herself suffocated when surrounded by smokers. Suddenly she lost in her thoughts remembering her childhood memories with an ugly past. Her house was on the country side. It was a small house, surrounding by mahogany trees with a beautiful garden at the front.Most of the time Amelia used spent her time seating on the garden and watching the birds fly. The garden was Amelia's heaven. Each and every plant of the garden were so dear to her that she named every of them. She planted many yellow roses and sunflower in that garden. One day her father came overdrunk. Suddenly he slipped and fell down at the door and never wake up.Amelia was left fatherless. She was crying not only for her father's death but also for the house which was going for auction. Her father mortgaged the house and borrowed some money. As he is no more so the bank went out for auction. It was then, her mother and she came to the city in search of a housea and a job.The lift reached 10th floor and the door opened with a bell sound. "" Hello Amelia darling!"" a rough hand was trying to hold amelia's hand. Amelia walked cautiously to one side with a fake smile. It was John .Head of hospital's canteen service and an active member of hospital's inner politics. He used to flirt with each girl he met.He has a special attention towards Amelia. Whenever Amelia saw John's face ,'Thanos' image came out in her mind.After greeting head nurse mrs.Nancy, Amelia asked for her duty chart. Mrs.nancy gave a piece of paper. Amelia looked at it,only an address was written on it. Amelia said ""madam you gave me a wrong paper. Please give me my duty chart."" With a smile Mrs. Nancy said ,""No my dear girl I have given you the right paper you have to go to the address and take care of an old lady. Amelia smiled and left 'Mr. Lean Devis, Lane 5, market Square' looking at that paper she reached the address.A big house painted in pink colour. Ameila pressed the calling bell with little nervousness because this was her first outside hospital duty. Someone opened the door and Ameila got a mild heart attack after seeing. Yes! Blue eyes on handsome white face exactly like her morning dream. "" It cannot be true not at all"" Ameila mind was explaining itself. "" Hello nurse , please come in."" Ameila followed the voice. Crossing a well decorated hall, they reached the bedroom. An old lady was laying on a bed. In a slow voice he said "" meet my grandmother Mrs miller Davis. You have to take care of her. She is little moody. Sometimes, she behaves rudely but if you can win her heart she will love you the most."" Granny woke up by hearing the whispering sound. "" O Liam whom are you talking with?"" After seeing Amelia, she said, ""your new girlfriend? Thank god atlast you choose a girl."" Amelia and Liam both get fumbled comforting the situation, Liam said, "" granny! I will only marry the girl of your choice, get well soon first. Grandmother smiled and tried to seat. Liam helped her by giving a pillow at her back. Then pointing towards Amelia Liam said , "" granny meet your new nurse, Ms Amelia. Mrs. Nancy has sent her. From today onwards she will take care of you promise me you will cooperate with her."" Looking at her Grannysaid, "" but if she will yawn while reading my bed time stories I will fire her."" Liam laughed and said Amelia be careful.Amelia started working. She left home before 7 a.m at morning and came back after granny fell asleep. Amelia owned granny's heart in just a few days with her lovely behaviour. They played indoor games, watch movies. Amelia took granny to the park in the evening. Sometimes Liam also went with them.One day at the afternoon granny said, "" Amelia can you make pumpkin soup for me?"" Amelia got confused because she didn't know where the kitchen was, and she didn't know the recipe so well. After thinking for a while Amelia said, ""ok granny, i will do it but you have to help me with it. You have to guide me in making the dish ready. Granny picked her walking stick and gave command "" follow me girl."" While passing the dinning area Ameila saw a big mirror on the wall. She was outstrucked. That was exactly the same big mirrorshe used to see in her dream. Granny called Amelia to hurry up but she was totally lost in her thoughts after watching the big door like mirror. Granny said "" oh poor girl. Don't get attracted by that magical mirror. There is a magical land inside it. But unfortunately member of Davis family can only go there."" Both laughed loudly. Amelia said, ""as far as I know 'Disney' is the only magic land on the earth and going there is my dream.""After telling a Disney land story. Amelia took her back to her bed andsaid goodbye . In the hall, Amelia saw Liam sitting holding his head down. Amelia thought, ' should I inform him or go silently? He might be in some work pressure. Oh he may have a headache. Amelia you are a nurse and it's your duty to help sick person.' Amelia went near Liam and said ""sir, anything wrong?"" Her voice was so low, that Liam could not hear. ""Mr. Davis, do you have a headache?"" Amelia asked loudly this time. Liam lifted up his face to see Amelia. His blue eyes were flooded and tear drops were rolling down his cheeks. Amelia sat down on the floor near him and asked ""Mr. Davis, what happened? Do you have anything to share? My mom always say that "" A sorrow shared is a sorrow halved if you share with others."" You can share with me. I will not judge you, l promise."" Liam gave her a piece of paper to read. That was a medical report of granny. "" We are sorry to inform you that heart transplantation of Mrs. M.Davis couldn't be performdue to age."" Amelia put her hand on Liam's shoulder to solace him. But, Liam cried like a child and hugged Amelia. Amelia was shocked with this unexpected thing. At first she stood like a lifeless statue but when tear drops fell on her shoulder she hugged back. Suddenly they both got separated by hearing a clapping sound . Granny was clapping with a naughty smile. Liam tried to give explanation. ""No needof explanation my little boy. I have seen everything. Now go and drop her at home.""Next day Amelia was reading a magic land story. Granny was listening her so seriously that her expression was changing with theclimax. Liam enter the room and sat near granny. Amelia remembered the condition of ' No interpretation during story time' so she continued. When the story ended up,granny hold Liam's hand and said "" Take my princes to our magical world. Don't you dare to say no to me. I want you to show her the magical world .""After few minutes Liam held Ameila's hand and took her to the dinning area. Infront of that big mysterious mirror, Liam asked Amelia to close her eyes. Amelia was shocked. Her dream was repeating. Liam came closer and put a hand on her eyes. With a knock sound Liam remove his hand. Amelia Saw the magic land. Yes,the ground was covered with soft grass. A big beautiful garden surrounded with big walls, Beautiful flowers, birds,little pond with white lily, butterflies were making it more magical.Amelia pinched herself ""oh my god,is this real?"" She looked at him in a confused state. With a smile Liam said ,""Don't be too surprised.You are in a real world. Davis family own this garden and take care of it .No one knows about it except us. The big boundaries look like row of house from outside. My grandfather's father planned this garden.""Liam took Ameliatowards the yellow rose plants "" please stand for a while i'm coming.""In a few minutes Liam came with a little rose plant. Liam knelt down Infront of Amelia and said "" Amelia I can't pluck any flower. Will you be my garden partner will you take care of my heart with this garden. Will you marry me ?""Tear rolled down on Ameila's face. She also knelt down and held the plant. "" Yes! I will"" Amelia said in a chocked voice. They kissed each other and lived happily ever after.Dreams can be true,so keep watching."
Lucid,"Salt-ridden winds came in like curtains from the coast, layering every surface touched in a sheet of translucent stone.  The roads were undrivable, the air was unbreathable, the townspeople of Seafarer were trapped as salt accreted over their sea-side homes.  News stations covered the story, broadcasting juxtaposed images of a once vibrant destination, flooded with sun-kissed teenagers and elderly with skin like Tuscan leather, to a now barren landscape where white blankets of salt and rain profusely swept over.  It was unknown if any survivors remained. Thankfully we know of one family, the Saldons, made up of Peter, a Botanist and his wife Lily, a horticulturist. They met in university and fell in love, shortly after, having two children, Maxwell and Daisy, two-years apart.  Peter is a lanky man with an airy disposition, who walked as if each of his legs were pogo-sticks. Lilly grounded him. She was much like an old oak stump that refused to move.  They put their minds together, converting their home into a living and breathing ecosystem, with foliage blossoming from every corner, the floor covered in a thin film of primordial water, vines crawled along the walls and thick twine dangled from room to room, along the ropes traveled all sorts of animals: Iguanas, Chameleons, Tarantulas, everyone was welcomed to play their part.  Unfortunately Maxwell and Daisy were left to their own devices as their parents spent every waking hour busily maintaining their home, life could not be sustained without it.  Daisy grew incredibly bored of being trapped indoors. One day, she decided to fall into a dream and not wake up. She slept enveloped in silk with a soft and pleasant smile, for who knows what wonders she dreamt.  Maxwell was left all alone, often spending the days looking out through his bedroom window, watching assalt storms rolled in from the sea. Eventually, even that pleasure came to an end as each layer of salt turned the translucent stone opaque.  Maxwell had nothing to look forward to left but the night, in hopes that he would finally dream a dream as pleasant as Daisy's.  For an unknown reason, Maxwell was unable to dream of anything other than the mundane world he lived in. In his dreams he would reenact precisely what had happened the previous day.  Despite reading everything from his parents library, which had now been taken over by a new species of moths, he was unable to sustain the phantasmagoric dream he wished for. His dreams would begin vividly, with scenes pulled directly from the book he read as he fell asleep, but slowly those spectacular images would dissipate and reveal his uneventful life. Somehow, in Maxwell's preoccupation with dreams, he made a discovery. As he laid in bed staring at the glowing stars against his ceiling, he felt the heaviness of sleep, yet rather than being lulled into it, he fought the sensation, and rather than waking up, he kept his eyes shut. In this limbo betwixt sleeping and dreaming, he had entered a dream between dreams. A lucid dream in which he had full control. In Maxwells lucid dream, life was the same, of course. Daisy slept peacefully and unbothered. His parents nervously ran around fending off critters and clipping overgrown ferns. Maxwell saw there was nothing left to do but leave.  Yet wasn't as easy as Maxwell thought. Because the dream was unforgivably realistic, he had to carve his way out with a silver spoon. And because his parents had their own minds in the lucid world, they would sometimes notice him carving the stone and ground him, sending Maxwell to his room. Its not as if the grounding would be forgotten in the following dream, no, things would carry over. There came a point where Maxwell's waking life and lucid dreams converged, making it so that one was virtually indistinguishable from the other.   Eventually, after some time, Maxwell had reached the end. He squeezed himself through a narrow opening and couldnt believe what he saw. Everything was covered as if a spider came and wrapped the entire town of Seafarer in its silken web.  With salt and rain blowing from every direction, Maxwell walked along a towering crystalized salt wall where the sea-side shops used to be.  As Maxwell roamed through the town, something peculiar caught his attention, there was an old man seated on a wooden bench, facing the grey ocean as storms brewed and rolled onto the shore.  The old man had a large porous nose and wore a twine colored jacket along with a golfers-green walrus cap.   Hey you! he shouted in a hoarse voice. What are you doing here! Maxwell was startled and hid with his back against the cold salt wall.  Get out of there, kid! Maxwell came out from behind the wall about to run back home but before he could the old man said,  Hey, dont run! Come over here and take a seat. Dont worry, I don't bite. The old man schootched over as Maxwell sat on the far end of the wooden bench. They both faced the roaring ocean.  You see that? The old man said as he pointed at the broad sea. Thats the enemy. What do you mean? Maxwell asked, unsure of what he was pointing at. That! The great ocean. Thats the enemy! The old man exclaimed again.  I dont understand what you mean, mister. The old man paused and then asked, You go to school, kid?  Yeah. Well, I used to, before the storm. Hmm, you do look familiar he said as he scratched his grey beard.  Listen, If I were you, kid, I would forget everything youve ever learned. You see, school doesnt teach a thing. That ocean, pointing once again at the vast open sea thats where you learn your lessons. The ocean? Bingo! Yes, that's her name. That tumultuous beast. The ocean will teach you everything youll ever need. Life, death, love, and hatred, its all in there. If you stare long enough, like me,  shell eventually gaze back. Why are you here? Maxwell abruptly asked.  Im doing what youre doing, kid, dreaming. You know us old folk still dream too, well, some of us. As Yeats once said, The old man licked and smacked his lips,   So dont you tread on my dreams! Theyre all Ive got left. The old man cocked his head back looking at the grey clouds above.  Do you know when the storm will end? Maxwell asked.  The old man continued to look up Hmmm he thought. Well, the storm never does end, does it? It just keeps rolling in. Itll never stop. And if you think it stopped, just know, theres an even bigger storm somewhere far away, getting larger and larger, and when you thought everything was all good and sunshine, there it will be, ready to wash over everything you love. So the storm will never end? Yeah, but dont worry about it. By the way, whats your name kid? Maxwell. Well Max, call me Charles. You know you ask a lot of questions. Thats good, real good. But dont expect everyone you ask questions to have the answers. Maxwell and Charles watched as massive clouds formed along the horizon, slowly making their way to the shore.  Do you have a plan? Maxwell said, breaking the silence. A plan?, Charles cackled. Forget plans Max, plans dont get you anywhere. Understand? Plans just get in the way. I used to have a plan, me and my wife, a splendid plan but guess what? Lifes got a plan of her own, and if yours dont match hers, they're as good as toilet paper. Does your wife join your dreams? She used to."" Charles paused. ""She and I would share all our dreams. We took our dreams as guides through the world, to hell with plans. Now shes in a dream of her own, and Ill surely be joining soon. My sister is in a dream of her own too. Is that so? Charles asked, turning in Maxwell's direction for the first time since they began speaking.  Yeah, she dreams all day. I wish I could join because shes always smiling when shes dreaming, I dont remember her smiling that much before, so whatever shes dreaming about must be nice. The old man smiled and laughed.  Whats so funny? Everythings funny! Lifes one big long joke and were all just waiting for the punchline. The distant sea became less clear and Maxwell rubbed his eyes.  So what should I do if the storm never ends? Maxwell asked.  Thats a good question!, Charles said and then continued.  Well, it can stop, in a sense. I thought you said it never stops? I say a lot of things, doesnt mean Im right. But it all depends on what youre looking at. If you look for rain, rain will look for you. If you spend your life just trying to float by then the storm does indeed never end. You know, I dont remember a day of bad weather when me and Missy were together. Even if it was pouring cats and dogs, all I ever saw was her. What do you mean? Maxwell was beginning to doze off, struggling to listen as Charles talked.  Well, when you love something or someone, thats all you see. You see? The storm still does its thing but it doesnt matter, what you love matters. Maxwell imagined the things he loved: playing with his friends, snow cones during winter, afternoons on the boat.  Thats not love, Max! Those are things you like. See, you dont always love what you like, and you don't always like what you love. You can only love one thing at a time, no exceptions to the rule. The old man continued.  When you love something, everything else disappears. Even the idea of love. The man in love is as good as blind, he doesnt know up from down, he doesnt know a thing. In the same way he doesnt even realize theres a storm. See what I mean? I think so. Maxwell said as the old man began to fade away. Maxwell could feel himself slipping from the lucid dream, his eyelids peeled back and revealed the stars plastered against his bedroom ceiling. A ray of light shined against Maxwell's face and he turned to see the storm had vanished. He saw clearly through his window. A sunny day, things were back to the way they were before.  His home was no longer filled with plants and creatures. Daisy was well awake and seated at the breakfast table with their mother and father. Rise and shine sleepy head! Lily said with an endearing smile, serving him a big plate of pancakes. Eat up, the bus will be here at any time. Maxwell quickly ate and rushed outside. Seafarer was bright and lively. The sky was cloudless, the ocean was rolled in with soft waves. He walked along to the bus stop and a sharp yellow bus pulled up beside the curb.  The bus doors folded and as Maxwell walked up the steps he was greeted by a familiar rusty voice.  Hello Max! Ready for school?  Maxwell looked up amazed to see the old man in the same golf-green walrus cap."
Tasha and her Mum,"Tasha is Raised by a single mum in a lovely Cabin. Shes average height, very beautiful, and just turned 18. Wake up and see beautiful trees as she opens the window and look up the sky sad, like shed no reason living. Made the bed, clean the house, prepare breakfast, took a bath before she wakes up her mum and walk her to the living room. She was a good girl, her mum was proud. Pick up her bag and hug her mum so tight as she gets off for school as if she doesnt want to let go. This was her daily routine. Her Mum had been suffering from an illness over the years. She was an accountant, intelligent, and a top student of her class with a 3.7GPA. She was timid, although having a lot of friends. She was sad in school most of the times. When friends ask about it, shell say I dont want to border you guys with my problems. Shed no boyfriend, she pushes them away every time. She was so tired of worrying about her mum because her mum had been ill since she was just 10. Some days at school, shell rush to the toilet and cry asking God to show her a sign or something she can hold onto thatll give her strength to keep living. On Tuesday, classes where over and Tasha is coming back from school, swinging the two arms with anxious to see her mum when she show up home. As she draws near, her uncle was standing just outside the main door. He looked worried. With quick instincts, she shouts out 'mummy' racing into the house just to see her mum stiff on the bed struggling to breed. Her uncle had called for the ambulance and was waiting outside.Tasha dropped her bag and followed her dying Mum to the hospital, where they put her on oxygen and the doctor attended to her. She underwent x-ray and the illness had gotten worst. Tasha is by her side, twirling her hair and watch her struggle with life until finally gave up the ghost after three days in the hospital. She knew this day will come, but she couldnt help it but shed tears. After her mums funeral, she got home and In tears, she coincidentally found her room. Locked the door hard. Get down on the carpet and incline toward the bed edge. Listening to the birds sing and the breeze blow across the window, she felt like the world is crumbling. She was depressed, lonely, and lost. She locked herself up for days and didnt border about classes. Her instructors connected with her since her GPA was slipping. She Dropped out and all expectation was no more. Her uncle requested to come and lament at his place so he could watch after her. She said I need to be left alone . She could barely even eat and was getting thinner. One sunny day she took a walk down to a bridge, shouting for all to hear asking God to give her a sign to continue to live. Tom her friend at school saw her on his way from hiking. It was a weekend. He saw her crying. They told him what had happened. He came and comforted her, asking her to stop crying. And reassured her that any where her mum is right now shes happy and shell want you to move on with your life, get back to school; get good grades, get a good job, and make her proud. She smiled with tears rolling down from her eyes and told him she was not emotionally and psychologically ready to get back to school. Tom advised her to go slowly and that God will give her an indication when she's prepared. She was a little relieved when Tom said because ever since her mum got sick she always ask God to show her a sign that Hes up in heaven looking after her. She hugged Tom like the way she used to hug her mum, thanking him for caring. Tom then walk her back home and told her they were writing exams in two weeks as he rides his bike off. Tasha is now home alone. She went upstairs to her mums room and saw mums photos lying down at the corner. She picked them up, admiring them, and placed them on her chest as though shes embracing it. She folded her mums dresses and put them in boxes, also shoes. Get these boxes outside leaving only a photo that she took with her Mum. She had to burn all of them because she cries every time she sees her mums stuffs.Her phone rings and is Tom on the phone. She picks it up and he asked how shes doing and then ask her if they could go and take a walk, Tasha gladly accepted. They went out into the woods, talked, make jokes, and laughed. Tom is happy to see her smile. He inquired as to whether she is all set back to class. She sighs bowing down her head and he advised her not to stress that he will help her breezed through her approaching coming semester tests. Tasha asked Tom why he was so kind to her and he told her I had been nice to you ever since remember?, but you are always the one that pushes me away every time. And went on to say tell her he didnt want to meddle. Tasha told him she was going through a lot in her life and was so depressed that she could not talk to anybody. Tom told her that he will be there for her anytime that she needs him. They hugged and held hands as they came back. Tasha is on the bed and continue to picture the minutes she had with Tom in the forested areas, how delicate and cherishing he was. She was falling head over heels for him. Tom and Tasha started dating and somehow theres hope. Tom helped her study for the exams, she was smart. She went to her Mums grave to tell her that shes going in for the semester exams and asked if she was happy where she is, also she told her shes getting married to Tom on her graduation day if she passed. Tom had proposed to her and she accepted. Tasha wrote the exams successfully with Tom. The results came out and they passed, graduated, and got married. They later got Jobs and Tasha went to church to thank God for sending Tom to her. And she visited her mums grave on her birthday, to give her flowers. Tom and Tasha lived happily."
Gabriel : Guardian of the Galactic,"On 11 November, Eleven minutes after the clock tower on the church of the Galactic struck eleven times, I could feel the vibration. Deaf I was, but not blind to see the saw-edged lightening fall near my mom and dad in the far distance. They flew apart into the sky, as if they had wings of an angel. I watched in amazement. Galactic was torn into bits, luckily our mansion had no scratch.Gabriel! shouted my grandma and grandpa in unison. My old grandmahastenedup to me and held my hands tight as if she did not want me to go the heavens with the angels. The bloody silver flash on our silver painted mansion, made it invisible for few seconds. I am 22 years old today, and was only 11, when I saw the miraculous fall of light and last sight of my beloved parents. They taught me the language of sign but selfish they were to leave behind me and my six brothers. I was the oldest of all. One day I was gazing at the blue moon, my first brother Uriel came to me and said, I cant see anything than recurring twos, he saidSee the time now is 22:22, On the twenty second of February. Is there anything superstitious, Uriel asked.I quiet simply rubbed it off to be acoincidence.He then went on saying, wherever I go, whatever I see I, the number two hallucinates me like hooks all over.Next day, my third brother Raphael alsouttered to me that he had illusions of figure three were disturbing his mind. For sure He did not know, what had transpired between me and Uriel. I went to my grandma, who do believe there is god in the heavens. She said, Gabriel, spirits do exist, the good rays eats up the bad ones.Have you heard about the fallen angels? How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! Once a beautiful angel named Lucifer who defied God and fell from grace.she could tell this to me, just by using her hands and her beautiful face. I wondered if Selaphiels head was raining fours. He was an introvert. I was nervous, as I slowly walked to him. He signalled, with both his hands for asking me what happened to me. Thanks, he looked, alright. I kept seeing elevens allover.In the edges of buildings, walls, windows; any squarish, rectangular shaped object only showed itself to me as 11:11. My mind wasblaring, my eyes dimming, I felt very weak. As the dusk closed in,Selaphiellooked into his digital watch and asked me, brother its 4:44 and should we go for a stroll. I replied, most certainly, we should. As we both went into the woods, we firstly saw four children playing, then four birds returning to their nests, four boatmen lazily moving their hands on the oars. He did talk about all of them but didnt interpret what I did. I could feel each artery carrying blood in double speed. If I closed my eyes the darkness got overshadowed with sparkling light like falling stars and then suddenly, it all disappeared like magic. As We walked back, children were playing on the swings. Ihallucinated the two swings tied to the branches of the trees as 11:11. I asked Selapheil by pointing towards the same, what do you see up there? He showed me four fingers with the thumb pressed in, waved it downwards, he saw four ropes swinging to and fro.For a moment, I was perplexed, my heart almost stopped, I closed my eyes in astonishment. Our parents were god-sent, they taught us to be brave.From my mother, I learnt compassion, she was a graceful, always wished our good,admired us. The happiness we possessed was all taken away by the wicked evils on the dreadful day. Before bed we all prayed to the holy Jesus to keep them in heavens, far from where the spirits of hell could breach. Everyday In my sleep, I cry, rememberingthem.With thedyslectic state of mind, the numbers were throwing in all directions. I finally slept. The sun rays pierced into my room, the heat inside the quilt woke me to see Raguel, my fourth brother who had nightmare with five angels from the heaven, fighting with another five devils of the hell. He wasdiscomfited and heclamorouslyshouted that  We are surrounded bysupernatural powers, It is impossible that we will not be slayed by the witches. Instantly, I embraced him and put him to ease, said Brother, do not get perturbed with such annoying dreams. Will figure out something at the soonest. After all this, my grandpa confided in me one secret.He tremor-ed badly as he always did, while signaling to me that every fortnight my parents came in his dream. They were flanked by two angels who bring them to the earth from the gateway of the heaven. But yesterday, my father revealed that they have been possessed by some unnatural beings the evil ones, and foiling all there attempts to unite with the family, in a whisker they vanished in thin air. I did not know what to say, was happy to hear the contentious but rather improbable truth of union with my parents.Incessant attempts of exorcism by ordained priest through reciting endless prayers using sacramentals and relics went on for few days and weeks. But for no relief. On the sixth of June,Barachiel also had his spell of the illusive figurines turning into number six, since he pre-empted this, the misery was to some extent reversed. We all started believing that our parents did not die, but were missing. It is quite possible that they could have been thrown away by the lightening on that awful day. To the North of our farmland, there existed a deep gorge beneath which, riverflowed furiously. No human had ventured on the other side of the river.Barachiel, also suggested me that the number eleven also meant the parallel line showing northwards, we must carryout our search in that direction. Meanwhile, the satanic priests from the Church told us another shocking news. He said that one of our family member will die in this risky venture. Our footprints extended to the territory close to the deep gorges to the South, still we were unable to cross the river. Finally, on the 07 of July Michael tried to dodge the number seven from his head. He seemed to have been possessed by demons. All attempts to dispossess the physical manifestation failed. Michaels health started deteriorating, on the tenth of November, he took his last breath. He probably died of dehydration and undernourishment. The despair and the feeling of hope died with Michael, my youngest and sweetest brother. While the adventure of crossingwas going no where but to the dead end of Michaels departure. It was first death anniversary of my parents tomorrow. All of us, less Michael and my parents, who we thought were in the heavens were grieving for them, We had planned prayers at the church. We saw another melancholic dawn of 11 Nov, We all walked to the church together, As usual the clock tower struck eleven. While the chrurchgate was at stone-throwing distance from our mansion, carrying my gradma and grandpa to the prayer hall took us time. While we walked the path Michaels pain reverberated through our minds. We reached the church gate, I turned my left arm to see the time, it was 11:11. I raised my head towards the centre piece the Holy Jesus, from the altar, through the halo, we saw my parents approaching towards us."
My Childhood,"I would always love to talk about my childhood. Even though my most admired friend who is a soldier, he always tells me that I should always keep looking forward instead of backward, because according to his experience, people who are stuck in the past gets PTSD and some other mental health problems. His optimistic soldier mind tells him that, the only direction in life is forward. But I still want to talk a little bit about my childhood. I was born in a small village in China, which is a socialist country with a big land and many subdivisions and provinces. People in China gave me an impression of being not organized and selfish, because they dont usually trust the government and they thought they are very corrupted. Well, I dont deny it as the government at that time was really incompetent and couldnt seem to promise a better life for its people. Anyway, I was the third child in the family, the last one, so I got all the attention and love from my parents better than my two older brothers. Unfortunately, I was born a monkey in our Chinese traditional zodiac, so I was destined to be naughty, disobedient and willful. I often blamed that I am not smart it is probably because my nanny dropped me from the second floor by accident when I was just three months old. I got a big red bruise on my forehead and until today, I am still not sure what consequence of that could possibly be. Am I supposed to be smarter? I could never know. My parents were always busy during my childhood, they often worked from 7am to 11pm everyday until the end of the year when we could finally have a holiday to go exploring the other part of the country. We had been to most provinces of China and I had a lot of extraordinary memories that my peers dont have like seeing snow and riding horses on the prairies. I love traveling and I love playing with the native people. Unfortunately, I have a very willful and irresponsible eldest brother who always liked messing around with girls and disliked everything that parents gave him. He often complaint about everything and he never looked happy. The only good thing about him is that, he often bought a lot of toys that he liked such as high-tech stuffs and graphic books, which I could just took them and enjoyed without spending my own pocket money on any of these stuffs. I didnt have a lot of pocket money, and I saved each cent I got from my relative, but he somehow made me so rich because of his careless and impulsive buying. I am a perfectionist, I often think that I didnt have a very complete childhood because of my parents absence for work. They were often talking to their clients and always working. I sometime feel sad because my mom was not hugging and kissing me like other mothers did to their kids. However, she showed her love by giving me a lot of books to read, taking me to the bookstore and buy me dictionaries, and she also gave me a lot of freedom in choosing my electives in studying. Now I could draw, dance, piano and violin, sing, chess and many other hobbies because of her. I love everything she gave me but I just still feel like all I didnt have enough is love. If I could have more love, all my creation and compositions would have been masterpieces and displayed in the museum. During my childhood, my parents didnt actually expect me to become someone else, but set me wild in the nature and made me figure out how to deal with life. Sounding kind of irresponsible and I can tell you, this was scary. I could only pray to God when I met a human trafficker and trying to abduct a child for money, not to mention my parents were too busy to teach me about the existence of God. I learned about God all by myself but since I didnt really surrender to him until I was an adult, I made so many mistakes and committed so many sins I could have avoided, such as not appreciating life and all the good things that people gave me. Gratitude had always been missing in my miserable young life and I am still feeling very guilty about it. After elementary school, I was sent to a boarding school where all the bullies happened. I was able to going back home for the weekend, but you know, a good half of my children was spent without my parents company and now I was separated from them once again to a boarding school that was so far away from my hometown. I sometimes felt unfortunate for myself for having such irresponsible parents, but then I realized this was an expensive private school and my parents worked so much just to send me here, I studied real hard to become one of the top students in the school. I didnt have social life and thought I did the right thing to study hard. I thought I was being smart, but now I am an adult, I felt regret didnt enjoy my childhood like the other children did, like taking things slow and enjoy my life in the environment, treasure whatever I had and loved my life. Anyway, I didnt have a lot of good memories in the boarding school but many A plus on my transcripts. After all these messes, I immigrated to Canada with my family, who didnt even know how to speak English. I was told that my parents were the first family in our last name to go oversea and became immigrants. I was kind of reluctant to go abroad but now I am in love with Canada, as I didnt actually engage with Chinese people during the childhood as I was always reading and waiting for the yelling and teaching from my strict parents. In Canada I met my love, and we had a great time together. He made me feel that, this world is so beautiful because of him. All things happened in my past are so insignificant because he is my beautiful future.Thank you for your time reading this, I often feel relieved after talking about my traumas and pains in the past, and thank you for giving everyone an opportunity to express their ideas through this platform. Thank you."
The Kimoya Beads,"The air was stifling as Charles rummaged through dusty boxes in the attic. As he came across various pictures and baby toys, he was filled with nostalgia even though he was sent by his wife to get rid of everything. He came across a smaller box with his name imprinted on it. Glancing inside, his heart warmed as he beheld the kimoya beads. Taking the bracelet into his hands he reminisced the scent of his mother whod given it to him at birth. He placed it in his pocket and continued his cleaning. Exhausted from his days work, Charles hardly heard his wife say, Good night, as he drifted asleep. In an instant, the smell of pancakes wafted past his nostrils perking his senses. He followed the smell, just as hed done numerous times when he was younger. Standing in the doorframe of the kitchen, he watched as his mother flipped the pancakes one by one. Sweat gleamed on her creased brow, and her apron was dusted with flour. The side of her mouth was quirked as she moved her hips to the music playing in her head. Jr, she called. He smiled and stepped into the room. Just before he was about to speak, a young kid in striped pajamas rushed past him scrambling to sit in the high chair at the kitchen table. The boy looked to be about four, but there was something alarming about him. Good morning, mama, the boy said.  He looked closer at the child sitting in his chair.  Charles mouth dropped as he took himself in, taking note of the kimoya beads around the childs tiny wrist. He watched as Jr was served pancakes, and observed the other two empty places at the table. Daddy, your foods gonna get cold, Mama shouted. A man with rich, dark skin sauntered into the kitchen. The man was young, maybe no older than he himself, but his belly was round as if the tastes of age were beginning to take its form. His beard was lightly flecked with gray, but his glasses remained high upon his face. His posture was still straight, his gait still smooth. He kissed Jrs head, and blew a kiss to his wife. Charles stood and watched as the events unfolded, unsure if he should intervene. He wasnt even sure if they knew he was there. Ma? Charles said, taking a step further into the kitchen. No response. Mama? He said again and she looked up instantly towards the little boy at the table. Jr, did you call me? Jrs big, bright eyes looked up, his mouth filled with food. Oh. nevermind, she smiled going back to her morning routine. Charles backed out of the kitchen. One foot after the other, then he turned around and ran. He ran for the front door and slammed it closed behind him. Hands on his knees, he gasped for air in the stifling heat. He couldnt quite place his emotions nor could he make sense of what was happening. Gathering himself, he stood straight. Just as he took his last deep breath and was about to go back inside, he felt a slight shift in the air. It wasnt smothering hot, but there was a nice breeze like the breezes that come with Fall. He glanced around the neighborhood and smiled. He could almost feel as if he were reliving his childhood. He remembered running on these sidewalks, and playing in the water sprinklers. He remembered failing at riding his skateboard, and-. His breath caught as he watched his ten year old self ride a bike down the street. The orange, short sleeved button down shirt and jean shorts, he remembered this day like it was yesterday. Instantly, Charles took after his younger self desperate to stop what was bound to define him for years to come. With a cramp in his side, weakened legs, and strained lungs, hed finally arrived at the playground. It was really a small play area in the neighborhood, but it felt huge to him when he was little. Just as expected his bike was parked behind the only tree in the park, and Jr sat on the only bench. Jr watched the kids laughing and playing.  Both Charles and Jr thought simultaneously. He felt a tiny jolt within him, and he looked at the little boy on the bench who was also looking up at him. For a moment it seemed as if the boy could actually see him, but before he could ask something stole Jrs attention, and he knew exactly what it was. A group of boys, all small in size compared to Jr, were fighting over whod get to ride Jrs bike first. . Hey! Jr yelled, Thats my bike! Jr ran over, and Charles was not far behind. Jr, stay away from them, he tried to tell him, but Jr couldnt hear him. The kids trying to steal Jrs bike were from his school. They often terrorized him, so it was no coincidence that they were here now. Oh Jr, hi, the leader of the group, a ginger, said. We didnt know that this was your bike, he lied. Charles could feel the absolute fear seeping from Jrs pores. Thats ok, Jr responded, but can you leave it alone? You wouldnt mind if we rode it around the park, would you? The ginger asked. Jr became anxious. Another one of the boys from the group, a blondie, pushed him hard saying, Yea Jr, let us ride. Fed up, Jr pushed the ginger off of his bike causing him to fall to the ground and tackled the blondie. The two scuffled, Jr getting the best of him, until the other three kids jumped in each taking turns to punch, kick, and slap Jr. The beating felt as if it took a lifetime to end, but when they were finally worn out the kids stole his bike and left him bleeding on the ground. The sun was near setting, the air getting cooler. Charles remembered the pain all too well. He suddenly noticed the bracelet in his pocket and took it out. He moved it about in his hands, and he cried with Jr. Just as before when theyd both had the same thought, there was a tiny jolt within him. Charles immediately looked at the little boy who was laying on the ground looking up at him. The air went still as the two stared at each other. Realizing hed been holding his breath, he released it. Jr looked down into Charles hands, a spark of recognition lighting his eyes. Charles walked up to him carefully, like a cheetah stalking its prey. He came to his knees, and Jr sat up. Looking into each others eyes, he placed the bracelet onto Jrs wrist. The boy then stood up with his back straight and his jaw strong. After a single deep breath, Jr turned and walked away. He watched as Jr confidently walked home. When he was out of sight, Charles looked down at his hands. He was ashamed that hed allowed this moment to define him. He closed his eyes for a second, but when he opened them he was somewhere else. The overwhelming smell of flowers and the freakishly long line of cars reassured him of where he was. It was move-in day, and he was a huge mess of emotions. He looked around until he found his younger self, eighteen year old Jr beginning his freshman year of college. His mother, now older and streaked with gray, held Jrs face. Tears streaming down her wrinkled face, she kissed his forehead deeply. His dad literally had to pry her off of him, so that he too could kiss his son bye. Do big things, he told him.  Charles and Jr thought together.Again there was that tiny jolt, and Charles found his younger self staring at him. After a second, though, Jr was distracted by his departing parents. Jr was strong until theyd left. He remembered how terrified he was of wasting his entire college experience. He followed Jr into his dorm, and when he closed the door behind him, he was startled to turn and find that the scene had changed. Twenty-one year old Jr, sat on the edge of his bed with a girl sitting next to him. They appeared to be having a serious conversation, one that Charles slowly began to remember. Her name was Sierra, and she was pretty. Her figure was slim, and her hair was in long, auburn braids. Her lashes were long and her cheek bones were high. He adored her. Look, Jr, She said, I dont know whats going on with you, but I think you need time to figure it out on your own. He remembered that feeling of panic as he knew he was going to lose her. Jr looked at her unsure of what to say. Even up until then, hed had trouble with accepting himself, his self-esteem utterly low. He knew that she cared, but he was wary that his feelings for her werent being matched. Consumed with the belief that he was never good enough, Jr pushed everyone away. She took his face into her hands, and she kissed him deeply. Keep your head up, she said and walked out of the room. Jr looked down at his feet. they thought together. With that tingling jolt, Jrs head snapped up, and Charles shot to attention. They watched each other, Jrs head tilting to the side with curiosity as he beheld the bracelet on his hand. Charles was taken aback, for he didnt realize that it was there, but he took off the beads and handed it to Jr. Jr turned them over in his hands, a small smile dancing across his wide lips. Mama had passed away by this time, but Jr looked up and winked. Charles heard loud cheering outside of the dorm. He went to see what it was as Jr watched him leave. It was very bright compared to Jrs dimly lit room. Giving his eyes a moment to focus, he heard the announcement. Thank you all for coming out to congratulate our class of 2020. He sucked in a breath as he took in the huge crowd of people who cheered as they surged to their feet. Smiling from ear to ear, Jr too cheered from his place behind the podium. Charles rushed to the front of the crowd to find himself. His father and younger brother rose from their seats as Jr came running down the stage stairs. They hugged him tightly, uttering words of praise and adoration. Peeking out from the sleeve of his graduation gown, Charles saw the kimoya beads around Jrs wrist. He was a little surprised, for he didnt remember wearing them that day. However, when Jr looked up and smiled at him, he was certain that he hadnt. He couldnt help but smile back. Charles eyes shot open as dawns light peered through his bedroom window. His breathing quickened as he took in his surroundings, trying to make note of what was real. He looked next to him and found his wife sleeping peacefully next to him. He eased back into bed facing her and relaxed as he admired her physique, her soft coils peeking out from beneath her bonnet. He wrapped an arm around her, savoring the warmth. He closed his eyes and was filled with so much gratitude. Hed been through a lot, and his mother had gone before her time. However, when he was just a toddler shed already taught him everything he needed to succeed. Feeling something in his pants pocket, he reached and found the kimoya beads. He released a breath, and tears threatened to form. You okay, baby? His wife asked. He looked and found her gazing at him. He wrapped his arms around her again. I love you, was all hed said. After a moment, their door burst open. Good morning! Their three children yelled as they climbed onto the bed, the youngest of the three (his baby girl) needing assistance. Well good morning, he responded as his wife laughed. His two boys snuggled against their mama, as his daughter did to him. Dada, whats that? She asked, pointing to the bracelet he held in his hands. Oh this? This is my superhero beads. When I put them on my wrist like this, I get mad strength. But not strength in here, he said flexing his arms, but strength in here, he touched her temples. When I wear this, I feel I can do anything no matter how hard. Here try it on. Charles put the bracelet on her tiny arm. See dont you feel it? He asked knowing shed say yes. Uhuh, she smiled big. You know what, you can have it. She smiled with her snagged teeth, and laid next to him. Together the family went back to sleep, and this time he hoped without any dreams."
Faithless Pets,"There once lived cheerfully together, in a fine house, a turtle shell Cat and a lovely white Dog: the Cat's name was Tittums; the Dog's, Fido. In course of time the beautiful Dog fell head over heels for the Cat, and just hung tight for a decent opportunity to reveal his expressions of warmth. This came one day, when Tittums had put her paws on the bumper, dropped her head a little on one side, half shut her eyes, and appeared considering nothing by any stretch of the imagination. Then, at that point Fido, who lay extended at full length upon the hearth-mat, taken a gander at her, and hurling a delicate cry, said,""Gracious, Tittums, I've experienced passionate feelings for!"" ""In fact!"" answered the reasonable Cat, not wishing to show him how restless she was. ""Indeed, in fact,"" proceeded with the little Doggy, fairly hurt at her briskness: ""It's you that I've experienced passionate feelings for. Do you like me, Tittums?"" However, Tittums would not reply, even with a solitary murmur r! furthermore, it was uniquely upon her giving him a wily post of the side of her left eye that he thought about the amount she loved him. Notwithstanding, made intense by even this little badge of regard, he came unobtrusively up, and sat close by; going up until now, finally, as to take her out for a short stroll down the nursery way, where they glanced through the railings at individuals cruising by. ""Well,"" said Fido to himself, ""I have no uncertainty except for she will cherish me on schedule; all the more, as I have incredible any expectations of becoming greater before the spring."" Yet, one morning, when Tittums rolled in from a visit she had been paying her mamma, she was trailed by a man of his word from the jungles, who, with all insolence, made himself comfortable, squeezed Tittums' paw to his heart, called her ""the loveliest of Cats,"" requested that she oblige him with a melody, which he had been told she could sing pleasantly, and never took minimal notification of poor Fido, who was sitting in the corner. To come clean, poor Fido was extremely cross, and started to snarl viciously; the more so when, regrettably, he viewed the delight with which Tittums heard this drivel. He was unable to think what right the striking outsider needed to come there unasked; for all that he had radiant red and green plumes, a dapper, expansive overflowed cap, and a gold-headed strolling stick, he was not gorgeous, that was extremely sure. However, Tittums was particularly struck by his appearance and bearing; his plumes were so lovely, he communicated in such countless dialects, yelled so horrendously and in an uproarious voice, had voyaged so a lot, and was so struck by the magnificence of Tittums, that, helpless little Cat as she was, she stopped to really focus a catch on reliable Fido, and saved all her tricky looks for Mr. Paul Parrot. ""Exquisite Tittums,"" said Mr. Paul, ""you should fail to remember such upstart little dogs as Fido. Pay attention to meI am an explorerI communicate in five dialects, I have a royal residence made of brilliant bars, inside which is a roost fit for a lord, I have a benefits of bread and milk and Barcelona nuts: all of which I will impart to you. To-morrow we will go for an outing into the field close to the house. Great by for the present, my dear Pussy Cat;"" and he disappeared kissing his hand. Poor Fido cried. Insidious Tittums! As day followed day, Miss Puss ignored her little Dog to an ever increasing extent. She left with Mr. Paul Parrot, she sang to him, taken a gander at him, and, indeed, possibly appeared to be content when he was by. Poor Fido was consistent with his first love, albeit nearly brought to surrender; he got exceptionally slim without a doubt, and his fine thick coat, which he had kept quite perfect, became battered and filthy. Undoubtedly, Mr. Parrot conveyed all before him; he was so amazing, so cherishing, thus smart, that Fido from being abandoned became disdained. One evening, soon after dull, as he was wandering about, feeling extremely pitiful, and believing that, maybe, it is smarter to flee, he at the same time wound up in the following nursery, and keeping in mind that he was looking round him, he heard voices. ""Exquisite Mrs. Daw,"" said one of the voices which he appeared to remember, ""I'm an explorerI communicate in five dialectsI have a castle made of brilliant bars, inside which is a roost fit for a ruler, I have a benefits of bread and milk and nuts; all of which I will impart to you. To-morrow we will fly for an outing on to the extraordinary oak-tree in Farmer Hodges' field."" ""Dear me!"" thought Fido, ""this should be Mr. Parrot."" And, adequately sure, so it was, Mr. Parrot, for sure, and making the hottest of adoration to old Mrs. Daw, the widow of Miser Jack Daw, who, during a long life, and through taking and saving, had laid by an enormous fortune, which he had left Mrs. Daw to appreciate. The old widow appeared to be particularly satisfied at the glow of Mr. Paul's adoration, and almost certainly felt that each word he said was valid; scoffing round at him with her old eyes, and wishing that she had put on a spotless muslin cap, as it may have made her look much more youthful than she suspected she did. Concerning Fido, he nearly hopped for euphoria; he ran home in a hurry. ""Goodness, Tittums!"" said he, inconsiderate of her derisive looks, ""what do you think I have discovered? There is that scalawag of a Paul Parrot, who imagines such a lot of adoration for you, seeking Widow Daw at the present time; and in the event that you come without a moment's delay you may see it with your own eyes."" ""Gibberish!"" answered Tittums: ""I don't trust it."" ""Well,"" said the Dog, ""to persuade you, on the off chance that you will just go to the opposite side of the divider you will see that what I have said is very obvious."" Yet, Pussy, confiding in the honor of Mr. Paul, would not accept a word, and it was solely after a lot of influence that she was instigated to hop over the divider and tune in. Mr. Paul and Mrs. Daw were all the while pursuing, and the Parrot was attempting, by persuading the old woman, to discover the amount she was worth, and where every one of her fortunes were covered up. Undoubtedly Mrs. Daw was simply about to start disclosing to him her mysterious, when Tittums, incapable to contain herself, hurried at Mr. Paul and scratched his face. ""Goodness, you terrible Parrot!"" she said; ""did you not vow to wed me, and take me to your brilliant royal residence?"" ""Brilliant royal residence!"" shouted Mrs. Daw: ""why, you devilish bird, that is the thing that you guaranteed me. Stay, ma'am, what did he say other than? did he guarantee you any bread and milk, or any Barcelona nuts?"" ""Indeed, he didhe didhe did,"" proceeded with the Cat, scratching and pawing the bogus, fickle Parrot as she talked. ""Well,"" said Pussy, presently genuinely depleted, ""I trust you are fulfilled: if at any point you draw close to our home once more, I'll fix each quill you have on your back;"" thus she left him, taking Fido with her, who, disregarding his overall amicableness and the Parrot's fury, couldn't avoid giving him a few sharp chomps. When Mrs. Daw was left alone with Paul, she started to chide him with his erroneousness, ""You indecent, stood up, monstrous, off-kilter double crosser! you have neither trustworthiness enough to live by, nor wings enough to fly with."" Whereupon she seized him and gave him such a culling as spoilt his attractive features. Never after this was the Parrot ready to hold up his head. Each one disdained him; even his brilliant royal residence ended up being a metal confine; and for his offenses a chain was attached round his leg. He was restricted to a wooden roost, which, out of unadulterated disdain, he was continually pecking. Old Widow Daw stayed discreet, and stayed unmarried. Tittums couldn't resist the urge to respect the consistency of Fido; and when in the spring he had become greater, and was elevated to a sweet red and dark collar, Pussy found that she adored him especially for sure, and decided never more to neglect him."
Summer of 96',"I remember it like it was yesterday.. It was the summer of 96', I had just finished playing baseball with some friends, and I was on my way home to get ready for a family outing. My white Chuck Taylors turned grey as I stirred up dust on that old gravel road. I could feel each rock through my shoes as I stepped on them, I might as well have been barefoot.. I was a teenager at the time, about fourteen I'd say, so the mile walk from my friend's house back to my own wasn't exactly a challenge, but still I had to stop for a minute, to give my aching soles a rest, those shoes never did my feet any favors, but they were my favorite pair so I wore them everywhere, even to church on Sundays.I sat there on the side of the road, listening to the birds, watching squirrels scurry about, foraging. Then something caught my eye, a tuft of orange fur sat on a fallen, rotting tree. It was a cat, except.. It wasn't.. Everything about it was cat-like, all but its face.. The first thing I noticed was its nose.. The bridge was long, its nostrils were flared, and wide, it looked human.. So did its thin lips, curled into a haunting smile.. Its unblinking eyes were dark brown, I could see its soul through them, and I was sure it could see mine..It was a hot, humid day, but I remember shivering, goosebumps covered my arms, the hairs on the back of my neck rose, and my breathing halted. I tried getting to my feet, but my legs wouldn't work, if I could have stood my knees would have probably buckled beneath me.. I just sat there, staring at the creature, and it stared back, still, and silent..I think it sensed my unease, its smile grew larger, the corners of its mouth disappeared, and the tips of its jagged yellow teeth protruded ever so slightly from its lips..It stood up, arched its back, and drug its claws along the dead tree, scraping off bark, digging out maggots.. It let out a long, deep yawn, it sounded like a woman's.. The noise threw me into a terror-fueled panic, but I still couldn't stand, I couldn't run, the best I could do was slowly, clumsily, crawl backwards into the woods on the opposite side of that gravel road..It sat back down, and began licking its paws without breaking eye contact. The scraping of each lick had the same effect as nails on a chalkboard, I winced at each stroke of the cat's tongue, why was it so loud?I didn't have a cellphone at the time, so I couldn't capture evidence of what I was seeing, if I had a camera I'm not sure I would have been able to hold it steady enough to get a picture anyway..It stopped its licking, pursed its lips together, and whistled loudly.. It sounded just like a bird call.. It crouched down in its hunter's pose, and waited patiently. Sure enough a curious bluejay landed beside the cat, but it didn't see it, it had no idea how close it was standing to its own doom.. It tried to fly away at the last second, but it was too late.. The cat opened its mouth, and revealed rows of short yellow fangs, its jaws gaped open so wide it could have swallowed the bird whole.. It pounced, and tore the poor bluejay clean in half. It gnawed at the bottom half loudly, cracking the thin bones, while the top half flopped around for a moment in a puddle of its own blood..I had cats of my own, so there were plenty of times I had witnessed their carnivorous handiwork, but it was never so gruesome, so.. upsetting. My stomach turned at the sight, and I threw up my lunch in the leaves. I wanted to get away from whatever the hell it was that I was witnessing, but I was frozen in place, and I was too afraid to close my eyes.. I just sat there, forced to witness the bird's carcass be devoured, I still remember the sound of it, like twigs crackling in a fire..When it finally finished it began licking the blood from its paws, not quite purring, it was more like someone humming in delight after filling their belly with fast food.. it might as well have been dancing.. The blood soaked into the rotting tree bark, staining it crimson, and the cat lapped up what remained of it..It smiled at me again, blood matted on the fur around its lips, the sun bouncing off of its wide brown eyes, it was still humming a tune, and it almost sounded familiar.. If I wasn't already dehydrated from the heat I probably would have been pissing myself..The cat curled up on the blood-stained bark, closed its eyes, and in a soft, soothing voice it spoke: ""You can go now.."" As if a curse had been lifted I could feel my legs again, so I stood up quickly, causing blood to rush to my head, making me dizzy, stumble, but I regained my footing and ran from the scene, I didn't stop running until I got home. I left a trail of dust behind me as I sprinted, every bird call, and crunching leaf kept me going, I was fueled by fear..That image is still vivid in my mind, retrieved from my subconscious a couple times a year to be recycled in my nightmares.. Its eyes, its nose, its satisfied red smile like a killer clown's.. I saw them all the time..I used to tell people about it, tried to warn them about the demon cat of Wild Rose Lane, until my parents got tired of my nonsensical rambling and forced me into therapy.. I don't blame them, I wouldn't have believed me either, but I saw it, and now, I can never unsee it.."
Looking in a bookstore or library for a sign from God. Why not a church?,"I almost always get lost. It is a habit; I think. Why? To find ones self, one has to be completely lost at times.That is at least part of my thought process. I usually look for a sign to follow.Examples?If I am new to a town and want a great place to eat? Find a large person who eats out and follow them or ask them where they like to eat.Why? Most large people or strong people tend to eat at good places because they like decent meals.Signs are everywhere these days, about the ends of time. But I keep on ranting and raving and finally giving up on people. Why?Because it is the signs of the time.Can only point out 666 and 2000060606 so many times as the patent number for cryptocurrency being put into the vaccine. Before people dont listen. Or maybe they already accepted their fate and dont care?Fate? That is a sign. Fate is real.Lets be honest, I used to believe in you make your own luck. And? I am a fickle person to luck. I have lost my business, my career, my eyesight, my left foot, right ankle, etc. I thought God had a plan for me. And luck be there, I will fulfill it.Now?Now I realize Fate is real. It is not what you expect. Everything, even evil, is planned out for by God. Which means? There is no such thing as chance.Chance? Betting all that is wild, not luck or chaos. There is no such thing as chaos.That seems rather not true people claim. All I can say is John Von Neumanns last paper, which is not published in this reality, stated the math terminology that chaos is not real.That makes this whole game absurd if you read the Secret of Light and realize you are nothing more than an advanced avatar in an absurd game called life.I thought I would play the game of life better, to be honest with you.A sure sign that I dont know nothing and you? You need to figure out the signs of the time.The religions are dying.People are not praying.Pray for peace is all I can say. That too is a sign.Peace, peace, but they will get nothing but war.That is the signs of the time.With that as an introduction. At times, I get lost by signs. I recall being lost in Washington, D. C for a time. Circled the whole city twice because they removed a off ramp sign. And?I found a bookstore. And asked for directions. And they told me the sign was down. Would have saved me an hour of driving if I had done that sooner.However, while I was there. I found a book. I would suggest you read it with care.It is a dark secret. If you read it wrongly, you could end up who knows where.The book? The Secret of light. What will it tell you?Complexity and poetry aside?That if you eat plants, and plants are stored light / energy. You are nothing more than stabilized light. Or an avatar? In some absurd game called life.Wild no?Other secrets you can find at a library if you look for the right signs?Depends on what day and what reality you are in, I suppose.For some realities, they have forgotten how to read. And being ignorant, they proclaim their intelligence. By making those who read, sit back and watch the ends of time.I suppose the Bible is a good sign. It shows a road map. Be good. Sure, sure. Do good. Yeap, yeah. Nothing wrong with stating do unto others as you would have them do unto you.Pray for peace? That is extremely good.Pray even harder maybe that will change reality?Why?The signs all point to the ending of time.Mark of the Beast? Yeap got that Revelations 13.Plague of the beast? Yeap, got that too Revelation 6.Famine in the world? Seems more than two billion people are hungry. Instead of water or food, someone is paying to make them into vaccinated robots? So, Revelation 6 famine year, yeah that too.War? The book 50 Facts That Should Change The World says a third of the worlds population is at war. So war of 25 percent of the world seems already doable in 2008 and in 2021 even more.So signs? What is the reality we live in today?Me? I dont live here. I am passing through. That is a sure sign. I am passing through and say thank you for being here. I hope you pray for peace and pray to God for repentance and change your ways of doing good and being good.That is, there are the signs needed for today. To pray for peace. Not just scream peace. Live at peace.What signs am I looking for?I am no longer sure. I used to be able to look at signs in the library or bookstore and could tell which way a reality was heading.Why?Too much sex decay. Too much war poverty. Too much food gluttony. Too much evil lack of justice.The signs were always on the bookshelves. Meaning? You walk in and could tell what people and the world were thinking about. Meaning? You are what you put into your mind.And the outcome of what you put into your mind is already historically shown what the outcome is.You put too much x in you get triple rated xxx. You put too much violence in you get too much violence.The same with bookstores and libraries.If you wanted stable families, you would put in Waltons or some family show where people cared.You want divorce or unhappy women. Give them a love romance where the guy pays the bills. Comes home fixes her hair. And washes her cats. All while making love to her. Come on. You become what you think.Meaning? There is a reason the dragons stopped eating people in these realities. So many village idiots because a dragon knows you become what you eat. Signs?Sure I can see signs. What can you see?So? There I was in a library looking for signs. And? I found one. Read the short story in comments."
Hot cup of coffee!,"Hot cup of coffee   When I was young, my mother worked all the time in the hospital as a doctor and I spent most of my time with my grandmother. My grandmother had a small but very cozyapartment and I was particularly fascinated by the wallpaper covering all the walls in all the rooms; on which there were drawings of families outings in nature with the pets running here and there. The families had lunch and snacks with a cup of hot tea or coffee. I would contemplate on these drawings for long periods of time and let my imagination run wild and a lot of daydreaming as you can imagine !And my grandmother always used to tell me: What do you like about this wallpaper? I can assure you its the same thing everyday and it will never change. My grandmother was drinking coffee, unusual for the Russian people who love tea, with some local pastries ( pirojkis), that have been passed down from generation to generation. And I wondered why my grandmother used to drink a big cup of hot coffee every day.And one day I decided to ask her to put an end to thismystery that differs from all the neighbors who only drink one drink as if nature did not produce anything else on the surface of the earth! One day I decided to ask my grandmother why she chose hot coffee instead of tea, and there was always only one answer to this question: Not now! One day, it was a Sunday and my mom didn't go to the hospital because it was a day off, so we decided to go out for a short walk and of course to do some Picnic, and go out for a relaxing day in nature. These were the happiest moments of my life when I could spend some quality time with my mom ; I used to ask her all the way about the names of trees and their fruits and plants and wild and non-wild flowers without tiring or getting bored. My mother also answered me with enthusiasm and eagerness to make up for the long absences, she was feeling guilty without any doubt. The nature was beautiful and the weather at the end of August was great with no chance of rain. A lot of birds were singing around us; I was always curious about their names and where they came from, and why birds have always to travel to other exotic lands, and not happy to stay where they are , just like us: humans! I was also wondering where they were hiding during the cold season and who gave them this feather and who painted it in all these vivid colors! I was dreaming as well, in my daydreaming to have the chance to get similar colors; that much I loved artistic asp of the nature, without knowing it at that time. Clouds seemed to be always amused to play the hide and seek game; I was looking at and following these clouds and I remember asking the adults around me: why clouds cry? Why hurt them and why, they never hurt anybody and they are always there when we need to talk to anybody. But they dont find in return anybody when they need to cry, and everyone is just running away, is it fair? I dont think so. Once, one frog was hit by a car on the high way, though it was just playing and jumping. They say that in France they eat frogss hips, may be thats why they jump all the time to spoil their meals eaten with a lot of spicy sauces and considered the best on the menu! I look to all these flowers around me, are they the reflections of the birds colors? Or may be they got painted when the clouds were crying. May be its the sacrifice clouds are doing by giving all these colors to the nature, and the flowers are getting all the compliments; life is not faire, even the sky knows that. Not all the flowers are lucky, some of them are massacred and their souls are hidden is bottles of all typa de sizes, do they keep them for the next life? Do flowers have reincarnation too? The rainbow is a faithful friend, he never leaves the clouds when they are crying. Can we find a lot of rainbows in our life time, or its only one and has expiration date just like the honey in the jar? Please rainbow, dear rainbow, get cloned and I promise Ill get you a true identity card. what do I suggest? I suggest that there will be a village for flowers and another one for birds and bees, and that there will be a huge beauty contest where the sky, the cloud and the sun would represent the jury! The criteria of Miss gardens is to be the least selfish by donating all the extra colors and spread it around, just like a magic dust that would turn into fruits and candy to feed everyone. If I knew later that these moments could not be repeated, I would have put them in a box and sealed it so that I could smell its perfume later when I walked on the rugged serpent road with deadly slopes.But my innocence was showing me that these moments are certainly the beginning of more beautiful and beautiful moments. And then my mom said let's sit here and have lunch before sunset. After lunch, my mother brought out cups of tea for me and her, but she brought out one small cup for my grandmother for coffee. I said to my mother with enthusiasm: Mama, this cup looks like the one drawn on my grandmother's wallpaper! My mother laughed and said to my grandmother: As far as I remember it was a gift from Jean-Pierre before he left back to France when the war was over, wasn't it?! Now, when I grew up, I realized that coffee love is also inherited!"
Pretty Pair Ava and Mia,"Ican hear the chirping of birds whispering in my ears, the Sun denies his awakening, covers with those grey fluffy clouds, the cool wind makes those tiny steps and get into my wraps that cools my breath, chills my cheeks, makes my eyes to close tight, strengthens me to stay in my ' own dreamy land'.A little dragonfly enters the window, her spongy wings sways as swings, busses my cheeks that made my eyes opened. Instantly, my bossy brain pinches me to let me visit those unforgettable, lovely days of the two cutie pies (of course it's me Ava and my little sister Mia) Now my eyes are blinking and fingers are wiggling, rush to my bossy brain,""Am I fully awake?"" I ask""Of course, you are but I am not."" she whispers""For we are travelling to the past apart..."" she addsUnexpected visit to those moments instantly refreshing me,""For I need it more and more"" I cordially pronounce.In my(Ava's) own dreamy landI could see those pretty girls, waiting in the morning, welcomed the red tiny flowers of cypress vine. We admired the deep blush that spread all over there. Yeah! We almost looked like fairies there. As I was a shrinking violet, Mia was as playful as a kitten. We were thick as thieves.We little fairies turned aside, where the flowers of 'flaming trumpet' dressed in orange, the stunts of the wind blow that cool our skin, our eyes rejoiced and our hearts overwhelmed,""For we love to welcome the flutter of the butterflies."""" Hey! that's for me"" little Mia exclaimed""Which one?"" I asked"" One wears the black wrap with the fluorescent dots"" Mia replied"" It's mine"" Mia jumped and announced""So beautiiiifullll...."" we whispered in unison.Not even completed the word 'beautiful', one more lined up to share the crown of 'The beauty'.""Wow, I love those wings in blue, which visit for me!"" I exclaimedWe two lovelies chased those colourful wings, just to catch and letting off our hands once theirspongy moves got over on hands and cheeks.As we walked and gazed at the sky, ""Look there, the sky is lightning."" Mia announced""Hear the thunders following."" I declaredWe two smelled the petrichor,of course it determined the sudden visit of the bubbly clouds, transmuted as rain.""Shall we walk in the rain together"" Mia requested""No dear, then we won't be well, come with me"" i responded with care.As we felt the instant pitter - patter rain drops, we head palmed and ran towards the nearby arch where the flutter of butterflies, romanced with those climbing roses, dressed in white. while the sky was lightening and the thunder started the ceremonial drumming, me and sissy went on with the beats of the every dark clouds. Tap, tap, tap, the million taps at once, match the beat of the music band, we realized the 'Opera' started from ' The sky land' to 'The water land'. our hands swayed from side to side as we felt us, we were the 'bandleaders'. Once nature stopped the 'opera', we started off with the well known rhyme.""Rain rain go away come again another day little cuties want to play rain rain go awaaaaaaaayyyyy"" we sang in courus.We jumped and sang this repeatedly as we sent off the rain. Soon it turned out to be 'The End', now it was their turn for the paper boats, got dressed to visit the 'water land'. We folded the papers very lightly, so it could swim for a while.Ava and Mia's excitement after the rainAs time passed, the Sun awoke to shine through the calm clouds, the 'Rainbow Nation' started marching with the vibrant outfits. As we knew that soon it turned out to be 'The end', we both moppets, bumped over to touch the shades of the brilliant spectrum that sprinted through the sky. Our lips twitched and eyelids fluttered as we held the awaited paper boats.We moved on, leaned down and displayed the array of colours. As they knew that was their turn to sail on the 'non-permanent water land, they blew with hope and danced cheerfully."" row, row ...row the boat..."" we sang gleefully.Once the band of the thunder followed the eye catchy lightning ended their show, the silky breeze made the wind chimps blew while the distant tinkling bell landed into our clogged ears, we rushed to visit the man from the 'Ice land' to be melted with those frozen ice creams. "" I want strawberry ice cream cones."" Mia jumped and said. ""Me too"", I joined her cheerfully.While the wind was pretty foggy, our sights were wandering for those insects in a dorm mate state.As the Sun grinned through the droplet of the rain, we clenched our feet on the wet soil .We held our hands together and made those tiny steps on 'The grass land', our foot drenched and tongue numbed while our hands had been flooded with those melted ice creams. Our toothstarted their tap-tap band and cherished the shivering, the rain lilies grinned and welcomed us on the way home.While we two sisters greatly admired and renowned nature, the worms were on pins and needles since their burrows had been flooded and placed them like fish out of water. As they came out breathing, we promised that we would not let them be worried and homeless.""Can I get a stick?"" sissy asked""Stick, stick for what?"" I questioned ""Ava! We can take all those warms and leave them on the nearby lawn"" sissy replied by heart.We gently turned the sticks to the lawn, they effortlessly moved and burrowed into the muddy and trodden grass. We sent off the warms and spent our time, playing in the sand joyfully as the day was long.The crows stood frozen, came out from the intense trees shimmering their wings and prepared to be arisen. Caws, caws... crows sounded with repetitions, seemed like they were alarming among them to be ready and flew awaaaaayyyy. It was after been raining cats and dogs, me and sissy jumped over to climb those branches of trees which wore the frozen garlands of raindrops. Shake, shake, shake it out. Too many droplets showered at once , leading our way home zestfully.'Ava and Mia's love for Mom'As we were constantly on the go with nature, it was time for 'peppery and gingery' food as our stomachs were growling. We were nearing mom in the kitchen, rushing around madly, checking every nook and corners to fill our stomach before breakfast. ""Moooommmmmm, we are feeling hungry...."" we shouted""yeah!! ready, ready. Me and dad are waiting for you angels."" mom replied instantly.Garlic breads with scrambled eggs and spicy hot tea were served for us. There is nothing that could replace mothers love. She wiped us with the set of towels hurrily and dried before feeding us food mixed with love.""Love you Mom."" we mentioned"" Me too, Angels."" mom smiled and whispered.""I'm your first love."" I pronouned""Mom! its me."" Mia responded""I love you both."" mother consoled""No mom, It can be just one."" Mia urgedAs we were awaiting her response, ""you both represent my eyes."" mom replied affectionately""And I am eternally yours, my smart Ava and cute Mia"" she whisperedWe showered each other with hugs and kisses repeatedly.""Love you Mom."" Me ad Mia chanted as we know that she was our best friend forever.'In the garden'Once we had our breakfast, dad noticed the soft hearted moringa plant, that would never stand straight and fight against the thunder storm. There it had been bent and leaned with the branches that had gone, we with our dad tied it along with the neem tree which could the support for long. We collected the ripped chikoos and guavas which had fallen, the puffy long tail squirrels left them, which might have caused us pollen. We urged to bite those sweet chikoos and guavas. ""STOP, it would cause infection, You should avoid these fruit in the current climate"" dad sent us a warning.Her face turned red and eyes shed tears, i agreed with regrets ""Please dont cry dear,"" i murmured in her ears as my heart pains with tears. I rushed to the other side where the tall papaya tree stood straight, grinned and offered those sweet yummy fruits. ""Miaaaa...Papayas are here!!!"" I shouted merrily.She grinned from ear to ear and ran to the terrace to reach the tall tree.""Ava, wait for me, its my turn, i will pick it now"" Mia shouted merrily.As we always competed with each other in collecting the fruits from the trees, I allowed her silently as i know that i made her happy. Mom served us with tiny slices of fruit.""Hmmmm Yummy Yummy, soooo sweeeeet"" we whispered and ate them complete gleefully.Our keen ears received the oink, oink sounds of the piggies in the neighboring sty. We moved to the garden, where the stout bodied piggies murmured with their pinkish wet stouts in hungry, swineherd rushed with the basket of fresh curly cabbages and greens sliced. Of course, it was a strong down pour that cause the delay in feeding the piggies.'Ava and Mia's noon'As we learnt that the fallen moringa leaves were rich in iron, mom cooked and served it with the brown rice and she prepared the moringa flower's receipe too. ""Yeah, we know our mom is a ""MasterChef"". Our regular visiter during lunch time joined us for food. Of course, it was none other than a sleeky squirrel.Once we finished the lunch, we gazed through the windows where the children panicked as they unlooked for monkeys. We too frightened for a while, soon our fear turned into laugh, the monkeys slipped and hanged over upside down with their acrobatics for long. Not only the monkeys, we too got into action, imitated them for a while, they had run to escape and gone.In the chapelThe sound of the chapel bell rang,Its time for the prayer. our mind alarmed.""Ava, Mia ... Be ready, hurry up."" dad alertedWe refreshed quickly and my sissy brought the candles to light, i took the garland made of jasmins cheerfully. On the way to chapel, one could not miss the elderly Mother, resting in the wooden chair. Her misty hair and divine face were the most admirable sight. Her mouth was chantting prayers with rosary, her face was as brightened as the 'halo'. I voluntarily took one of her hands and kept on my head since her eyes were cloudy. 'Good evening Mother!' we whispered ""Very good evening my children!"" she respondedAs one of her hands was on my head,""God bless you my child!"" she blessed Now it was cute Mia's turn, she took her hand from my head and shifted it to her head.""Bless me Mother."" Mia asked""God bless you my child!"". Mother delivered with smile.I could remember that days never pass for us without he blessing. She never miss to bless us all with her wobbly hands inspite of her old age(must have crossed 100 years) We entered the chapel with smile while the others were still queued for her blessing. We started our prayers ``Thank you, Lord, for your blessings. In our memory, we would never demand in our prayers, as we had many reasons for rejoicing.Once we were home and finished the dinner, we were waiting for mom. Of course, everyone knew that the mother's lap was the safest and happiest place to sleep peacefully. As we realized that our day today work almost went on and repeated with nature, we would never get bored or worried of those repetitions.In my bed"" Mom I want noodles."", an Instant voice sounds. Me and my bossy brain realize that we are fond of those lovely days. My mind was flooded with those thoughts of wonders as I knew that those were never returned tenders."" I am coming dear..."" I whisper"
Hands,"The children of the seaside town joyously ran around the hills holding out their handheld sparkler fireworks beaming bright red, green and yellow sparks of light. After a few hours of feasting, playing and watching the adults light the skies with colorful rainbow explosions, the children would run indoors for an enthralling story time session. Even some of the adults would join in, mainly my brother Johnny who would enjoy chiming in and creating a puffery of sorts.""Aunt Aurora!"" they endearingly called out. ""When can we hear the story of Grandpa Murphy and the Deep Sea Monsters?""My Daide had long passed now, but he left beautiful memories and lessons with me. Ones I revered and shared with the younglings in town. Stories of bravery that ultimately reminded me of the symbolism of his hands and what they've built throughout his years. Those callus rough warm hands that held my mother as an infant and welcomed her into the world, they similarly introduced me to my love of the oceans. I remember him holding my hands lovingly while he strolled me around town, they were never soft and smooth but dirty and gruffed with salt crystals. They smelled like the fish and lobsters he'd catch during his excursions.Holding them reminded me of security and calmness like that of waves on an early morning. Consequently, they also reminded me of how wild and terrifying the open waters could be, like a constantly changing living organism.""Children, look at those unique hands of yours"", I began the story the same every year, trying to get the children inquisitive and engaged.""Those hands of yours they tell a wonderful story"". I say, ""Every wrinkle, every scar, every burn mark is a story of your life, your adventures"". I looked over to see the children stare intensely at their open palms and fingers to explore the creases and broken lines. They laughed and began to peer into their neighbors hands. ""Every hand is different, some are soft and smooth, some are molded by the wrinkles of time, polished by the rays of the sunlight"". It was like an ethereal connection, not just physical.I sat on the chair in front of them, slidingthrough images of Grandpa Murphy on his boat holding out enormous trophy cod fishes and working on his boat. ""This story is about the incredible pair of imperfect hands of a brave old fisherman from Waterford Harbor, one as mighty as you'll ever remember. I looked around the room and their curious eyes were widen with intrigue. ""And one last thing..."" I say pausing for dramatic effect. ""These pair of hands were missing a pinky!"". To their gasps I proceeded to explain as vividly as I could, they stared and balled their small hands into fists and rested them under their chins listening attentively.Fifteen years ago, Grandpa was woken up by screams of a scared little girl who saw the fiercest monster in the darkness of the ocean. But, she refused to speak a single word about the mysterious giant in the sea, instead keeping her secrets to herself.Those small secrets turned into bigger ones, Uncle Johnny was the first to hear of them. This giant had eyes like windows of a lighthouse and tentacles almost as tall as them. Though they were as real as anything she refused to burden her grandpa dismissing it as an isolated event.My brother had just came home from a three month work at an oil rig in South America for the week.After explaining my sightings to Johnny, he says to me, ""Look at me, Aurora, I know my baby sister, I know when you're lying"". He couldn't believe a creature so big could exist. Even longer than the fifteen feet long female anacondas in the tropical Andes he's told me about.Then me and Johnny began to notice stranger events in town, incidents of docked boats getting destroyed and strange shadowed sightings from around town. They escalated when a fisherman disappeared and the fish became scarce. Me and Johnny would read the newspapers to find clues to pinpoint the sightings, we finally discovered they lead to Nohoval Cove. Given the high amount of migratory fish that swam by the surface at nighttime, it seemed like the right location.We had finally decided to tell grandpa and he immediately came to the conclusion he wanted to confront the beast. We would set out to sea armed with flashlights, flare guns and other miscellaneous items that illuminated light. Grandpa carried a large heavy metal case with him and dragged it to the boat.""Aunt Aurora, Aunt Aurora!"" the kids called out raising their hands up.""Yes?"" I pointed to a young boy waiving it higher than the rest.""What was in the metal case?""he says.Oh, it's a secret, you'll know soon enough! We sailed out several feet from shore in the middle of the cove in our boats waiting hesitantly. If anything happened we weren't too far away from the shore to rush over and escape. Then suddenly that same trembling growl begins to emit from below the ocean creating ripples on the surface. I knew the sound too well as they replayed in my nightmares. The beast propped its head up for a brief moment before it vanished into the darkness below. I jumped and alerted Johnny and Grandpa.Then almost instantaneously our boat began to vibrate again more violently. Then almost as if it were guided by a ghostly pilot, the boat began to move by itself deeper into the ocean further away from shore. We almost crashed onto the rocks protruding from the surface as our boats scraped them passing by.Grandpa tried to override the boat trying to turn on the motor but it malfunctioned. I tugged on Johnny's hand frightened, then suddenly the boat stopped. Like a calm before the storm the creature reappeared but this time almost in front of us. It crept in closer and beckoned us with its tentacles stretching from every direction pinching the wood as if it were fragile and easy to break.""May the cat eat you, and may the devil eat the cat, you evil beast"", yells Grandpa holding out his flare gun waiting for the right moment, he shoots it in the air startling the beast. It swam away but not before divulging the skyline from obscurity, the horizon blocked by large tall vertical shapes. We realized he was not alone, beneath us revealed tentacles squirming allover the ocean. They slithered around, one foot in the water would risk being drowned and entangled in their tentacle traps. In the distance some of their heads poked above water as they approached. Some were much larger than the first monster, almost tripled in size.Grandpa yelled but his voice disappeared in the symphony of growling and erratic water splashes, he fell off the boat and tripped tangled on a rope. Johnny tried to pull grandpa back, his hands wrapped in the suckers of another giant squid, he bled fighting them away. Grandpa yelled for the metal case while trying desperately to climb back on the boat hanging from the edges with one hand. Johnny was finally able to pull him back yanking him from the the collar of his shirt. Grandpa then ran to the case enclosed and pulled out a large harpoon gun from inside. He could barely hold it straight as he wrestled to balance it, he hugged it under his arms and pulled the trigger. The giant was injured as it ripped one of his tentacles clean off, much like when he took Grandpas pinky several years ago in a vengeful fashion. The beast screamed out and moved away, while the rest of the creatures came closer. They created small whirlwinds beneath the water.After being surrounded we panicked and emptied out our pockets and bags for anything useful.I hadn't considered the damped firework in my pocket. Our last resort, I grabbed it and held it up towards Johnny's face.His trembling hands pulled his lighter and flicked the striker, nothing. The tentacle beast closed in and surrounded us each now whilst pushing the boat side to side. Once more Johnny flicked the striker and no luck. Grandpa ran towards us and flicked his match the first try and held it to the fuse of my firework. Third times the charm. The spark trickles over to the firework and soon after shot out to the skies, creating a loud deafening explosion, sparks of flickering flames danced in the sky. The creatures from beneath disappeared back down to where they came from.From this day forward the tradition was born. The three of us escaped back to shore with the guide of the light house. We had alerted all of our neighbors in town and shared our warnings. Now, before the fishing season commenced, in March we began a tradition for a firework show. It served to bless the fishing harvest season and to keep the beasts under control. We kept the tradition alive throughout the years. The marks on our hands caused by the smoke powder and small burns were our testimony. My grandpa's hands eventually worn out, but his legend and the tradition he set out to bring the small town together would live forever."
The Man,"CW: violence, killing/suicideShe saw the man, casually walking past the end of her driveway as she cleaned her kids dinner plates up. She didn't think much of it at first. It's a small town, and people usually walk around at night to get some last minute exercise before it got too dark. In the back of her mind, though, she wondered who it was. That thought was quickly interrupted by the sound of her daughter yelling at her son.""Bed time!"" she shouted down the hallway, and a second later, the sound of brushing teeth began. As she washed the dishes, the man started popping into her mind once more. Maybe it was the scary movie she watched last night that was putting her on edge. Still, there was an odd sense of familiarity about him. The way he was walking, his posture, and the way he hesitated briefly when he got to the gravel of the drive butting up to the street. She'd worry about it later, she thought. Her newfound way of thinking since becoming a single parent. Only so many hours in the day to worry about things. She didn't see much sense in taking any of that precious time to worry about a little paranoia when there were more practical things to fret over. Bills, job hunting, and scheduling her week out needed to be front and center on her mind. After reading her kids a story and tucking them in, the silence and calm of the home she had made for them after the divorce crept in. She had moved her little family so many times in the past three years, she wondered when it was going to stop. The prank calls that scared her from the small outskirts of a larger town. The vandalism done to her car left her fleeing from the bustling metropolis. She had hoped that moving to a tiny town would give her some peace. She chose her home town for many reasons. He wouldn't think to look for her there. Too many people had seen his face when she brought him down here to meet the family. Still. the thoughts wouldn't leave her mind. Grabbing her planner and pen as she made her way to the desk in the living room, the man invaded her thoughts once more. ""I'll just look outside, and see that he isn't there. That'll calm me down."" A rational thought, until she pulled back the curtain and saw the outline of a man leaning against her trash can. Panic set in. She had escaped her ex-husbands abuse 3 years ago. Surely he wouldn't come around now. She looked again to the trash can and he wasn't there. Peace washed over her for only a second. The outline was now at the door of her car. A mere 20 feet away. She knew she wasn't crazy. She quickly grabbed her phone and dialed 911. The dispatcher let her know it would be a few minutes before anyone could arrive. A few minutes might be too late, if it was the man she thought it to be. She ran to the door of the room her precious babies were sleeping soundly in, when she had a thought. ""Did I lock the door?"" A second later, she heard the front door open, slowly as if to not disturb the inhabitants of the home. She peeked around the corner, hoping it was just the wind. ""That doors been broken forever, there still might be hope"" she thought. That hope was quickly crushed when the man, none other than her ex-husband slowly walked to the start of the hallway. She ducked into the door of her kids room, and started moving whatever furniture she could behind it. The hope chest, filled with her daughters extra clothes. The desk her kids had started using for homework. She woke the kids up and got whatever shoes she could find on their feet. The windows in the house have always had issues opening, but still she hoped one would work, just this once. As she started lifting, the door started to shake. He was pounding on it with what sounded like both fists. She didn't stop to listen to what he was yelling. She had to get her babies out, if nothing else. The window was sticking, as per usual. She had no choice. She grabbed a blanket from her sons bed, and broke the glass. She had to get them out. Just as she started lifting her daughter to get her through the window, a bang. It pierced the air and made their ears ring. Then another. They ducked under the bed and tried to stay as quiet as they could. A second later, the top half of the door was pushed into the floor. She looked up to see feet coming around the side of the bed. They paused when they got to the long side of the bed and she saw the pants legs rise. She knew she would have to sacrifice herself to get her babies to run out. A hand appeared, and she did the only thing she could think to do. She grabbed it and bit as hard as she could. The figure pulled her out from underneath the bed as she screamed for her babies to run. It wasn't until a light was turned on and the man held her tight that she realized it was her neighbor, who had heard the commotion and ran over. A second later, the red and blue lights shown through the broken window. She ran outside, only pausing once to find the body of her ex-husband laying on the floor outside of the kids' room. As she ran out of the front door she scanned the yard, hoping her kids hadn't ran out before the police got there. The officer tried to make her sit but she refused. After a short search of the lot next to hers, they found the kids. Huddled up under some bushes. She knew her kids would be terrified of nights for a short while, but they were still having night terrors from the abuse they had witnessed before the divorce. She picked them up, and held them tighter than she ever had. She wouldn't let them go for as long as they'd stay in her arms. As she sat there, breathing in the smell of their shampoo, she couldn't help but release a sigh of relief. ""It's finally over"" she whispered under her breath. ""We're safe at last."""
Those Eyes,"As any other day she woke, and as every other day; the first stop was the bathroom. As she sat, letting the first river of the morning flow she felt the flickers of the dream she woke from. She was herself, and yet a whole new being. She had always had a love for mythical beings, fairies, pixes, unicorns and dragons took her daydreams more than any other creature of her fantasy world. She flaked it off as just another dream, and yet the power she felt, the roar that she felt as she woke herself to it. Emma was always a wild child, one who walked to the beat of her own drum. Everything in front of her was never enough, and so she sought out to make her fantasy secret life more real than she could ever imagine. That morning she woke as she had as a child to stare at a pair of eyes that she had thought were not her own, yet they were absolutely hers.   Emma had been forced from childhood to attend church, and was always told that her imagination went overboard. She was never supported in her beliefs and that there was more than one god and one way of life, so as they all deemed her ""weird"" she never paid any attention to said words from school peers right up to her own parents telling her that her nonsense wasn't going to be tolerated. It was then that she began keeping a journal; not of just thoughts and feelings, but of her short stories and sightings in her dreams as well.     In her dreams she was free, and could think and feel as she pleased without those who thought less of her for her beliefs that she was just crazy and her imagination would land her in an insane asylum. She had begun reading books about dreaming, astral projection, and other forces of the universe being very much alive in some modern civilization.     As she grew older, and beyond the condescending comments of family, she graduated and went on to study occult in college. It wasn't long before she earned a degree in occult studies and creative writing. Not long after earning her degree, she began making friends that believed the same ways she had grown accustomed to. In this, she found her tribe, her true family and those who believed as she always had. The happiest time of her life and yet she woke this very morning from the very same nightmare that had begun this way of life as a child. She was a dragon, she felt it in her gut, and in her heart and now as she stood staring at those eyes in the mirror she knew it had to be more real than a dream. The eyes that stared back at her glowing a yellow/orange color were not the eyes she had awoken to many other mornings of her life. These eyes were the ones that belonged to her soul. It was time to learn how to bring this soul back from the other side where dreams are unlimited.     Later on that day she came to meet her best friend, and high priestess and discussed what had happened that very morning. Therese had been the one to bring her into the tribe when she was just learning, and was now considered a trusted friend and tribe member. Oddly enough Therese had found an old mirror in a house she was painting for a house going up for auction. This mirror was 6 feet tall by 4 feet wide and then; It was as if a whole new life was breathed through this mirror into both Emma and Therese. They could see both of themselves as they were ever meant to be. Emma, a dragon who's colors changed with her movement and light, a mark of beauty with glowing orange/golden eyes; standing next to an enchantress with silver hair down to her feet and perfectly combed as she wanted. She wore a head piece of horns like a crown with many crystals black and silver was her dress. They decided to bring this mirror to the farm of the Crone of the tribe to see what she would think. As Therese unveiled the mirror before the crone, her reflection was that of her younger self. She was as a dragon, wolf, bear, maiden, mother and crone. Her age did not show in its form but in wisdom of the pure white hair that braided down to her feet. Her eyes were a reflective silver, showing the wisdom she had accumulated over here many years. It was then that Emma's and Therese's image changed. Emma was not a full fledged dragon but a woman with fierce muscle, wings, and a crown that of dragon horns yet the delicate beauty of a maiden. Therese's reflection barely changed, she is as she was meant to be. In the crones reflection showed not only her face but the face of Therese as well. This mirror was a mirror of truth and meant to be kept within this tribe for generations to come. This was no ordinary mirror, they were no ordinary women, they were Maiden, Mother and Crone and would go on to lead the tribe and Kin.     This mirror was kept hidden from the world for generations of this tribe. It moved on to the granddaughters of their granddaughters.     One such granddaughter, who had been given the name of her great grandmother Emma, also woke as a child one morning. She was shaking and nearly did not make it to the bathroom to see her reflection in the mirror. As this Emma was raised by those of her great grandmother's tribe, she was not afraid, but excited to see what the mirror of truth had to show her. So she then went to her great grandmother, who was sitting in the moon garden waiting. ""Grandmother, I think I've had the dream you mentioned in so many of your bedtime stories."" ""Well little Emma let us see what the truth will reveal."" The old crone spoke as she unveiled the mirror to reflect a young and beautiful dragon standing before the mirror. The old crone grandmother let tears stream down her face in pride; that she had created such a wonderful soul to carry on her protection of the tribe as maiden, then mother, and some day the same old crone she had become. Emma the elder, watched happily as the young Emma skipped back off to bed with dreams of the things she could become, while the old crone stared one last time into the mirror and became a pure white dragon and in this mirror the dragon flew away with the elder Emma.   The grandchildren and members of the tribe, allowed her a grand funeral and put her in a boat shaped with dragon's wings, into the large lake and let her blaze into the next realm as she had always wished.   The reflection on the mirror showed; as her dragon boat blazed throughout the lake; of her flying far off into the sky as a pure white dragon.         Emma Lindau"
She Will Lay My Body On The Stone,"Death rolled in, said you got ten minutes. Curt bastard. Paid no pleasantries. Take a lasting look at yourself  its the lasting one youll get. Then left. Onto the next. Hell knew what he meant by that! I was out! Tried to stand up and run  jumped right out of my skin and bones. Just left them there cold. I knew it happened straight away, felt it.  At least you get that. You feel yourself go.  Took a while to look back at where I came from. Took the wall instead. I studied the vinyl, pink pinstripes and vines of drooping flowers. Ugly, though I suppose I liked the detail, the shading and shadow on the petals. Someone had done their best, though they must've known the end would be a mess. Damned from the go with this palette. There was a painting hanging crooked on the wall. Some sort of ball field lit up on a farm with little white blots for ballplayers. There were runners at the corners.Four or five smears sat in the stands cheering them on. I couldn't place the picture. I shook where my head should've been, trying to jog it loose. Nothing. Took the wall longer than I'm proud to admit. Eventually, you gotta turn around. Face what youve knowns coming. I spun around to see more flowers, a bouquet of purple roses placed at the foot of a gurney. And there, atop the gurney, that's where I came from. It didnt feel as funny as I had expected, seeing what I'd left behind. Only forgot how old I was. Shatter mirrors, you must stop aging behind the eyes eventually. The day before I lost my hair, that was me. Never was much to look at, even with a mop. But this me therespots, flab, creases on my face like a couch cushion! Mouth hanging dry and open wide, a tube slithering out over my bottom lip  shouldve kept up better with my teeth. Couldnt see the rest, covered by blankets, mounded from a decent gut, but I expect it hid more of what was up top. Then that got me to think  truly think  for the first time here. Tried to recollect what brought me to this tacky room, to be looking down on myself.But I was left with the present. Knew who I was, but not what Id been. Oh, thats when things got hectic. Wouldve had heavy breath if I'd had any left. Wait a minute now. That was him? This is me? That was it? All that life and left with now? Where did it all go? What am I forgetting that deserved me this fate?.  I gathered what I had for thoughts, plotting. Theres no easy slippin' back into skin, I knew that. But there was a door to my former side. I came to be by it, however you may like. Tried to fling it open, bolt back to whatever possible. But I couldnt dare get a grip on the handle. Just slipped right through. There shouldve been a scream, but it was stolen, just as trapped. I looked up, as you tend to do, in contempt or for salvation. Held a share of both now. Fell to whatever wouldve been my knees,For an extension of a hand, another ante at the table. For more than this meaningless plummet, a ten-measly-minute segue. Before the whatever come next I didnt want any part of.  Death, return,. Lets discuss this. Bend the rules, if only for me alone. Dont leave me here. But dont let the clock tick out either. I looked back at poor me. Who knows what would become of that miserable heap of marrow. ...Then the doorknob twisted and she entered the room, and something returned with her. Those eyes. Cerulean? The color I chose to sound like I knew something. Fair skin and skinny, long brown hair she swore blonde. Maybe cut it all off once before. Did nothing against her looks. Always delicately dressed with the slightest hunch in her back. Almost unavoidable these days. I watched her walk bedside. More trickled in. Never late, never early; she found her way around to being on time. Always knew the right cupboard, even for the casserole dish. And she could dance. How!All I could do was my best to keep up. The memories filled me to the brim. She had brought back the past, and she was there, too, for everything that had really come to matter. Only lost her name for two more seconds. That smacked me. I wouldve smiled. Clocks ticking. I wanted to say something. Anything. She reached under the blanket, fishing for my cushionhand to hold to her chest. It was a firm grasp, strong as ever. Boy, she aged nothing like me. Remembered seeing that coming. And what? A soft, accepting shine. An old ballplayer to his skipper. We had a good run, huh? The rest spilled over. I didnt like it as much. Didnt see me in much of a light. A whole lot of concern about ending up right here. My body keeping time, but cowering inside. Then the body went, too, and it was all shambles. The whole way, leaning on her for comfort. Her body holding steady, her mind working double shifts to keep mine in order.Theres nothing so exhausting to another's soul than your worry. Thats when the dogs came home. The countless moments she gave for us. I spent my life with her; she spent her life on me.H Perhaps she'd swear it the other way. Perhaps she'd be the first to trade places. But if the impossible came to bring me back, itd be all wrong. Doesn't matter if the hand was offered. She can finally breathe for herself, for sakes. Tick-tock tick-tock. Wouldve thanked her, on my knees again. Told her how lucky I was, in life, love, death, and dancing. How glad I was that I went before. How glad I was to have her there at the end. If Death was the one that brought ten minutes, his sister must have her own obligations. And could I ask and she hear, itd be for enough time for the one I leave behind. Let her live free. Let her shine the same, and grant her that soft smile when she considers the past. Keep trouble away 'til her ten minutes arrive, and grant hers the peace she provided mine. Got a feeling the clocks about to tick out. Got a feeling I know what's next. The rest, it will all come back, too quick to recognize. But the rest matters less now, for shes my lasting look. Another year, second, or ten minutes, it's nothing but time. This is what I choose, now and ever. And for the life of me, could it get any better? But there's no need to worry now.Shell know. . ***"
The cross checked,"There are two kinds of people in this world. One who understands with no word and the other must give them solid proof to make them understand. However, it is very easy to explain to a person who understands without explanation. Its very difficult for people who need proof in every single thing to understand. Especially in a household, trust must be needed so if a person who needs proof is very difficult to deal with for the family. Understanding nothing without proof is very effective outside the family members but in his/her personal life it affects badly because family members expect to trust them when they say something. Here is a story of a person who has to deal with both personal and professional life with this kind of attitude. Darshan Rajput, an army officer, lives in Pune. He has a beautiful family with two sons named Mahesh and Suresh and a beautiful wife Jiya.Mahesh was in class 5 and Suresh is in class 3. Both the children are very studious in their studies. Darshan had a problem that he never tries to understand anything without solid proof. He was a very successful army officer; he also received several awards for his success for his attitude. Jiya is an excellent wife, a patient woman, and a good and understanding mother. But Darshan always cannot get attached to his beautiful family because of his habit of understanding anything if and only if gets solid proof. One day there was a feast in the town they live nearby. Mukesh and Suresh went to that feast with their friends. But in the middle of the feast, there was heavy rain and storm while Mahesh and Suresh headed back home from the feast. One of their friends names Subhash lives near the feast so all of them went to his house for the night as it was heavily raining. They change their clothes and stay in Subhashs house for the rest of the night. Darshan was far away from his family because of the transfer to his additional duty during those days. But soon there was news that he will return to Pune soon for a vacation. After that night the children return home the next morning. It thrilled them when they came to know the news of their fathers return. Someone spread a rumor to Darshan that his children have gone to football practice at night. Actually, both Mukesh and Suresh love to play football and have taken part in several competitions in their school and won medals also, but Darshan wants his children only to focus on studying and never like his children playing football. On one hand, it thrilled the children with the news of their fathers arrival, and Darshan was furious with his children when he heard his children were practicing football late at night in his absence just before the day he returned home to spend his vacation at home. As soon as Darshan reached home the next morning his children were not present as they went to their schools. After they returned from their school they were really excited to meet their father after a long time but as soon as they saw their fathers angry look at them they really got shocked.He scolds them very badly and also beats them. But no matter how much they try to explain to him that they went to a feast and due to heavy they stay at a friends house that night but as I mention early without proof he will not understand anything so the children get beaten very badly by their father as they cannot give him any poof to make him understand. Soon after this incident, Jiya decided to end her relationship with Darshan because she cant see her children suffer like this without their fault by their father. So soon after this Jiya along with the children went to her parents house and soon after a few months, she applied to divorce him. Soon after a few months of a divorce notice to Darshan he was shocked to see that Jiya was going to live with him but he was clueless about his own nature but he thought that if she is happy without him then he should divorce her and sign the paper. Soon after a few years, they get officially divorced like this because his inability to understand anything without proof causes him a great loss. Though he is a success in his professional life, he lost his beautiful family because of his attitude toward people. So we should always try to balance our attitude towards each other. And always keep in mind and act differently with family and the outside world. There must be communication and trust between family members otherwise we have to suffer like Darshan. Due to a lack of understanding of the children he lost everything.We should never misunderstand our family members due to some rumor outside people.Many people will say many things to you about your family just because of lack of evidence dont trust outsiders.Families will always want your happiness and always will do the best things for you. There are many secret enemies in our lives so try not to fall into their trap and try to track them before they harm you and ruin your life.There are a lot of people like Darshan who never understand anything or try to understand anyone without proof. They ultimately end up losing every precious thing in their life.So try to recognize and modify your mistakes before it becomes too late.We should act according to the peoples attitude towards us. Never misjudge your family members like Darshan did because family members are very precious to everyone. Always be attached to your family members. We should show love and affection towards our family members like our elders, spouses, and children.Dont ask family members to prove themselves to make you understand things because no one can give you proof for every small thing for then and now to make you believe."
Childhood Fantasies,"When I was younger, I lived all alone with my mum in the rustic lands of Bridgetown.Her face was always the same from when I can remember, her cheeks coloured by the twin dabs of powder she applied on both sides, her hair stained with the glossy mixture she smeared upon itthat smelled so much like the strawberry I loved.Strawberry was extremely scarce, so, it often disturbed me as to why one would rub such expensive condiment on the hair only to have it washed away, wasted like it meant nothing to them.It disturbed me so much that on one cool evening, I snuck to that small shelf where she usually kept all her accessories.I picked the object of my concern and I raised it.It looked so beautiful in the moonlight that illuminated the room.I brought it from its elevated height of worship down to my nose, and at once, the familiar scent of my craving rushed straight up my nose to my brain;taking along a pin with him, bursting all my bubbles of reason and caution.Soon it was in my mouth and I began sucking and pressing, trying to get the shiny substance in it out into my mouth.A successful attempt it was, satisfaction clouded my eyes, and I soon emptied its contents.I expected more satisfaction at the savoury taste that I had been longing for, expected to feel the warmth of sweetness in my mouth, but all that came was nothing,only a tingling and piercing taste of nothing.I immediately began a quest to get the substance out of my mouth.The more frantic my efforts, the more it dominated my mouth.I began spewing thick globs of spit, scrubbing my tongue with every piece of cloth I could view in my closed eye frenzy.My tongue felt like it was on fire.I tried to perform my mouth cleansing operation in as much quiet as possible, but my mouth didn't agree.It was fed up with the suffering it was going through and decided to protest.It began with some low tuned 'Ah's' in rhythm with each scrub I gave my tongue, and when it felt like the pain wasn't going to end, it let out a yell.My whole body soon followed suit; abandoning operation quiet that we all agreed on.I fell on the floor rolling and yelling, till my mum came running up the stairs.Her heavy footsteps initially would have been a source of panic to me, but now it was the footsteps of salvation.When she entered and saw me on the floor, she quickly scanned through the room to get what was going on, and in search of any threat that might have been the source of my predicament.She saw the opened tube of her strawberry hair relaxer lying empty on the floor, and I, still engrossed in my service of mouth cleansing; my yells reduced to short whimpers.Instantly, her demeanour of worry and concern changed to a terrifying one.She pulled me up from the floor with my ear, promptly picked me up and slung me across her shoulder, and began smacking my backside as we journeyed down the stairs; reigniting the flames of my yells.She set me down roughly on our sitting room couch and left me in my plight.I began thinking about what just happened.I knew what strawberries tasted like.Grandma always brought me some when she came visiting, and I knew it certainly didn't taste like what I consumed up there.Mum came back moments later with a strong-smelling mixture she had in a cup.It was supposed to help remove the tingling sensation she said.I accepted the cup wholesome, forgetting my disdain for anything bitter; as I would have accepted anything that would douse the flames in my mouth.I began drinking in full gulps, not bothering about the taste, just let the flames die.At the young age of eight, I didn't know much about death, but I had heard enough of it to know it wasn't a good thing.Papa I was told died because he ate something he wasn't supposed to eat, and I didnt see him again after that.Mother never remained the same after that. I never saw her smile, and she was always never there; except in the evenings.Mum just ordered me to go to bed with a note that we would be visiting the doctor tomorrow morning.Her reaction wiped out my earlier fear of death, but not my pangs of hunger.I hadn't any dinner because she didn't give me any.She probably forgot, and I was too scared to ask.As I lay on my bed that night, clutching my belly and stifling groans, I journeyed back into my world of thoughts, thoughts of the strawberry.I wondered and concluded.Maybe they created a new strawberry, one with a different taste, because they sure smelled the same.I lay there in bed begging sleep to come take me in his warm embrace, to save me from the war going on in my belly.I reasoned that whoever created the new strawberry must be a very wicked fellow, one with a very terrible taste.I imagined him to be a man and I started painting his grotesque features, creating them in my mind even as sleep listened to my appeal and put out my lights.Now I sit here at the window where I last saw her back, reflecting on where I last saw her frown. She dumped me. Dumped me in this school like a child without parents. I remember that day clearly, it was bright as light and dark as night. That day I wailed and cried to my mother and friend, but she paid no heed or hear or need or care; she just left me angry and here and hungry right there. She tried to deceive me with her fallacious promises that I had no choice but to believe. I knew deep inside that she would not keep to it.She promised to come back to take me from here someday, that she would visit me frequently with lots of goodies and strawberries. I had no choice but to believe her. Now I sit here at the window where I keep expecting her frame, expecting her smile. Now I sit here, reflecting on the whispers that fly each time I pass and the kid that shoved me to the ground and called me a lass. I sit here reflecting on the dinners I have been denied by the many bullies of this land. I sit here wishing I never loved any strawberries and I had not taken hers that night.I place the red fruit in my mouth and sink my teeth into it. It is bitter tonight, bitter like the one I tasted that night. But I chew it and swallow, because it is bitter, and it is my heart."
Taekwondo,"I was quiet as I was quite impressed by his moves. He was a fair man making a fair game at a fair near my town. It was indeed a challenging fight. It was my first time watching a live fight while I lived in Jacobabad. . A small undeveloped town. But a master of Taekwondo martial arts lives here.Today was his power show of skills in this fair. I eye on this master while sitting at a wall bar where as he was eating a bar of chocolate just before his big match.I was following him for the last 2 months without his knowledge. And today I hid myself in the left corner of his house when he left.I was right in writing down all his moves step by step. As I used to practice them just like a knight in dark nights.And then one day I will be a Taekwondo too. My feet try to copy his heroic feat. But still there was something that was still missing in me. I ate my food at eight in the night and morning. I dare my dear life to starve in hunger all day long. I saw him sewing his clothes, so I sewed my clothes just to develop the fine motor skills of my fingers. I even left the delicious deserts in my house to practice taekwondo in deserts just to build myself.I fight with the bats with a bat in caves. I have read a novel on taekwondo but still I am trying to find that one novel move which will make me the ultimate Taekwondo ever in this world.But Today I would better minute those moves in my diary, but the master just made his opponent fall down within a minute. Before I could tie up my waist to concentrate on his moves he already made his opponent a waste. Master received the winner's tie with dignity. Master was receiving a chest full of million dollars with a proud big chest. Meanwhile I was finding the right letters in my mind just to write a letter to this master. Dear respected Master of Taekwondo,I watch your fight while keeping a watch in my hand. Tears fall off my eyes as I see you tearing your opponent in seconds. Your moves sound good, but when I move my moves are just sounds. I want to be a Taekwondo.I hope to hear from you as I wait for you over here in this fair. I am that young 18 year old boy who brought you the chocolate bar before today's match. I put the letter on his clothes placed on a chair in the changing room. And now everyone was disposing, I was proposing to stay.I heard a voice: Love is an ideal thing, marriage is a real thing so If you want to gain something, you have to lose something.Now speak but dont speak without thinking. As what you will decide is going to be one small step for you, one giant leap for Taekwondo.I was flattered to see the Master himself talking with me.I have tried more than 100 times on my moves. I am willing to stretch my veins in pain, relaxing my soul in the spirit of taekwondo. Master was surveying me through utterly regal eyes. Whereas I was hiding the heavy pounding of my heart with a smile on my face. Master makes a move of his hand as to come close, leave closely.  I choose to come close.Many are called, but few are chosen.If you could quarter this ring in a quarter of second only then you can become an ultimate taekwondo. I tried to pull the ring apart with my full strength. But my veins ran in vain in making it possible. I was pulled off , Master pushed me apart after 1 hour of struggle. He just put the ring under his teeth and made a slight cut on the ring. And then under his feet with a strong powerful jump and then he pulled it apart with his hands. William Shakespeare said:Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.Force and power makes you a taekwondo, Intelligence and cognition makes you a master. It was my first step in my journey to become a master of taekwondo. This first step changed all my previous strategies. I was trying more than 100 times, failing more than 100 times. But never achieving anything. As I was moving, without a conscious plan in my moves.Finally I learned my first lesson today:If you arent fired with cognition and enthusiasm, you will be fired off, with cognition and enthusiasm.The master tapped me on my shoulder and gave me a quarter to buy a quarter piece of bread for him. It was surely a sign, an invisible sign on the invisible document of trust. I stood firm as a worker of a great firm. Making my way outside in the market with the weight of this quarter in my hand. Now, I brought one quarter piece of bread to won a heart.The master gives me a stare as he climbs up the stairs. My heart felt whole while I fell in a hole. The plant of trust has grown, I groan in the hole. I eye with a watchful eye on the master without watching my steps. So I ended up playing a bass of hope in my mind, becoming a fresh sea bass in this hole of water.I see a chance, in this sea of trouble to apply my new learning. I murmured.What did the fork say to the egg??I am going to beat youI pin my socks, trouser and shirt together making a small circle followed by a rope of clothes. And then I throw this circle outside on a tap of water. My rope was knocked and pinned fine with the tap as I stretched this rope. I stretched the rope pulling myself up and then making a taekwondo jump to jump out the hole.By the time I came out, the Master made a gesture for bye, for today.I made a quiet smile over this quiet move. And then I rest for the rest of the day. I turned off the lights to rest on my light pillow that day."
Killers Don't Carry Cards,"Daddy came home late on a summer night, stinking of wine and dead porch bugs.They didnt have a porch.His collar was stained with lipstick Momma didnt wear, and the tag stuck out of pants that werent wrinkled before he left.He took one glance at his family-- his daughter, sitting peaceful and innocent on the floor with her unicorns and her books and her fairy tales miles from their tiny house, and his wife-- Momma, that is her name-- glaring with arms crossed and thin lips he dont like kissing no more pursed. He read it all on her face. He said, God, woman, I just went to the bar for a drink.Momma said, You did not, and she left it at that.Little Kelly entered junior high with pigtails piled on her head and a frown stretched for days. Pretty as a picture, sour as a lime.She had friends in the back of buildings where they made her into a chimney, blowing smoke and spitting ash like bile, and offered her love in the shape of tiny pink pills that made the world spin around her and laughter bubble out like tears.Once a boy offered her real love, like grownups, and she said no for a little bit cause that would be irresponsible. Then she went home silly, homework assignments turning stale in her backpack.Momma waited at the kitchen table like she had years ago, same skinny arms crossed. Kelly drops her bag on the floor, sour again, and goes to make a peanut butter sandwich. I did my homework, Momma.Momma said, You did not, and there was no hug for her that night, not from a momma as sour as she was, nor from the daddy who didnt come home till dawn.And he smelled like lipstick again.Kelly went back and told the boy yes, cause if Momma werent giving her love then somebody else was.Little Kelly became Big Kelly and needed money to do all the things that made her happiness something she could hold in her hand.So small and pretty, like tiny pink babies filled with white dust.Big Kelly whined for cash but Momma said no so she whined again and tired Daddy, drooling last nights perfume onto his newspaper, handed her a twenty. Momma glared.Big Kellys money was gone fore lunch and she needed more real fast. She took a little from her classmate (friend, because friends borrow things and its okay when friends do that) who wasnt happy about it but Kelly didnt let that stand in the way. Then she knocked on doors till a neighbour grunted something about watching the chilluns. Big Kelly entered the house with her chimneys hidden in her blouse and gum cracking her mouth like a whip.The chilluns didnt talk much, blond and dirty with eyes like rats. But they liked the smell of her cigarettes and Big Kelly, despite her better judgement, found them entertaining. She decided shed babysit more from then on.When the neighbour came home she found that her eldest daughter smelled like smoke and she screamed and hollered on Big Kelly and threw her out.Big Kelly said, I didnt give her anything except candy!screamed the mother and the door slammed in her face.Big Kelly dragged her feet when she came home that night, cause nothings worse than getting in trouble and worrying your parents can smell the guilt on you.Which they usually can.Big Kelly wandered to the back door, pausing to alert the kitchen to her presence with a hesitant grunt. She heard shouts. She opened.Momma and Daddy were goin at it, and the chairs had been upturned, the table flipped onto its side. Daddy had a nose bleeding as bad as anything, and Mommas hair was all a-frizz round her head. Her skinny arms shook as she fought and Daddy stank of cheating as bad as anything.Big Kelly turned to run for a little bit and hid in the bushes like a six-year-old, cause at that moment she was six and Daddy had shouted at Momma for the first time, while that stubborn old lemon of a woman simply crossed her arms and glared, and didnt bother to cover the ears of little Kelly nervous in the corner. At that moment she was six and Daddy didnt bother to come to say goodnight anymore, cause he found another real pretty lady to say goodnight to instead, the bastard, and Momma just sat in the kitchenDaddy came storming out of the house later, shouting nasties over his shoulder, while Momma screamed back, You did ! her favourite defence when one of them was being naughty, because she knew they both hated it, having the truth shoved right into their faces. Momma slammed the doorBig Kelly slunk back in like a kicked dog and found Momma on the floor with her hands over her face and her little lemon of a mouth shrunk and drooping. Big Kelly went over to hug her nervously, cause that was what good daughters do, even though Momma could be a little scary.Right there on the floor, Big Kelly had a She was gonna be here in ten years if she wasnt a good girl like Momma always told her to be, and she wouldnt have a job cause shed have her own little girl hiding in the corner when Daddy came home from a hard day of cheatin and shed be too sad herself to comfort her (why wouldnt I comfort my own daughter? Kelly thought furiously) because Ill tell you why, it would bring up too many memories of her Momma and Daddy fighting in the kitchen. But you know what?Big Kelly was not gonna sit on the floor, and she was gonna hug her daughter like she was the softest stuffed animal in the world. And she wouldnt say, You did not, one damn day in her life.Big Kelly became just Kelly and she made friends with people who werent chimneys-- a little more boring, not to have love bottled up like that, but her new friends were easy and predictable and they liked her even if she didnt like them as much. They talked about grades and college and the guys who were cute but who they would never talk to, and Kelly soaked it in with a good deal of reluctance but a great deal of determination.Kelly graduated happy and Momma came, clapping her skinny hands and smiling, for once, not with a lemon mouth. She joined a school a few hours north of Momma and held her work-appropriate outfit up to the mirror, wrinkling her nose.Kelly pushed the ugly away into a tiny black box in the corner of her mind.Students came and most were nice except for a boy who had something of Kellys daddy in his black eyes. He shouted in class and whined and took snacks from other people, and Kelly pulls his parents aside at the end of the day. Your son was very disruptive. He stole biscuits from another little girl.He did not, the mother says with the smugness of a mother who is In The Right about her angel of a child.Kelly saw red.Have a talk with him, please, she says and turns away to scrub the anger from her eyes and push it into her little black box.Kelly got a boyfriend for a while.I made your favourite. Happy birthday, she says, setting a plate of bangers and mash in front of him.You did not, the boyfriend snaps, peering at it. My favourite is pasta with red sauce and meatballs.Kelly saw red but it went into her black box and she smiled falsely and stood to clear away his plate.Kelly started seeing red alllllll the time.A bus splashed her with water. (Her mother called. (The little boy with her daddys eyes called her a big stinky and smiled a smile so twisted, he may as well have come home with lipstick covering him and slapped her momma across the face.There was little difference to Kelly anymore.She got married despite her evil black box. Her husband was perfectly nice and smiled when she described her family, seeming to think it all a joke.She loved and hated him for it.Kelly grew to thirty (god, ) and thirty-five, and forty, and Momma stayed out in the countryside with her daddy a couple blocks away. Kelly said No to children and her husband said Okay because he was a teacher too and they had children crowding their lives already.Kelly visited her momma cause that was what good daughters did and cause her husband said it would be a nice thing. And when she opened the front door her momma was crying and it rang sharply in Kellys ears, and her daddys voice was harsh and real mean and she saw them in the kitchen, fighting again like two-year-olds.Kelly saw red.Momma was on the floor and Daddy was above with his hands raised up and mad (thought Kelly, but he wasnt he definitely wasnt, and she moved to throw him off of her and to yell, to use a voice she hadnt thought she owned, Now  and he glared and whirled around to go, and Kelly walked after him still yelling.echoed, except she thought it was probably coming out of her mouth, not just in her head. Her hands she thought were clenched into fists, except-- maybe not?-- because she was touching someone, something, and it was human and the fabric stank with cheating and he was yelling real loud, and so was someone else behind her. She loses herself in her childhood chant, You did NOT!! You did NOT!! and then Daddy was gone.Ran?No.She looks down.What was Daddy doing on the ground there, all red? She touches her eyes. Maybe she blasted him with all the red in her eyes.Momma ran over and started hollerin, so Kelly had to turn to her to calm her down. she wanted to say, You killed him, someone says, and Kelly looked at a puddle. Was that herself, looking back at her?I just pushed him, Kelly says.You did not, the puddle responds with a sad shake of its head.The end, murmurs Kelly, and she puts an arm around Momma as sirens start to wail. But be careful, or theyll run Daddy over again."
Where The Reflection Stops,"In retrospect, it was kind of odd Kitten never wondered where the old mirror came from. It was rather blatantly out in the open, set next to the spiraling grand staircase. Actually, that might be why she never really saw it before, the staircase kinda stole all the grand old things attention. There absolutely would have been some if Mr. Staircase wasnt there. The mirror was a floor to ceiling affair, all dulled silver with drops of faint gold embedded in the dark spirals framing it. The oak it was built into shone, like someone polished it, then skipped the mirror. It took her a while to notice all that though, multiple times of coming back to stare at the newly discovered bit of house. Because, well: the mirror did this fascinating thing where the entire bit of mirror that Kitten could look into had turned a deep, silvery ink sort of opaque. It was like staring into an- abyss, that was the word, right? An endless hole, or at least something that seems endless. Was that in the definition? She cant remember. Aunt Elda laughed when Kitten asked about the mirror, said dearie, thats just a silvered mirror, no abyss involved. The bits that made the mirror work got worn off, and no wonder, the things over a century old. A lot of little fingerprints found their way to it, wore the poor thing out. Huh, fingers are more powerful than Kitten expected, especially tiny child ones. They must have figured it was fingers cause the silvery abyss ended a foot over Kittens head, out of reach of the tiny ones. A shiny stretch of lake, reflecting the curves carved and painted out of the towering front halls doors, the hummingbirds she knows are drawn out of the walls, but cant actually see, lost to the distance between the mirror and what it reflects. Fascinating old thing, isnt it? Aunt Elda laughs when she found Kitten staring at it again. She squats down, smoothing her apron out as she gazes into the dark. Almost like looking into another world. She fondly points out bits of the dark world. Those two wisps of silver look like a mountain against the black, dont they? Oh, theres two people going down it, see? Aunt Elda points at two squiggles of silver at its base, one slightly taller than the other. She nods seriously, Auntie talking to her was well, it didnt happen much, and Kitty likes her, and plays with stick dolls, so she wont point out its more squiggle than person. Squiggles that seem deeper than the mountain, embedded somehow.Aunt Elda points out the impression of a river next, a steadily moving flow despite how its barely visible. Theres a hill of trees she cant actually see, hugging the edge of the mirrors working reflection. Somehow, that makes it more special, doesnt it? The bell rings, a sharp clear sound pulling Aunty away to see whatever Count Abyss wants this time. She draws herself out of her crouch, tells Kitten to go back to the servants quarters (where shes supposed to be, never actually is,) walks away. Kitten sighs, leans toward the mirror, then pulls herself away (Shes definitely not supposed to touch it.) Well, she got to talk to Auntie for a bit, so that counts for something, right? She doesnt notice shes slumping into the mirror till its too late, and her shoulder touches it. The same moment, a deep dong rattles through the room, echoing from a clock Kitten has never seen. Her arm and head slides into the shockingly warm ink just as she opens her mouth to- what, call for help? It fills her mouth, tastes strangely like powdered sugar as she drops through its thickness. It feels like everything twists suddenly, up and down flipping positions, then a rush of momentum that throws her out.She catches herself on her hands as she falls face-first onto- a black mountain? No that doesnt- it glows silver, the whole thing, but its black underneath the inch of light. The sky- its a curving black, the glow the only think showing where it picks up at the mountains end. Kitten stares up at it, sees no stars, or clouds, or any hint of color. Just the reflection of the mountain smothered in darkness. Woah she whispered, even as her brain helpfully points out mountains and skies really dont work like this, and chances are she fell asleep and none of this actually exists. She tears her eyes away, looks down the mountain. She still wants to see everything.The mountain casually ambles downhill, making it easy for the two figures further down to come up. Ones shorter than the other, Kitty thinks they might be holding hands, but from this far away its hard to tell. Theyre definitely glowing though, more concentrated than the mountain, standing out starkly, even against the river thing at the bottom of the mountain. Its barely glowing at all.Wait those figures are weirdly thin, now theyre closer. A nagging suspicion on her, Kitten scrambles down the mountain; she wants to know before she wakes up, is this-?Theyre made up entirely of one long line. No legs, no arms- theyre holding hands with their heads, hopping up the same incline Kittens running down. Just like the figures in the mirror.Hullo, slow down, youll fall on your face and get mountain smeared all over it Kitten flails to a very abrupt stop. The taller one. The taller one said that. Howd they say it? She cant see a mouth. No thats not important (yes it is! Its just not a nice thing to think about someone worried shell fall on her face.)Thanks! She squeaks out. No problem girlie. Oh, theres his mouth. Of course its where his head would be. Wait, girlie? What got you in such a hurry? You goin to a doctor?Huh? No? It naturally sounds like a question, due to the sheer amount of confusion taking up residence in her head. Oh, you should, with that number of growths on you. Theres a healer house at the bottom of the mountain, just aim for that big curve in the river. He points at a barely visible (but admittedly massive) turn in the river, set where it draws closest to the mountain. Thank you, mister. Kitten says, even as she wonders what he means by growths. She doesnt have growths and he means my arms, doesnt he? Well, so much for going to the healer house. She walks past the two of them, and vaguely wonders why they want to go up the mountain anyway. Eh, too late to ask. She walks and walks, and her brain must clock out at some point, cause shes suddenly standing at the base- at the point where the mountains glow drops, and the ground turns to black. Its not really distinguishable from the sky, at least in the places the rivers faintness doesnt touch. Its got to be important for being a clear and, if nothing else. Whats the river look like up close? She could always avoid the healers. She keeps on walking, stumbling against a rough ground she cant see. The river stays fixed in the distance. At some point she gives up, turns around to see how far shes gone-Oh. Oh boy. So, she definitely made progress, because she can see it now. Behind the mountains glow, up above and beyond it, there are hummingbirds. Theyre set next to the massive door with its own wooden carvings, and she can see them now. She can see the details of the fluttering wings and tiny beaks in the giant sky, in detail she could never hope for in the mirror itself- The world shakes. She wakes up. It was a dream."
Deja vu and nature too..,"Human nature seems cyclic. Deja vu is not just in the written novels of reality but in life. Meaning? Almost everything under the sun has been done.And? Solomon was right: living in the past was better than in the present. The only conclusion? My life was vanity and had no meaning if the future has not better or welled itself.Sad, no? Secrets of the universe ranted and raved by a madman? Or a pirate? I doubt I know which. I used to be a poet.Now?I live in a crazy fantasy worldHardly.I read to retain my sanity.I book, tea, and chill too because I like books usually more than people. However, I party better than most people, so I would rather party with the right people than read a book.And? Well, I do fall in love with characters. Most people do not realize this.This reality is just one long novel.Drama or tragedy or comedy is yet to be determined.That this is the past for me is real.Being a space time traveller was not something you plan for evidently. If I had planned for it, I would have journal-ed more when I was a kid. Why?Secrets revealed through time make reality more interesting and speculative.Which happened first second and which influenced something totally outside the realm of that person reality is a question on my mind these days.What is deja vu? What is real? What is reality? If this is all some simulator would you not expect the man behind the curtain to do a Ta Da moment revealing that you missed turning left at the right corner?Or I become the people in the book I read. To steal a quote from To Kill a Mockingbird You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.And I am as a reader or as a time traveller walk around in other people'sideas or skin and try to do that often these days. Talking to or checking out those people, that are creative and trying to figure out. What makes them tick. Or move or change reality and hope for moment in my life that brief touch with greatness or madness rubs off a little enough for me to comprehend how to be more than. More than. Well, more than normal. More than just a boring person. What is wrong with boring?Nothing. However, if you crave adventure and to be a pirate. Boring people is the way to act if you are going to con someone into letting you in. While being a light or beacon in the dark shining out for all the bugs to hit you. You might shine enough that the author of FATE or that man behind the curtain says. Well, Clint, Clinton, Clinton R, Ender, Talon, writer, poet, pirate, time traveller you have seen the game. You know the horrible truth.And yet you still play the game of life like there is something to win. Which is it. Is life a game or or the trick to be insane in a sane world?Meaning? Mark of the Beast everyone seems to know Microsoft has done it. Seems like using their corporation is no big deal to the churchs, and other religions.Vaccinating people without their concent and murdering them. Again, no biggie. In yet? Here I am ranting and raving and wondering. Reading made me live. And in reading I lived. Portals to other worlds?Please I have seen the end of time and back. Meaning? Hell is a real place I would not recommend the accommodations. And to realize reading to steal a quote again. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing. The realization I love to read to escape.Escape? I tried to escape hell for a long time. Which brings me to this place in time where the book of Revelation is in full force and I am lost. My words dont reach anyone and my ranting and raving gets me censored on Facebook to minds.Humor to be censored. That which can not stand questioning is not real. It is propaganda and to realize that humanity is the cause of the book of Revelation is sickening.That this is the past which means the ending of time makes me question my mind.Checking dates and how old the earth is instead of what year it is makes me an insane case. In yet I took photos and show them and well. I don't have photo shop and I shopped at JcPenny not JcPenney. I ate a Big Mac at MacDonald's.Meaning? All of this is the past and in the end the word FATE reads across time and makes me question my performance of this game of life.Did I do right? Did I try my hardest? Did I screw up? Did I? Did I have courage? To steal another Mocking bird quote. I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.""Did I see life through no matter what or did I fail? I fear failure more than failing. What is the difference?Simple did I continue with an attitude of hey maybe if I was a pirate I could make things right. Or maybe one of my poems or stories will uplift one person. Or maybe being insane in a sane world makes me see this world ending horribly and wonder about life and what lesson is there for me in this game of life?Game of life. That is what everyone should read the Secret of Light by Walter Russell. To condense the whole theory for you. You are an avatar in an absurd game. The game is played by 500 million advanced brains.Don't be absurd.Avatar? Let me begin. We all live via light. Energy. Plants stabilize that light into food for you. I am carnivore. Laughter animals eat plants. With that simple statement welcome to the understanding you are nothing more than an avatar in some absurd boring game.And to play it you have to break out of the game and be someone. Someone creative? Who knows.Be someone. LIVE damn it. Don't just be a stick man in a boring cartoon. Be. BE Calvin and Hobbes. Be a pirate BE a poet. Be someone.That is the problem with normal. To steal my last quote from To Kill a Mockingbird People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for."
No mobiles!,"Mark paused. Now reaching his mid-sixties, grey-haired and beginning his sunset years, he was enjoying quality time with his two grandchildren. He had retired and was now enjoying his free time immensely. 	Timothy and William, his two grandchildren, were listening carefully to him. He took a sip of his freshly brewed coffee as he paused. 	""Have a bite of the chocolate cake your Grandma has baked for you."" They started to take huge bites of the cake as they demanded, 	""Tell us more, Grandpa, tell us more about what happened to you in those days?"" they asked in unison. 	Mark smiled as he relived his past in his storytelling. ""We had to walk to school in those days. There were some omnibuses and the like, but not all of us could afford them. Me and my sister used to walk to school every day, both ways."" 	""Really? No school buses like for us? Or Dad dropping you in his car?"" 	""No. We walked."" 	""Just the two of you?"" 	""My sister used to go to a different school from mine. Both of us had some friends from our schools. Some four or five of us used to walk together and go."" 	""Wasn't it dangerous to walk all the way, Grandpa? What about speeding vehicles and road crossings?"" 	""Oh! in those days we had less traffic. The roads were few and we had special crossings for kids. The Policeman used to help us and stop the traffic till we crossed the main road."" 	""Wouldn't you feel tired by the time you reached school?"" asked Timothy, looking intently at Grandpa. 	Mark smiled as he responded, ""No Tim. We used to have a good breakfast and start. Our Mum used to make sure that we have a good breakfast before we set out to school. We also had to carry our lunch in a box."" 	""What? No canteen at school offering fresh and hot meals for lunch?"" piped in William. 	""No Willy. We had to carefully take what Mum had packed for our lunch. But it was great fun sharing our lunch with friends. Occasionally, even our teacher also would join in. It was great fun. We all ate a little bit of all the different lunches our mums had sent."" 	""Really! That must have been good. What do you think, Timmy?"" William asked. 	Looking thoughtful, Timothy asked, ""I heard from Gram the other day that there were many poor and homeless people in those days. Where any of your friends from poor families, who could not afford to bring their lunch? What about them? Would they feel left out?"" 	""Ah! This is what I wanted to tell you both boys! Listen to me now. We did have a few boys who were from poor families. Most of the time they could not get their lunch. In fact, they would come to school famished because sometimes they had no food at home for anyone."" 	""How dreadful? How could they walk to school and sit for classes with empty stomachs?"" 	""Let me tell you what we did with Richie and Paul. They were twins from a poor family and would always ask us for some food as soon as we meet in the morning. Even before the School Assembly. Both they and some of us would come to school a little earlier."" 	""So, what would you do?"" asked Timothy eagerly. 	""This is how we managed. My friends and I used to ask our mums to pack a little food extra and give us. We used to give that food to Paul and Richie. Even at lunchtime, we used to share our food with them."" 	""Then you guys would have less food to eat for your lunch. Wouldn't you also feel hungry then?"" asked William. 	""Somehow, boys, our food, as we shared and ate with these fellows, sufficed for all of us. We all used to feel satisfied and happy to share."" 	""Was it a miracle? We heard about how a young boy shared his lunch and the Lord Jesus blessed and fed some 5000 people with it?"" 	Grinning widely, Mark replied, ""That' s a good way to connect, Timmy. Actually, it was not a big miracle like that. One thing was that we used to pray and ask God to bless our food before we shared and ate it with all these fellows. So, it was enough for all of us."" 	""That sounds wonderful Grandpa! Small miracles daily? I am sure you all must have become good friends later in life too?"" 	Mark paused again as he recalled them. ""Yes, boys. Richie worked hard and became a Pastor. he is with a church down South. Paul has gone as a missionary and is serving the Lord in Africa. They are in Botswana, serving the Lord.God has blessed them abundantly. We still are in contact through email and WhatsApp."" 	""Grandpa, Grandpa, what a great childhood you had? Our school days seem bland in contrast?"" 	""Things are different now surely boys but remember to have the Word of God in the center of your life, then God will give you good memories to treasure too. One day you will be sharing your own memories with your grandchildren,"" said Mark with a twinkle in his eyes, as he drained his coffee cup and gazed lovingly at them. Both looked at him with dreams in their eyes. 	""But Grandpa,"" said Timothy as he remembered something, ""Is it true that in those days you had no mobiles, no internet and no Google? No nothing? What about Candy crush and the other computer games? How did you all manage as kids in those days? Please tell us."" 	""This calls for some more cake and coffee,"" said Mark as he sent the boys to the kitchen with the empty plate and his coffee cup. They came back in a few minutes with reinforcements. 	The lovely smells of coffee and freshly baked cake competed with each other as they wafted up to the noses of the grandfather and the kids. They sighed contently. Mark picked up his cup and started sipping while the boys each took a large slice and started eating. Silence reigned for some time. The only sound was that of the sipping and the munching. 	Fortified by the coffee, Mark started speaking. 	""In those days, when I was the age you are in now, we didn't have smartphones. Neither did we have games as you call them now. But we had a lot of fun. We went out and played in the streets and on playgrounds with our friends. Yes, we used to go and play physically. We used to get dirty too and get scolded by our mums!""  	""But how would you do your homework without Google or the Internet to help you?"" 	"" We used to listen carefully in the classroom. Then if we had a doubt we used to go to the library. We had a small one at home and a larger one at school. A much larger and better one was in the Town Hall. In fact, that was my favorite haunt when I was in school. Oh! what a pleasure it was to go to the library and sit for hours together!"" 	""Yah! I heard about something called an Encyclopedia. What was it, Grandpa?"" 	""Oh! That was our Google then. There were some 27 to 30 volumes, each one huge and having thousands of pages. They had all information then available put forth in a systematic fashion. Alphabetically. We just had to select the right volume and browse through it. It took some effort from us but was very rewarding. I remember stopping by and reading other pages as we were searching for an entry. That was my favorite distraction!"" 	""But Grandpa, how would you play? No Game boxes and Play stations?"" 	""Oh, we used to have fun playing live games outdoors. We would play baseball, football, and cricket. And other folk games like hopscotch, hide and seek, and what not. They were so exhausting. Our Mum used to send us straight for a bath after we came home. But we enjoyed every bit of playing with friends. All our games were live."" 	""What would you do if it snowed or rained outdoors Grandpa?"" 	""Good question, Willy. Then we had a store on inboard games: Carroms, Snakes and ladders, Monopoly, Ludo, Scrabble, Chess and so on. My favorite was snakes and ladders. We used to go up and down many times before reaching the goal. Even Monopoly was very engaging. We used to play Scrabble sometimes with grownups too! Those were the days, indeed."" 	Mark went off into a reverie, reliving his past as a child in his grandfather's home. The boys William and Timothy sat in awe as they considered how their grandpas childhood was. 	""I didn't know you all had such an active and fun time when you were kids Grandpa. I always thought that life without the internet and smartphones or Tabs would have been boring and monotonous! Looks like your lifestyle was even better than ours now!"" 	""It was Timmy, it was, indeed. We didn't even know about smartphones and the like then. And books, I forgot. My favorite pastime was to read books. I used to read all sorts of fiction and science fiction was my favorite genre. I was a regular in the Town Hall Library. Every time I used to borrow books and return them. The Librarian was fond of me and used to let me borrow new books even before cataloging them. Of course, I was faithful in returning them."" 	As the two little boys listened to him and thought through, values were being passed as a legacy through the generations."
"The School Sports Day, a memoire........","The date is imprinted on my mind, 14thJuly 1972. It was a Friday, it was a warm sunny day, but the worst thing about such a fine sunny day was that it was going to be ruined. Why, because it was the school sports day. I hated school sports day because I am not the type of person who likes to be at the forefront of attention and as I was to take part in the event, for me it was a day of dread! The day began by having to attend school at eight thirty, taking with you your sports kit in preparation for the event or events that you were due to take part in. This instruction however, meant travelling two miles in the opposite direction from the sports ground just to shout out Yes Sir to Mr. Grimsdyke, the form teacher at registration before then having to make your own way on foot the four miles from Longbridge to Bournebrook sports ground where the sports day event was always held. My group of friends were a diverse bunch from all backgrounds and had known each other through previously attending the same school and had bonded in some sort of strange way. We always hung around together when at school, looking out for each other, watching each others back. I think the reality of it was that as a group of friends we were amongst the poorest in our school so always had to find ways around anything that involved paying out money. Getting to the sports ground was simple according to Mr. Harvey the headmaster, just catch the number twenty seven bus, it stops right outside. Sure, buses pass there alright but that meant paying for the privilege which for us was out of the question, we had no money. None of us could afford pushbikes either, so we had no choice but to walk. The school could not afford to supply a bus but they expected everyone to make their own way to the event, something that would not be allowed in today's world! To amuse ourselves en route, we used to wave at the bus drivers and passengers as they sped past using our specialised and crafted ""Winston Churchill"" gesture which involved the raising of two fingers. We couldnt really see who was on the bus because of the reflection of light on the glass, it was just a bit of fun to us, we were just fourteen and making the best of the situation we were in at the time. We knew all the short cuts around the area, all the alleyways, all the cut throughs; they added that bit of fun to the journey. Usually one of the group of friends would invent or exaggerate a story about a murder, a flasher or a rabid Alsatian that somebody or other had the unfortunate misfortune to experience whilst walking down the very alleyway we were about to walk down. The alleyway itself was at least half a mile long with thorn bushes lining each side. At about halfway down, someone had erected feather edge board fencing to border their garden and to house a rather vicious dog. As we approached the alley, we all clenched our fists in preparation for any attack that might ensue. I stopped mid stride and pointed out that if it was a rabid Alsatian that made the attack, fists would be useless! However, John Gaffney provided the answer, if Wayne went ahead of us; the smell of his pants would either scare away or indeed attract the dog allowing us to make a hasty escape! Wayne Small for some reason always smelt of excrement, he was like a walking nappy. I pointed out the fact that we would be down wind of Wayne but given the alternative choice would be bearable! Also, given that it would be a sudden and surprising attack on Wayne, the shock may well cause a sudden natural bodily function in the pants area; however the smell could not be any worse than it was now! Despite his usual protests, Wayne went on ahead as instructed. It was David Bevington who suggested we hide in the undergrowth when Wayne was not looking. David had his own affliction to contend with, as most kids do. His particular affliction was a constantly running nose and he always had what we called ""a lime ripple candle"" hanging off the end of his nose. He also had a nasty habit of licking the snot off the end of his nose with an exceptionally long tongue. Nobody ever shared their lunch sandwiches with him!! However, as I recall, David became a big hit with the ladies for some reason a short time later! So, we hid in the undergrowth, Tom Brown who was only a member of our group because he provided the cigarettes. He was allowed to smoke at home so always had a pack of twenty in his pocket. Suddenly and without warning, Tom started screaming like a banshee as if we were being attacked. We all joined in the screaming and on the signal, became silent and stood still, hidden in the brambles. Wayne shouted us, we didnt answer; he became more concerned and ran to where he had last seen us looking back and forth hoping to catch a glimpse of one of us. He called out again, panic tinged in his voice. He came a little way into the undergrowth before we all jumped up from behind a bush, arms waving and screaming loudly. Wayne ran away, terrified that we were every bit the monsters we had talked about before walking down the alleyway. We eventually found Wayne a little way up the alley just around the next bend. In fact we could smell him before we saw him. We all laughed and calmed him down before pushing him ahead of the pack as an attack of some sort was still an option whilst we remained in the alley. We were approaching the feather edge border which told us we were about three quarter of the way along the alleyway. Tom generously crashed the fags but he only had one match to light the cigarette. The pressure was on Tom and he felt our piercing eyes on him. If the match went out before he could light the cigarette he would suffer the disdain of the group. There was no wind so Tom, being the champion lighter of cigarettes even in windy conditions, managed to light our cigarettes. We could see Wayne ahead near the feather edge boards, he did not smoke, but we wished he did as it would have somewhat disguised his unfortunate odour! As Wayne reached the feather edge boards, a huge dog jumped at the fence barking and growling. It was trying to get through the fence at whoever was on the other side. Wayne fell backwards with the shock; water ran from the short leg of his trousers. We laughed of course because we were at a safe distance. Then we could see the dogs paws gripping the top of the boards, trying to pull itself up and over the top to get at whoever had dared to go near his property. Wayne ran off in terror leaving a trail of water behind him. We found him further up the alleyway; he had no trousers or pants on and was cleaning himself up with a huge dock leaf. We all ran past the rabid dog still hanging on the top of the fence and left Wayne alone with his ablutions. We waited at the end of the alleyway and Tom crashed the fags again and we begged a light from a passing pedestrian who was only too pleased to be of help. Wayne joined us a few minutes later followed by a dozen or more blue bottles hoping to feed off his unfortunate event. We arrived at the sports ground and duly reported to Mr. Grimsdyke to check in. He ticked off our names without a spoken word. Wayne approached him and as soon as he uttered his name, Mr Grimsdyke clutched his nose and took Wayne by the left ear directly to Mr. Lewis the history and gym teacher. We saw Wayne get bundled into Mr Lewiss Morris 1000 Traveller car and Mr. Lewis took him off in the car, opening all the windows of the car as he sped away. The event itself went well with me, Julian Race coming second in the javelin, after narrowly missing the judges leg. John Gaffney came second in the sack race, Tom Brown winning the shot put and Wayne, well he arrived at the end and it was the sweetest we had ever smelt him! Mr. Lewis had taken him back to Waynes house where he was made to bathe and change by his mother before being brought back to the event just in time for him to join us in the four mile walk back to school! We had to report to Mr. Grimsdyke before leaving and he congratulated us all on our achievements and told us to report to him as soon as we arrived back at school to ensure we were all safe. We did not think there was anything wrong with that instruction as that is what normally happened on sports day, it was his way of making sure you didnt bunk off early! We arrived back at school earlier than we would normally have done because when we reached the bus stop, Todger Brown who was allegedly attracted to other boys, hence his nick name and of course being the odd brother of Tom was waiting there. The open back double decker bus pulled up and Todger got on, flicking his hair back with a backwards flip of his head as he always did. The bus pulled away and we all jumped on to the platform at the back. Luckily we all managed to stay on for three stops before the conductor noticed us and threw us off for not paying. As we stood on the pavement, Mr. Lewis pulled up in his primrose coloured Morris Traveller and surprisingly offered us all a lift back to school. We all squeezed into the back of the car because as we knew, Mr. Lewis liked to stand and watch the boys go through the showers after a cross country run, we were never sure of him although he was a married man. We arrived back at school and reported to Mr. Grimsdykes office. He hadnt yet arrived back so we waited in the class room. Suddenly the classroom door was kicked open and in walked Iain Ferris and John Joyce the schools best fighters and tough as old boots. They had arrived at the school at the start of the term from another school on the other side of Birmingham (UK). Since starting at the school they had fought their way up through the ranks of school fighters to become the best. They were feared wherever they went. I suddenly had the urge to urinate as Iain stood face to face with me. Julian he said with a smile on his face. Hi Iain I replied wondering why he was calling me by my first name and not Race as was the norm, you OK mate. A dickey bird tells me you play a musical instrument he asked, guitar I hear? Err a bit I said just in case he played guitar as well and did not want to imply I was better than he was. Play me something he said. Sorry Iain, I broke a nail this morning on the javelin, it smarts a bit I said defensively. Ive heard through the grapevine that you are pretty good he said? Who said that Iain, well hes a liar and Ill.. John interrupted and said I did! Well not too bad I said feigning pain from my allegedly broken nail. Grimsdyke plays nursery rhymes to the first year on guitar said Iain and he walked to Mr. Grimsdykes stock room and opened the door. Heres his guitar, play me something. Sensing Iains urgency I told Tom Brown to watch for Mr. Grimsdyke at the door. The three of us, Iain, John and I crowded into the small space of the stock room. I checked the tuning and gave them the full rendition of T Rex, Hot Love with vocal. I looked up from the G chord and Iain and John were smiling. At the end, I put down the guitar and we exited the stock room. Iain then astonished me by asking if I wanted to join his new band as a guitarist. I quickly ran through the pros and cons of the offer in my mind and after thinking of the benefits of having the two best fighters as band mates, I accepted and roped in Tom, Wayne, David and John as the road crew. Mr Grimsdyke came into the room. What do you want Ferris, Joyce? Nothing Sir, were just talking to Julian about band practice. Mr. Grimsdyke looked at them suspiciously and they left. He turned to me, Wayne, Tom, David and John and said right you lot, what the hell gives you the right to stick two fingers up to me when I was on the bus this morning, I want you all to write out one hundred lines after school, he picked up a piece of chalk and wrote on the blackboardTo learn from my mistakes I must write out one hundred times, I must not stick two fingers up to Mr. Grimsdyke. I think of those days sometimes and wonder where all the other people who were in my class are now. A tear comes to my eyes every time as I recall that John Gaffney was killed on his first outing on his 50cc moped, David Bevington drowned in the River Cole after an accident on a cross river swing, he apparently knocked himself out and fell face down in the river, no one else was with him. Tom died of leukaemia at sixteen. Iain lived till he was forty nine and died from a heart attack, Id seen him a week earlier at a restaurant in Alvechurch, he was morbidly obese and I was shocked that such a nice looking lad had changed so much. John Joyce went into the army at seventeen, unable to find work; he was killed in Ireland a couple of years later. Wayne, I lost touch with Wayne after his parents moved away after he finished education. I have just found his name on social media; he died of liver cancer only a few weeks before.  Ill never forget those friends, and Wayne, I can still smell him now! Julian Race 20/06/2021"
"My Garden, My Love","Hello, my name is Jordan, I am a 28-year old whose biggest obsession is his garden. I love flowers, I love helping them grow, taking care of them, and giving them to people who need them. A flower may not seem valuable or a present of huge importance, but then again it all depends on what you consider to be valuable. For me it's the intention behind the flower, the flower simply represents my intentions, for others, a flower may not represent anything, in fact, it might just be meaningless. Then again, if words can change people's lives, a simple act of kindness and compassion might do more, it might change someone's perspective on life, help them solve a big dilemma, empower them to do something they have been avoiding for a long time, and so on. After all, random small strokes can form a beautiful big picture. However, the rarity of something specifically does not make it more special than others, being different or rare alone can make one special, but not more necessarily more special than others. These are the ideals that I gained after a certain incident that happened only two years ago. Every day I used to get up early in the morning, work out, take a shower, have breakfast, and head straight to work. I am a journalist, so I am able to work from home, although sometimes I have to travel, which is not a problem because I'm not away so long that my plants will suffer from it. Once I came back I devoted most of my time to taking care of my garden, I had everything from orchids, to roses, from sunflowers to tulips and dahlias too. It was my little paradise, and I liked to share it with others, so when they were fully grown and I had obtained more of their seeds I would go out and randomly hand out flowers to strangers. I would receive all types of reactions. some were weirded out, some were happy to receive them, some refused to take them, some insisted on paying me for them, and I refused to accept their money, but some of them insisted so much I was forced to take their money. One day I came back from my stroll and I found quite a new sprout growing in the corner of the garden. It looked quite like the roses so I left it alone and tended to it like any other flower, but about a week later I noticed it was different from perfumed roses, or the extravagant tulips, or the shiny sunflowers, or the gorgeous orchids. This flower looked big and it wasn't even close to the climax of its existence, so it had a lot to grow still. At first, I thought that it was quite common and I was just making a big deal out of it, but the more I looked for what it was, the less I found. I spent like this, obsessing over this strange flower growing in my garden for about another week until I found an article online that talked about weird or rather, ""rare"" types of flowers all around the world. I almost had a heart attack when I found out that the ""weird"" flower growing in my garden was none other than the rarest flower in the world, the Middlemist Red. I panicked, I didn't know what to do, I didn't even know if I was taking proper care of it. At one point I considered telling my friends or even saying something on the discord server that other gardeners had formed and I had joined; however, I did not, something stopped me and to this day I am sure that I made the right choice. From that day my life changed, I didn't make a fortune from it or become famous, but I felt blessed for having the opportunity to take care of this wonderful gift. I was in love with this flower now, I thought that taking care of it would be very expensive yet it turned it out, this was not the case at all. Simply watering it and showing the proper love it deserved was enough for it to reach its maximum potential. I was still enticed, it was special, I had a treasure in my garden, and now watering my flowers took a different meaning, it was the best part of my day. As the days passed I fell further and further in love with this wonder and got to see it grow into a majestic masterpiece from which I could take pride saying I nurtured it and helped it grow. More days passed by and I started to notice some plants in my garden were dying, I was a bit shocked but didn't pay much attention to it and kept watering my plants, especially my treasure. Eventually, I stopped going on my strolls to distribute flowers and spending time with my shiny sunflowers, or extravagant tulips, or perfumed roses, or gorgeous orchids, instead I focused solely focused on my Middlemist. A couple of weeks passed and The Middlemist started to die, I got worried, its glow was fading and its life was ending right before me and I didn't know what to do, or even what I had done wrong. After I calmed down and sat down to think I realized that more than half of my garden was dying if not already dead. It hit me that the reason my Middlemist Red was dying was that I ruined the environment, and the reason my garden was dying, was because I wasn't paying enough attention to it. My garden's value was revealed to me that day. Every flower was special to me, all of them from the most common to the Middlemist Red. I worked it thoroughly, I had to take some days off of work but it didn't bother me, this was my priority. Everything worked together, all the flowers, the soil, the water, and the weather were all key components, and each of them individually was special in themselves. The Middlemist Red saw many flowers grow and many more leave the garden, I resumed my strolls and to my surprise many people that I would usually give flowers to asked me how I was and why I had missed so many days of work, on top of that they were happy to see me."
NOW I SEE ME,"...Hes running down the bushy path, screaming and crying at the same time. His throat hurts, his head and legs too, but he doesnt mind. He has to leave where he is right now. He can feel the trees moving with him, and although his mind tells him it is not possible, he chooses to believe it.Run!!He hears his voice giving the instruction and he is even more afraid of what he has become.It is this place. It is making me crazy he thinks but he cant help himself, and he feels he is forever doomed.Melon had never known what it felt like to be alone. The first boy of three kids, he was treated specially albeit differently. He still hears the voicesDont take that path Mel""Why wear that Mel?Thats not safe buddyHe still hears them and even when they turn into tiny whispers, he seeks them. He remembers his childish cry for help even when he was supposed to have left it all behind, acting like a man as he moved away and began working for the Tech Company they got him.I dont know what to do MumDo you think I should take that?""""I am a little bit confusedPainfully he knew better but he couldnt bring himself to let go. Deb warned him.You act too dependent. Stop it for a second pleaseHe remembers her pleading eyes. He remembers the tears she cried, and he also remembers the hurt he saw as she left his apartment never to return. She had not been the first, but he had hoped she would be the last. He had loved her, and he had wanted to stop but like oxygen, he was sure he couldnt live without their support.The thoughts roam around his head as the chase continues. He can see them everywhere. They hated him and he knew why. There was no doubt that the moment they as much as laid a finger on him, he would not survive their haunt. So he runs faster. He must get to the house. He must get in and stay even if for a second, he knows the difference it will make.Who are you Melon? his college professor had asked him some years back.Im a man who has a good family and is working to make them proudThe professor had frowned his face and adjusted his glasses. He seemed unsatisfied with the answer and remained quiet for some minutes leaving Mel uncomfortable in his seat.Mel- the Professor spoke more quietly as if to himself.You see, I did not ask you what you have and what youve been up to currently. I only asked- who are you?He stared at Mel directly this time as if daring him to repeat the same answer. Mel more confused than he was some minutes ago when he was summoned into the Professors office, looked down at his shoes and kept quiet. Nearing a minute, he spokeHmm..."" He sputters. ""I will have to think about a better answer that will be more suitable for you sir he replied timidly.Just then the professor stood up and walked over to him, placing his hands on Mels shoulder.Remember not to ask anyone but yourself, he said and opened the door signifying that he was done with him.Mel knew his time with the professor was over, but he could not understand the strangeness of the meeting. From then on, he had avoided the professor as best as he could, not knowing what other answer to give him, but he remained plagued by the question- who are you?As he ran now, the question came to him. He mocked himself at the thought of his shallow answer. He mocked his inability to even give a better answer two years after.Thinking hard now, he was certain that the question was the only secret he had kept from them and he knew why. For a personal question as this was, they would give him the answer and make him feel it was his answer. The irony of it all made him scream even louder and blinded him from seeing the big stump of a tree that was blocking the road ahead of him.His huge self fell forward. He felt a sharp pain in his head first. Without looking he knew it was a thorn that had pierced his skin. The next pain he felt was his knees. He tried to get up, but it was hard. His trouser was stuck on the stump. It was torn, but not just that, the stump had scratched his leg and reopened the wound he had the previous week from mowing the compounds lawn where he was a tenant.With new pains on his body, he continued running. He was close to the house now. He could see the roof with the aid of the sprouting moon. From the look of it, he knew it was a full moon coming but he was not perturbed by it. He just needed to get to the house. It was safe. They would help him. They loved him, but more importantly, he needed them. He needed them so much that the thought of him not reaching the house was enough to kill him right then. He screamed, but this time it was not in fear.Just as he was about to take another step forward, a few metres from the compound, he saw the silhouettes of two figures standing side by side looking at him from the balcony.At first, he thought his mind was playing the usual trick on him because he did not doubt that if the figures were who he suspected them to be, they would come running once they saw him as he saw them.Unsure what their stillness meant, he decided to stop running. He maintained his stare as they did theirs and he was sure what he saw. It was just the two of them, and they had begun laughing, they pointed at him simultaneously but they werent running towards him.They knew it was him just as he knew it was them. Looking on painfully, he realized the truth. He was just a pawn to be played with.Without another thought, he turned back and ran even faster to those he was running from. He would let them put their claws in him. He understood their angry voices now. The words they spoke were no longer strange to him. He felt his heart tear in two at the thought of the two whom he thought loved him. He was ashamed of the years he spent believing all the lies they told. Now he was certain hed be able to answer the professors question. Mel woke up with a start to the noise of pots and pans. It was the same dream he had since he stopped communicating with his parents a year ago. He stared at his wet bedsheets and rubbed his hands on his sweaty skin. He couldnt help being sad remembering what life used to be for him while he let his parents control his life. He was free now but he was still haunted by the experience.As he tried to sit on the medium-sized bed he recently got upon Hannah moving in with him, he got a wisp of the regular pancake aroma that he frequently woke up to in the mornings. He knew Hannah had begun making breakfast, and he couldnt wait to taste it.He stepped into the bathroom to relieve himself and like was his routine in the morning, he opened the big cabinet hung on the wall to reveal a big mirror taped round at the back. He wanted to have a fresh look at himself before he began the day.There he was facing the mirror, looking at his 32-year-old self and loving his reflection. He was not the same man he was two years ago. Now he could answer the Professors question.Still staring at his reflection as if not knowing the man he looked at, he spoke out loud.I am a man of myself, created by God to do His will. I now see me the way he made me. Its not about what I have, its all about who God is and how much he loves me. I like what I see. Now I see me.With that, he walked off to the kitchen where Hannah his wife was, humming his favourite song."
WHAT IS ICE CREAM?,"There once was a little boy who had trouble understanding the meaning of words. His dad explained that he needed to know what the word meant to understand it, but all this did was make him more confused.The next day, they were sitting at dinner when his mom said, Im going to get up and clear my plate.Clear your plate? What does that mean? he asked his dad. He told me about how she would take her dish over and put it in the sink so no one else could use it. I think I might be starting to get the hang of this language, thought the little boy as soon as he understood what clear your plate meant. That night, the boy was going to bed when his dad said, Im going to get up and tuck you in.Tuck me in? What does that mean? he asked, confused. He told him how he would cover him with a blanket and kiss him goodnight, so the dark wouldnt bother him. This time it took longer for the little boy to understand what that meant. But after hearing his mother talking about washing, he started putting two and two together. Now, if youll excuse me, I have some socks that need cleaning.I have a surprise for you, said Dad one morning. Were going to go to the beach tomorrow.The little boy was thrilled and asked, Whats that?That is where we throw things into the ocean.A few days later, they went back to the beach. The little boy picked up some rocks and threw them in - one by one, he could make ripples! He asked, What are those?Dad smiled at him as if it should be obvious and said, Those are waves.Later on that week, during dinner time, Dad said: You know how you love to eat ice cream? Well, I have something even better for you! Tomorrow I am going to take you to get ice cream!The little boy was so excited; he couldnt wait. He asked excitedly, What is ice cream?That..., said Dad, pausing to think about how to explain the flavour of ice cream to a child. Well, thats what happens when you mix chocolate and milk.The boys mind raced, trying to make sense of the new words. Mix chocolate and milk? he repeated slowly.Thats right! beamed Dad excitedly, glad that his son was finally getting the idea.Then what happens? What does it look like? asked the boy.Dad was confused by that question, but answered it anyway: It looks like something you want to eat!The boys eyes lit up, and he said excitedly, I know! It looks like glurp.What? asked his dad, now thoroughly confused.Like when I mix orange juice with strawberry milk! explained the little boy. His father sighed in relief and said: Thats right! Ice cream is what happens when you mix chocolate and milk.Oh yeah, I remember now, said the boy. Thats what we call glurp.Every morning, the boy woke up excited about what new combination of words he would hear that day. One Saturday, he was outside playing when suddenly his dad walked out and said, How would you like some ice cream? The little boy looked at him suspiciously and asked: What is ice cream?His father chuckled to himself and said, Ice cream is a delicious frozen dessert made from milk and sugar!The boy shrugged his shoulders and said, Okay...A few minutes later, Dad brought out a plate with a slice of cake on it. The boy watched in amazement as the man took out a can, shook it till something came out, and then sprayed the cake with a fine mist. What is that? asked the boy as he watched Dad sprinkle the white covering all over the cake, covering every inch of it.Its called ice cream, replied his dad, smiling at him proudly. The boy scooped up some of the stuff on his plate and said:I know! It looks like glurp.What? His father leaned forward, interested in what the little boy had to say about this frozen dessert hed made for him.The little boy looked up at his dad, smiled, and said: Thanks for letting me try some glurp!Its called ice cream, repeated his father patiently.He looked up at his dad and said, I know! It looks like glurp.The little boy grew older and learned that the world was a wondrous place. He delved deeper into learning how things were named, where they came from, what they tasted like. But there were still some things he didnt understand. His mother was ill for quite some time, and nobody told him why she had to go to the hospital or what happened there when she died of cancer. But as he got older, he learned about it all on his own: pain, suffering, death. But even then, he struggled with understanding this strange concept known as death.When the boy was in the third grade, his language arts teacher asked him to write a composition on what he wanted to be when he grew up. The little boy scratched away with his pencil and, when he had finished, showed it to his father. It said:I want to be an explorer like my dad! I want to find out things that nobody else knows about. I hope one day I can discover new words for other people to learn to understand them too!I love glurp.His father smiled at his work - Thats wonderful! he exclaimed. The boy grinned back as if pleased by the compliment. His mother walked up beside him and read what her son had written. She looked up at her husband and tilted her head in confusion. What is this? she asked, pointing to the paper.The boy quickly provided his answer: Thats what it looks like when you mix chocolate and milk! We call it glurp!No dear, his father corrected him gently, its called ice cream, not glurp. The boy looked at his mother, then back down at the paper, with a look of confusion on his face. He could see that it said glurp! It must be glurp! Glurp tastes good...why would anyone want to call something else by that name?His parents exchanged glances and realized their mistake. They had gone and told their son about this wonderful frozen dessert they loved so dearly, and called it by the wrong name. The boy was too young to understand what ice cream was. And, in time, he would learn the horrible truth: that glurp is a sickly brown liquid created from mixing chocolate syrup and milk.He would grow into adulthood as a man who could not understand how his parents loved something so vile (as glurp used to be). But more importantly, hed never see glurp as anything but... well, glurp.On second thought, maybe Ill stick with calling it ice cream."
"When I Became Death, I Finally Felt Alive","Please let me die, I said, staring up at the ceiling with my wrists bound to the hospital gurney. Tears had pooled in my eyes; and my death ended up being as monumental as the word sorry. Apologies were passed around in small groups, sorry was given and taken to family and friends, and then like a regret pushed down deep, it was moved away from. My death came and went and my family and former life had to move on too. I had expected no less.  Please let me die! I had sobbed, uncurled on my bedroom floor, chest heaving and mouth spread with teeth and spit. The pain thrumming in my head so hard that I could feel the veins pushing against the skin. The empty bottles, fallen allies; and the arms that caught me up and squeezed me tight were only the traps that would later pin me to a bed. I had been forced to lay for days on end, my soul bare to the world and a thin apron covering my form.  It was the obituary for my suicide.  When the time did come, it felt like release. I do not mean to romanticise, nor do I wish to horrify the experience. It was neither good nor bad, my act neither moral or immoral, it simply came like the first cold breeze of winter, with a fall.  My death was painful but quick, nothing for the history books but a young teen doing as many had done before her; taking her life to save herself.  The concrete had been cold when I woke on it; not unforgivingly so, as it had just caught me up in its arms, but solid and wanting. It gave me a hand to my feet as I saw the world around had been sapped like the juice being sucked from an ice-pop, subdued and colourless.  Death had not looked as I had expected. Perhaps not what you would have expected either? He was, in a word, a farmer.  His rough hands rested on jean overall covered hips, and an old cap hid his eyes from the world, having been pulled down low long ago. His face was wrinkled as you might expect Deaths to be, but not from age as much as weather worn, cracking from a sunburnt life. He gave a sigh at seeing me rise, and a shake of the head which caused my teeth to grit and bitterness to coat my throat.  Well you done it now, he had said, spitting to the ground, and raising a hand for me to take. Youll let me go? Please, just let me- but he hadnt allowed the words to finish in my mouth before he had taken a firm grip of my chin, his fingertips pressed deep into the skin.Now listen here, you got two options, ones like you dont always mean to go out so quick, some regret it, some dont. If youd like I can give you a new meaning, something beyond living or dying, but no take backs this time. My chin had then been released and the bow of the cap looking at me had given a nod.  Its been a 1,000 years since then, and I dont miss my life one bit. I have missed one thing though; and this one thing comes when the nights get long and the deaths lull. He is called Shivam, and he is a Breath-Giver, a Soul-Bringer. Life.  We met on a wet Wednesday afternoon in Toronto, a deer had been hit by a driver. I had stood at the side of the road, the red tail lights of the car gleaming over the beasts sodden body. Its chest had heaved painfully. Breaths coming wheezy and slow. I remember sighing before I saw him, readying my hand to help the does head and shoulders rise from its corpse when I saw its stomach twist oddly. The fawn was born soaked in afterbirth and its mothers blood and took me amusingly by surprise.  Please, let me? A voice had asked just as I had been considering to help the new born meet its mother, perhaps not in a way either had intended, but stopped at this voice. A young man of Indian decent was stood next to me. Slightly taller than I was, in jeans and old converse, he was lanky and bemused. Drifting his hand downward I watched for the first time a soul being pushing into a body. It was a tender action, soft and subtle like a fish slipping into water. And then the fawn had taken its first breath, and I had met my match.  I dont think you can just take one of the dead from me, I had said, a small rise tugging to the corner of my mouth. Its not yours if its breathing. You know, I dont think it was before you got here. We had smiled then at one another, and I realised that I didnt mind the company.  Life and Death do not stick together like glue, we have to circle one another like the sun and moon, only getting brief eclipses to languish in company. We sometimes take this time to talk, to walk; our most common destinations were bridges it seems, often over lakes or ponds, and mainly at night. Sometimes we sat on bridges and laughed till the time came for us to part; else wed simply follow one another for a short time in the others shadowed duties.  Shivam had a teacher too once, a wild 30 year old woman with skin as dark as coffee and humour just as bitter. He had said she often liked to slap him on the back just as a soul was placed, and laugh at the new soul being dropped into the world with a start. We visited her a long time ago, when the sun was hot and the desert was such a bright gold you would have thought you were stood upon the sun. We walked and watched as she brought tumbles of sand spiders into the world all at once, and then would teased at our companionship fondly.  You ought to be off now, she had made a shooing motion and I had only grinned in response, walking closer. I could see the tiredness around her eyes and suddenly I felt it, the passing. She seemed to have known it was coming too, and rested her weight on me, allowing my hand to hold her arm. Is it time now? I think so. She looked worried for a moment, regret and longing looking back over her long, long life. Please, let me? And she fell into my grasp as light and easy as soft snow fluttering apart. Her passing affected Shivam greatly, and it soon came time for my teacher to come to me also. Its time, he had stated, his hat giving me a weary look, before a sunburnt arm was raised for me to take. I took a firm grip of his hand, allowing the callouses to cut into my skin. Soil smudged from his fingertips to mine, and I took some of his weight by catching up his elbow in my other hand. Its a long hard job, and you best remember it aint pretty work. His voice had been as sombre as ever and all I could give in return was a sarcastic  A smile caught at my lips, and for the first time since out meeting the tip of his cap had risen, and underneath, the stars of a thousand souls had glinted back.  Many years passed with ease, the job palatable and the company good. I watched Shivam grow old in servitude. His work became rigorous; and Life became serious.  But soon the time came when I smiled upon a soul that had met its time to pass, and I gave it a choice instead.  Fancy meeting someone all the way out here? Say, you wouldnt happen to be looking for a another adventure would you? The astronaut at the time hadnt found my humour in the matter, more a perplexity in the situation of a young girl with wildness in her eyes and a loose t-shirt crouched next to him on a planet far from earth. But as I had hoped he took my hand and I led him astray, into the world of Life-Stealing, Soul-Taking, Peace-Giving. Death.  Shivam didnt find his replacement for many years. Not because he didnt want to I dont think, but because Life was ever present, ever growing, and he chose to fill his hands with the management of it all rather than tutelage.  Please, I had almost begged many a time, wanting certain creatures to take his place, to bring into our profession, to bring companionship to us. But he knew better. A new Life was not for us, for our enjoyment, but for the betterment of everything. And it took me by surprise when one autumn day he looked to the dying body of an old Mexican woman and asked me, please. I took her soul from her body as quickly as breath from lips and gave him his pupil. I gave him a grandmother who would tenderly follow in his footsteps for hundreds of years to come.  Joy then laughter came back into his life once Old Rosa took in his stead; and more than once he commented on the galaxies than now swam in our eyes like the sands of time filling us up. Our end stretched out then came close all at once. Like the fall of a rain drop. Or the crash of a body to concrete.  We held hands and when the time came I ask, please, let us die, to my astronaut. And our souls finally left the world together, in friendship, and at peace."
The Boy Under The Bridge,"The scullery maid placed a tray on the table with a glass of milk and a plate of clairs. They looked absolutely delicious; large as a rolled-up fist and almost spilling over with cream.  Go on, help yourself. You must be hungry. My blood sweat and tears went into those clairs and besides, the time for rest has come. The maid said with a knowing smile. Timmy found the comment rather odd but was far too hungry to protest. The most decent meal he had in the last couple of days was a moldy piece of bread hed wrestled from a roof rat the size of a cat. The clairs on the other hand were fresh, warm, and all his.He grabbed one and bit into it, the creamy center melting onto his tongue with a smooth familiar taste. Buttercream Timmy exclaimed shoving the rest of the clair into his mouth. I love buttercream.  The maid chuckled, pushing the plate closer to the boy as he smiled in grateful bliss. The young sir loved it too, God rest his soul. The maid did a weird cross sign across her chest and grabbed an clair as well. Then she watched Timmy eat for quite some time without saying a word. When he finally managed to ignore the womans strange tendencies, he munched through half the plate, savoring each bite as if it would be his last.  For all Timmy knew, it would be. He dreaded the return to that heap under the bridge, to hunger and loneliness. Where was his mother and what was taking Tommy and his father so long to find them? They needed to leave this place as soon as possible, go far away and never return. The watchmen had invaded and poisoned the city. It was no longer the paradise it once was. Not too fast now, you dont want to choke. The maid said as she poured Timmy a glass of warm milk and pushed it towards him. There there, eat up. A growing boy must have all that he can eat while he still has his teeth. She went on with a squeaky chuckle as Timmy nodded, took the glass, and drank. Ever since he had arrived, Timmy had gradually dispelled the rumors of House Lanka. Old as the building was, it hardly seemed haunted. If anything, it was warm, clean, and smelled of baked goods and clean beddings. It smelled just like home. The mourning maid of House Lanka was also furthest from the figure spoken of in the stories. Yes, she had soot on her face, bloodshot eyes, and crooned under her shoal, but she was kind and very much human.  Ghosts couldnt after all bake cookies and pour milk.  If only Timmy had known, hed have come here soon after the raid instead of huddling under that moss-ridden cold rock. His hope now was that she would help him find his mother, wherever she had gone. And when youre done, well get you out of those dirty old rags and into some clean pajamas and socks. A boy like you shouldnt have to sleep on the streets when there are so many rooms in House Lanka. The Lord would not want that. The maid went on, securing her nightgown. Who is the Lord of House Lanka? Timmy asked through a mouthful of chewed cookies.  Lord Sospeter Lanka of course, She replied, then her countenance fell. Though as you may already know, things have since changed after the raid and the house is not as it used to be. The maid added and something about how she said it sent a cold shiver through Timmys body.  He did not know why. Why do you say that? Timmy asked warily.He did not wish to delve into the true horrors he knew lay behind the stories, yet still, something pulled him to know more about the house, about the Lankas. Dont mind the mumbling of a sleep-deprived woman. The maid added with a kind smile. Go on, eat. Normal as she seemed, Timmy still thought her a rather peculiar young woman. For one, she had spotted him sleeping under the abandoned toll bridge. Timmy did not know how, for he had always made it a point to squeeze past the cavern in the wall next to the dry river bed to allow his mother space in front of him.  There, under the collapsed stones, Timmy knew that even the rabid stray dogs could not get through to bite him. Nobody who passed there ever saw him for his mother had made sure he was well hidden and unseen, most of all from the watchmen of the city. Yet somehow this woman had found him. How? After he had finished his eclairs and milk, Timmy gave a satisfied belch, embellished by the maids chuckle. Excuse me. He blushed. You are excused, she said with a giggle, A most glorious sound to hear  The maid added stacking the dishes onto the tray. Shall I get you some more? Her eyes, round and glossy under the yellowish glow of candelabras beckoned him to say yes. However, sense told him to wait, to be careful.  He still did not know why the old woman was being so kind to him. Did she work for the watchmen now that the house obviously belonged to another? Would she turn him and his mother in if she knew they were on the run?  If she did, it would undo his fathers sacrifice as well as that of his brother. Suddenly his appetite waned. No thank you, maam. Im famished. I should be going now, mama will be worried if she returns and doesnt find me. The woman giggled delightedly as she cleared the tray. Rest will do you better young sir, then in the morrow, we shall go to seek her out. It is not safe outside at this time, more so for a young boy. She said as she walked gracefully towards the kitchen; almost floating. Where are we going? Timmy asked wiping his hands on his ripped trousers. Well to take a nice hot bath of course and then off to bed. The maid added walking away. Bed? Timmy asked perplexed. A bed; like food, seemed like a thing heard of yet seldom familiar at this point. However, sleep sounded like a comforting thing after such a lovely meal and such a long long time in the cold. Hesitant, Timmy followed silently. The grand foyer outside the living room shone bright with candlelight, its polished mahogany walls plastered with hundreds of portraits. The portraits climbed all the way up, disappearing beyond the reach of candlelight. In all of them were the same distinguished-looking people, Lankas probably; the first targets of the watchmen. Whos this? Timmy asked eyeing a particularly tall black-haired boy with creamy white skin. He reminded him somewhat of his older brother Tommy. Timmy wondered if he and his father were still alive but stopped immediately he felt his throat constrict.  There was no need to hope for what he knew wasnt possible. He could not get back to the city anyway, especially not without his mother.  Death awaited them there. Timmys father had warned them against going back when he sent them away. Timmy hated the thought of leaving his brother behind, but Tommy would not leave their fathers side. Take care of mama for us wont you. Tommy had said. , Timmy thought, having no idea where she was. He had only shut his eyes for what seemed a second and when he awoke he was alone in the cavern. Where had she gone? Why had she gone and left him alone? Did she not care what happened to him? Had they not lost enough already?  she had whispered before he slept Timmy nodded and obeyed, so why did she still leave him?  His mother had made that promise, but it had been months now and Timmy was still alone. Why? Had she lied? Had something happened to papa and Tommy to her? Had she abandoned him and fled alone?   What? the maid asked turning. This boy Timmy added pointing to the portrait. Who is he?  She squinted in the direction of his finger smiling. Ah yes, the young master, such a darling he was. She surveyed the other people in the portrait.  Unfortunate thing what happened to them all. The maid said with a sigh. What do you mean what happened to them? Timmy asked feeling the hairs at the back of his neck prickle.  Her eyes were somber, looming in the darkness. Its nothing to concern you with now; a sad story with an even sadder ending. She said heading towards the kitchen. Now wait here for me while I get the keys for the upstairs rooms. Im certain I put them somewhere in here. She mumbled disappearing down the hall, leaving Timmy alone with the ghosts of House Lanka the ghosts of his past. He had heard the gruesome tale, though he wished for his sake, like the house and the maid, that it was all untrue. They captured and tortured Lord Lanka to reveal the whereabouts of the rest of his family and shot the young master in the back when the Lord refused. Then they dragged him across town naked, chained to their horses until they found his wife. The Lady Lanka was spotted under the bridge and was chased and murdered at the stroke of midnight, shot as she ran towards the wheat fields. Thereafter she was mauled by the watchmens dogs and left to bleed to death. Fortunately, there was no sign of the young sir whom the townsfolk say managed to escape. The carnage that ended an entire line played over in Timmys mind. In his head there was more; a blast like a wildfire from ignited gun powder to weed Lady Lanka out. She ran even though Lord Lanka shouted for her to comply.  She did it to protect the young sir. He imagined the sound of the blast, the crumbling of rocks, Lord Lanka, driven into a mad rage, pummeled with gun powderAgain Timmy stopped himself from thinking. It was too painful, too sad a story to imagine right now. He needed to keep his spirits up, gain his strength, sleep, then rouse to find his mother in the morrow. If papa and Tommy said they would come, then they would. He was sure of it. He and his family would escape to the country, to peace and an end to war. Timmy returned his attention to the portraits. Now that he was looking at them, they did not seem quite as frigid and beastly as the watchmens tales described. Mrs. Lanka for instance seemed a lot fairer than Nick the butchers boy had said she looked, familiar even, as did the Lord and young master. How odd, Timmy thought.  He was far too young to have ever her he did not remember seeing any of the Lankas portraits anywhere in the city. Besides, they were far too distinguished and important to matter to a boy like him. A boy like him who was he after all? Was he a butchers boy like Nick? What was it that his father did again? Was his brother in the army? His head started to hurt as he thought and he stopped, returning his attention to the portrait of Lady Lanka. Surely she was far too tall, slender, and stunning to have ever graced Timmys ancestors quarters. Would his grandmother have been noble enough to host her? What did his mother even do come to think of it? His head throbbed again and he stopped his train of thought. Instead, he paid attention to Lady Lankas long flowing black hair, her big beautiful brown kind eyes, and and wait a minute.  Timmy moved closer to the portrait and stared. There between Lord Lanka, Lady Lanka and the young master was a short skinny looking boy he was quite sure was no, it couldnt be. These portraits had to have been done ages ago, even before his parents were born, before the war that began his days under the abandoned bridge. So why was there a young boy in the Lanka portrait who looked just like him? A jangle of keys in the hallway drew him away from his thoughts. Here we go. The keys to the bedrooms the maid said no, not a maid, not a random maam either. Looking closely at the woman who emerged from the darkness beyond, he saw her as if for the very first time. She was tall, slender, and stunning with long flowing black hair and big kind knowing eyes. Maam Mama? The woman headed towards the stairs with a jug in her hand and a wide smile. Come along Timmy, the waters still nice and hot and you must rest. Mama? Timmy said still rooted to the spot. Yes, my boy? She asked smiling in his direction. It did not make sense to Timmy what had just happened, yet somehow, strangely, it still did.  Then it dawned on him. Am I dead? Are  dead? Is papa is Tommy? She held her smile for a moment, though it faltered with time. The truth it seemed was too painful for even her to ignore. Come it is time to sleep and papa and Tommy await you. The chill returned to Tommys body, now filling every inch of him as the room shimmered away, bringing him back to the cavern in the wall by the river bed. He hesitated, but for the first time since his death, Timmy embraced his grave, calming in its eternal lullaby."
Where Cherries Grow (Ukrainian Anecdote),"Where Cherries Grow (Ukrainian anecdote)In the days of the childhood, I was often left to spend a month or two of summer time in the house of my grandparents. They lived in a sleepy Ukrainian town on the cherry covered shore of the river that cuts the country on two on its grand way to the sea. Those long evenings under the cherries smelled candies, the glowing bugs flew overhead and among looking them up, illuminated by the glow faces of the kids there was mine and of my two brothers too. Next to our house was a park that everyone called sadok, the Ukrainian for a garden, - a verdant place with goats tied to the tree trunks. We kids fed them with the fresh leaves and later drunk their hot milk from the aluminum mugs held for us by the worn-out hands of war widows that owned the goats. The cherry trees in sadok were of all sorts and gave the fruits of all sizes, colors and tastes. Their friendly branches invited to climb and were so comfortable that we slept up there often, safe and cozy on their polished by our elbows and knees wide boughs. On the other side of sadok was the bakery. Rows of the cooling down, just baked loafs of bread seemed to be only a stretch of a hand away from the fence as we stayed on the other side of it and breathed in their hot and sweet flavor. Farther down, behind the bushes, was the factory hostel where women workers had their lodgings. Hiding in those bushes from the hostile party of other boys we saw the women running up and down the stairs of the entrance and that view was as common and uninteresting as the passage of the clouds in the sky. A few other characters, as well as cats and dogs with names were the regular passersby through sadok. There was a man, an invalid of war or of some accident, we didnt know. Walking heavily, hed stop to watch us for a while before tottering farther by the swaying, concave path with high grass on both sides. One especially long evening, too tired to play anymore, as the bunch of dropped ripe cherries we were lying on the grass under the trees and watched the stars, when in the silence we heard the sounds of the heavy breathing that was coming from the bushes. Curiously were approached. At one of the holes in fence there stayed the old man. His looking up with widely open mouth face was lit by the light that came from the windows of the hostels second floor where behind the curtains could be seen the silhouettes of people. The man hungrily watched their moves and, his hands, deep between his legs, rhythmically shook. The oldest of us, the neighboring boy, to whose presence in sadok our grandma always frowned, picked up the stone and threw at the man. The breathing stopped, but then began again. The boy picked up another stone and this time we joined him. I barely understood what was happening. Under the hail of stones, quietly sobbing, the old man picked up his sack and hobbled through the bushes away My heart was yet booming as the big orchestral drum when we returned home. The grandma immediately sensed the unusual and, having the extraordinary intuition, an investigative talent as grandpa was putting it, knew everything at once. We were sent to beds but couldnt sleep and for a long time heard behind the wall the hum of the intense conversation between grandparents.Morning greeted us not only by the bright sun but by the delicious smell of the pastry coming from the kitchen. Soft and sleepy, we pushed each other to get in there first. Grandma stood on our way  it is not for you. Then came grandpa. He was wearing a suit with war medals pinned to its lapels. He studied our faces it seemed for eternity, and then said: We are going to have a trip  And no sadok for three days. After the breakfast grandma went away and came back wearing striy (Ukrainian womens dress) of black and red. Shining brown noses of the laced boots were sticking from under the long skirt and on her head was her best hustka (shawl). Lets go they said and so we went, in a procession, grandfather in suit, grandma with pastry swathed in the snow-white cloth, and behind them solemn us, me and my brothers - six green from antiseptic knees. When we walked the hot sun reflected from grandpas medals right into our eyes every time when he turned to look at us. It dimly played on grandmas boots. People greeted us for everyone knew everyone. Then the big black car, the only vehicle in town, that belonged to the secretary of the Party Committee passed us and stopped softly ahead. The rear window rolled down just as we reached the car.Good health, Volodymyr Efroiymovitch!, the voice came from the invisible man inside.Good health, Petro Ivanovitch!, answered grandpa.Having a stroll?Yes, Petro Ivanovitch, having a stroll, it is a beautiful day. We were all sweating. For a few moments no one said a word.But say, Elizaveta Hurievna, the voice eventually broke the silence, do you still have that bottle of cherry vodka, that you promised to keep just for me?After slightly too long a pause grandma said in a cheerful manner: O, Petro Ivanovitch, now when you opened our secret, I dont know if it will last till your next visit and she comically glanced at grandpa.The voice turned to cough, that apparently meant laugh. Then it stopped. Good day, blankly came from inside and the window rolled up. We stood for a while watching the car slowly moving awayAs we resumed our walk, grandma leaned on her husband and he tenderly covered her shoulder with his big palm. The houses ended and the potato fields began. There, in a cabin at the edge of the woods the old man from sadok lived. As we approached it, grandma pulled a black subject from the pocket in her skirt, yarmulke, and placed it on the grandpas head. He carefully adjusted it and reassuringly smiled to us, lets go.The dog on the chain threw a bark, loud enough for the owner to hear. The door of the cabin cracked opened. The old man came out, squinting at us against the bright sun. He recognized the grandpa and grandma and then looked pass them, at us. Still holding the handle of the door as if willing to close it at once, he lowered his eyes and gravely stared at the ground in front of him.Good health, Yosip Yosipovitch! was a friendly voice of grandpa.Good health He looked up intensely and then lifted his free hand to cover his eyes.Yosip Yosipovitch, dont you want to try my pirozhki, I was said they taste good, right boys? said grandma with a little bow.We didnt eat them yet, grimly said Vovka, my stepbrother. The old man advanced and took the parcel from her hands without looking at her. Grandpa cleared his throat and said: Yosip Yosipovitch, Id like to have a word with youThey went inside, and we, grandma, us and dog remained motionless outside. We heard the voice of grandpa, strict, then less, a stifled crying of the old man. It lasted pretty long, then the door opened and they went out. The old mans face was red. He was still holding to the parcel, never let it go. Grandpa and grandma exchanged a quick look mixed with the smile. Granma said: Look, Yosip Yosipovitch, we live in one town but you never visit us. Please come! You and my husband must share so much memories as you were almost in the same unitWe were on the different fronts!yelled grandpa, pretended to be hurt by such gross estimation. The old man smiled to this exchange and said quietly:I will, thank youForgive us suddenly said Vovka, and grandma placed her hand on his head Forgive us... I echoed.We went home the way we came, in a procession, but there was no heavy load on any of us anymore. Grandpa carried his head high as if yarmulke, that grandma hid again, was still on it, and we were marching behind, kicking each other and playing ball with the rotten plums, accustomed to the fact that the next three days well have to spend in the company of the puppies that our dog Pingo had just given birth to.In three days, we were allowed to go to sadok again. Apprehensively we stepped under the nearest row of cherries and played there the whole day. But when the evening came, we went deeper and found ourselves near the fence of the hostel. Behind the curtains of the lit windows there could be seen the figures of women. I looked at my brothers. They watched them too. VR"
Biscuits,"I don't turn on the radio when I drive. I don't listen to books or podcasts. There are some things I might like to hear to help wile away the time and make it more pleasant. Instead I sit in silence. My thoughts are all I hear. Some days it might be better to listen to the radio, to hear the bland and cloyingly gaudy pop come from my crystal clear speakers that probably cost me an extra few hundred. Some days anything is preferable to silence. But I've found silence has a voice. Silence speaks. I try to listen. Even if what it says is the opposite of what I wasor even needto hear.Anger used to burn the house. It branded it. The invisible welt was as red as cherry candy and stung like a sand wasp; itching, irritating, and feeling like it would never let go. Another thing I've learned is that things can heal if you leave them alone long enough. But then again, some are like an allergy, flaring up the moment you come into contact with what hurt you.The drive was fine, I say. I do not mention that I could have crashed while I tried to swim free of the water in my eyes. We do not mention these things. At least I don't.Home is an odd word, so heavily loaded with connotation it's a wonder it hasn't buckled and snapped under the pressure. But then again, home is supposed to stand a lot of pressure. There's not much use of it otherwise.I walk into the kitchen. My eyes instinctively go to the biscuit jar. Its not a jar. Its a ceramic Noahs Ark, just big enough to fit about twelve biscuits. Some homes have a cookie jar. We don't.It is empty. This disappoints me bitterly, and I sit down, dejected. It's kind of funny, the little things that can break a guy.I tried to make biscuits once. I ended up adding too much baking soda and they had been spoiled. No one in my house believed in waste and so they had been eaten. Every single one. My siblings had complained then and laughed long and loud when they recalled it now.Now Im cursed. My sensitivity to the stuff is far beyond that of mere mortals. I can tell you if theres too much of it in your cookies a mile off. I can sniff the improper quantity from any mixture. Some people call me ridiculously sensitive. But I impolitely push my plate away and refuse another bite with an air of dignified politeness.We sit in silence. But like I said, silence can speak. Sometimes silence shouts. If I could I would shout back. But I cant, so we just sit. Memories float around my head. Little snippets of conversation gabble on.Its amazing how much I can remember verbatim. Down to the shape of the voices as they twist and twirl, trying to get in a wounding blow.I cant stand it after a while. Its too hard to pretend Im too tired to do anything else. I am tired. I am so tired it rather surprises me that I can walk with all the weight strapped to my chest. I excuse myself and go upstairs. The last golden red hands have stopped reaching across the sky, driven back by a cold grayness that matches my emotionless emotions.I try to sleep, but sleep seems busy somewhere else. I could try to distract myself with my phone, but somehow it doesnt seem worth the effort. Tonight is a night of quiet. I wont be disturbing it.Hours pass and nothing happens except an unquiet spreads through my bones. I try breathing deeply. I shift around.I will not be sleeping tonight.I creep downstairs, looking for something, Im not quite sure what. I end up in the kitchen, and sit on the floor. Some say that the kitchen is the center of the home. I believe them. So much happened here. Some good, some bad. Its the hearth of our home. I like to think Hestia would like to come here sometimes. I look at the biscuit jar and my mouth sours.I find I am hungry. This makes sense as I havent had dinner.It takes just a minute to find everything. Things have been moved around a bit, but most things are in basically the same places. The baking soda is still marked with a red sharpie. This might have made me laugh in another life.The rolling board is clean.I mix and measure, carefully, my old shame insistent that I dont mess this up. Its incredible that the old thing is still legible, but I have this recipe memorized. The one change I make is to add a pinch less soda. No one will notice. But I can tell.I was never as good as her. She had a gift, nurtured through the years. I didn't. Though through much practice I mastered a few tricks, I resigned myself to a fate of mediocrity in that realm. It was the butter that was the real trick. It would always stick to the knife, and then melt later from being too warmed in my hands. She could always briskly whisk it away with quick movements between her thumb and palm, always perfect, as if it was a thing that took barely any effort.I let them rise a little longer to balance for the baking soda. I dont mind waiting. Ive waited a long time already. An extra hour means nothing. Theres no point in holding onto time. We all get our measure.I contemplate the reason Im here. Its odd the way death pulls people together. The few funerals Ive gone to seem more like a reunion than a ceremony to honor the dead. He wouldnt want to be honored though. He would wish only for a nod of recognition and a smile laced with irony. He used to say he wanted his grave to say . I doubt his headstone will be like that. Theyll probably borrow some Hallmarkian proverb devoid of both meaning or heartfelt anything. Then again, that might make him laugh. Insincerity was his favorite joke.The rising done, I pull out the old wooden rolling pin. The rolling seems therapeutic, like rocking a baby, something I havent done in years and miss. Sometimes I roll the dough like a slow song, reveling in the beautiful mundanity of it. Sometimes I dont, and the dough probably is worse for it.I realized I had forgotten the biscuit cutter and hunted for it anxiously, a curse ready on my tongue. It would not do to fail now. I found it somewhat predictable in the jar, which isnt a jar. I stare at the biscuit cutter for a second and I wonder if it was always this rusty.As the biscuits bake, I sit and think in the oven glow. He was my friend, he was a good one, good to others, but especially me. Ive heard that some siblings arent friends, which always strikes me with its extreme oddity. But he was my best friend in a way.The kitchen door slides open, carelessly spilling the light into the night darkened living room, interrupting my solitary vigil.Hi mom, I say.Youre up.I shrug my shoulders.She looks around the kitchen. I noticed we were out of biscuits, I say.Her eyes tremble. I havent felt like making them.I glance at the timer. Theyll be ready in a few minutes.We break bread together. I'm no English major, but the irony of it simmers on my nerves just west of pleasantly. They are hot, and good. The pockets of butter I have failed to mix properly taste wonderful and fill them with a delicious taste. They taste almost like coming back from a long journey late at night and finding a cup of hot chocolate waiting on the table and an old friend ready for a chat. Almost.We eat in silence, the bitterness hovering lightly in our mouths.Before the last crumbs are gone, I speak.Tell me why you didnt try to help him.She avoids my eyes. I did.I raise my head. You should have told me.It was easier to let you believe it was my fault, she breathes. I didnt want you to have to believe She took a shaky breath. It really  his life to live.And his to end, I mutter.I split the last biscuit with her. The butter is deliciously sweet. But the baking soda still sinks into my senses. I taste them both, the bitter and the sweet. The good and the bad. I think in silence as the sunrise breaks through the sky, grabbing for new life with a reaching, golden glow."
weird.. the title went away.. the coming of the clones,"My parents were getting a divorce. I got to be with two great old third cousins in Billings. They ran a Pawn store. It was more of an antique store. They were refined and their place was wonderful. Their dog's name was Thor a huge old German Shepherd.Anyway they went up taking me with them to a old cafe next to the drive in theatre next to the Rim and close to the airport.There they left me with the cafe waitress as the two old ladies purchased some antiques from the owner in the back.Me? I got a hamburger and fries and coke. Thinking and watching and reading.When in walked in a journalist for the Billings paper. He had just flown in from Hawaii by the looks of his shirt. He was tired and ordered a rum and coke. IE the cafe was a bar if memory serves me. And looking around he wandered over to where I was reading. I think I was reading Archie comic book.Anyway, he was lonely or something and started to talk to me. This was the 70s and I listened.He was working with some guy that owned one of the major delivery services. Who? I think it was Fed Ex. Anyway the guy had stumbled upon the idea to save on the death tax. Meaning? He was wealthy and at the time the wealth tax was like 63.4 percent or something like that. So?The guy had decided to clone himself. Meaning? He was dying and wanted to see what he would have become if he had all the life great advantages. Best schools, hospitals, etc.Meaning? He had grown up the hard way and made is business work because of persistence and hard work. He wondered if what would happen if he had gotten everything would he have succeed or not.Anyway he hired several doctors to clone himself. The cloning process he started in the states. Then moved to the Philippines because of finding women there cheaper to have embryos implanted and hush money for other weird things to happen to them.Anyway the guy kept talking and I listened. The whole concept of cloning people was something I knew a little on having read a book on it.I asked what cells were to be used? The guy looked at me like I was a monster. Who are you? Meaning I was a little kid and I think he was expecting me to listen and not know anything.I am me. And with that he went on to tell me what cell was being used.Evidently the guy who was funding this thing went nuts or something. Meaning? He removed all his signatures from paperwork, and fingerprints ect. Drew up contracts and made sure that when they succeed he could retire and that the clone or what not would take over for him.Evidently this data research had been on going for a while for the Billings reporter was the Ethical person. What a laugh. The rich guy threw him out at the end and got his clone.And?From my understanding the reporter said the guys fingerprints were an 89 percent match. The eye color. hair color, and some birth mark resembling something were remarkably the same.The kid? Evidently had been born a while ago because he was attending some prep school and intelligence wise seemed to be doing quite well.To all this I had listened to while eating and wondering if I could go back to my comic book. Reason? He did not tell me the source of the DNA. So I asked again. And instead of looking like I was a monster he told me.Sadness that disease is how cloning will begin and end.Now? I see his articles from time to time. I wonder if he remembers telling me that story. As for him? He wrote a book and published it in 1985 talking about the Philippine cloning program. Not using names of course. It was a good read. And the clone? Seems the wealthy people do quite well changing laws and now death taxation is almost all but forgotten.And cloning? Ask Brittany Speares she knows what Mandela effect is and what she is experiencing right now. Meaning?We all be dead here. The sun has not been real for a long time and God? He won the war between world government versus heaven. And humanity? Well humanity loses first to the giants, then to the zombies created by world governments to fight the giants, and finally to heaven or UFOs which everyone seems to want to fight. And?Well, the vaccine forces compliance to the patent 2000060606 crypto currency which Microsoft patented on March 20, 2020. And that compliance leads to corporate fascism which in turns leads to your very life, sex life, work life and everything in life to be taken over and controlled. Meaning? Soon everyone will be clones because sex will be outlawed. And? An end of time happens. Why? cloning of cancer cells only works for so long and the cells break down.Don't take my word for this. Read. Think. That is the sad part of this being the past. You can no longer think clearly. For if I am telling you that you are living in the time of tribulation and you do not fall on your knees and repent. It is already to late for you. And if you are vaccinated? Put a magnet up to your skin and watch and realize you are now part of the borg collective of the battery microsoft created. And? Well, for those of us not part of your group. You will kill us for a time.Well, time travel exists and they fail to find a solution and man kind die out. How long/ A long time ago if my journal of a Wondering mind through the multiverse is true. A very long time ago. You see I am a time traveler these days. Going back in time. A closed time curved loop traveler. And well if I am telling you the truth? You have been dead a very long time and this story? This is my ghost story. Welcome to my ghost story."
Will This Day Ever End?,"Will This Day Ever End? By Heather Ann Martinez Supermarket Apology If you were at the supermarket on Lake and Fourth at two oclock, I really want to apologize to any of you who were injured or had fruit thrown in your face. I know some of you can relate to having a day that never seems to end. This one is definitely that for me. Some Back Story My name is Abby Trait. Im married to Syler and we have five daughters and two sons. Syler and I are selling our house, moving in with my parents until our new house is built. Did I mention my parents were only able to give up two bedrooms and one bathroom in their seven bedroom house?The other bedrooms look like museums dedicated to the 70s and 80s. Syler works in the city. He has to wear a clean, pressed suit every day to go to his job. My job is a little more casual in dress code, but I still like to dress professionally. My parents are retired and spend a lot of time at the golf club with their friends. If we are in a pinch, they will babysit our kids. Unfortunately, we are in a pinch today. More unfortunately, my parents arent available. So, I brought all seven children with me. I couldnt cancel all of my appointments. Moving Confessions I am fortunate that most of my co-workers work remotely. I settled my kids into an empty conference room, and I worked at my desk periodically checking on them. Normally, they are well behaved. The summer, however, has had them cooped up in the house with grandparents telling them not to touch anything in several rooms of the house. As if this werent enough, we are also moving to a new home with most of our favorite toys and clothes in storage tubs and boxes. It is not just the kids that feel displaced though, Syler and I do too. Syler said the new house would be ready by the end of June. Now, the contractors have said maybe August or October being the latest. We still havent sold our old house. Our potential buyers keep finding things wrong with the house. This morning, the husband said that our kitchen floor is too uneven. He rolled a marble down one end to the other. I told him I never noticed that. Of course, I never rolled marbles on th floor from one end to the other. I didnt let the kids play with their marbles or blocks in the kitchen. They had a drawer full of plastic pots and pans and fake eggs and bacon. I couldnt understand how or why this man felt the kitchen floor was too uneven. Was he planning on sleeping on the floor? I asked him if he had any other concerns and he emailed me his list. I read through them and frowned. It was only nine in the morning. I was so ready to put this day behind me.Marathon Run and Work Fridge Confessions No sooner did I hang up with the potential buyer did Syler text me. He left his tie on the train and forgot to pick up the dry cleaning. The owner of the dry cleaners was angry we had not paid our bill. He wanted cash on the spot or he was going to toss our clothes! I ushered the kids out of the conference room. I drove to the bank to get cash, stopped at my parents home to grab another tie, and I drove to the dry cleaners. I paid the owner, and I took our dry cleaning. My sons kept kicking Sylers pants as they were sword fighting behind my seat. I met Syler at the train depot to give him his tie so he could attend the luncheon with his client. I went back to my office and settled the kids back into the conference room. I bribed them. I begged them to be quiet and I tip toed back to my desk. I was already exhausted and it was eleven oclock. I packed lunches for the kids before we left the house, but I forgot to pack something for myself. I rummaged through the fridge and found a jelly doughnut and two cream cupcakes from the birthday party two days ago. Was I supposed to be dieting? Of course, there were also the low cal no taste diet drinks at the bottom of the fridge. I decided to grab one of those too. I went back to my desk. I responded to my emails, made phone calls, and left messages. I looked up and the clock on the wall seemed to move ever so slowly. My stomach started gurgling. I was still hungry. I went back to the fridge and guzzled a second diet drink not realizing the first one stained my blouse. The second drink stained my skirt and some of the jelly doughnut remained in my hair until I showered the next morning. Seven kids There are days when bribing your kids just doesnt work. My oldest boy decided to pick a fight with his younger sisters and they went running through the supermarket. They stepped on toes, pushed people with the shopping cart, tossed apples and grapes at one another and the mortgage lender called. We failed to make a payment in the process of moving to my parents house. I cried in the middle of the cereal aisle. I couldnt see where the kids were, and I had to negotiate paying this bill. I knew we didnt have enough money to pay two mortgage payments. Syler was counting on this luncheon with this client to tide us over until we sell the house. The mortgage company agreed to wait another day before adding fees and potentially ruining our credit. Syler called a bit later. The client signed the contract for a September start. He suggested we ask my parents for a loan to get us through the summer. He told me I was going to have to swallow my pride. He reminded me we have seven kids. When this day ends When this day ends, you will find seven kids in five beds and two sleeping bags fast asleep. You will find Syler asking my parents for a loan in the kitchen over tea and crumb cake. You will find me in the bathtub sipping a glass of white wine and eating slices of a store bought frozen pizza.Of course, as I was about to take that wonderful greasy last bite, my cell phone rang. It was our potential buyer again. He said the hallway closet was too close to the master bedroom and wanted to know if we could have it moved five inches in the opposite direction before we closed. I told him I would talk it over with Syler and get back to him next week. Will this day ever end?"
We Are The Legacy,"Pumpkin spice soup, fresh baked bread- crunchy and flakey on the outside, warm and soft in the middle, butter melting, pooling into the crevices of the family insignia stamped on to every loaf. They sat around the waxed wood table as a tuxedoed waiter served them on cold, silver platters, light dancing across domed covers. The candles were dimmed in an attempt to gather minds to their one tethered commonality, to shadow watery eyes, pulsing jaws, and a fiercely competitive spirit. The eldest placed himself at the head off the table, where the king had once smiled gently, peacefully, at his five, strong willed children. Except Artie- Artie was the soft son, the easy going mediator. His heart sank into the pit of his stomach, clenching his appetite as the intruders hard eyes, same grey as their fathers, dove deep into him, searching for a break, a leak. Though the nation held grievings today, the five knew this assembly was not about who had left them, but what hed left behind. Cutlery clattered against bowls of rich, lamb stew, echoing through the grand hall, maroon carpeting covering dusty floorboards. The reverberating filled the fear of voicing anything, of deciding a future, uncertain no matter the conclusion. One faulty step and what, when they were children could have ended in a bickering, a blamed tear, could now conclude as war. With a sudden sharp cackle, the third brother, Vixon, snorted, choking on his mouthful, eyes wet with salt and laughter, attracting glares, stifling his laughter with a hand over his mouth, struggling to gather it back. But as had often been the case, staying serious was not his strong suit, especially under pressure and giggles pushed themself to the surface, rolling back and forth in his elegant armchair, until the first brother slapped a meaty hand against the table, deep frown leaking into his temples, tightening his clenched teeth. Silence! He bellowed, annoyance settling like dust into the crevices of his eyes as he looked over the people he once knew better than himself, could always trust to be predictable, true to their strong characters. His voice dropped, gentler. You all know we have matters to discuss, and we might as well begin. He waved near the radio crew, who rolled a creaky old broadcasting panel and rusty mic into the room, pulling out a thick manila folder. In their cottage homes, hideouts, and grand foyers, families gathered to listen to their previous leaders wishes and will to be proclaimed, secret to all before then, even his airs. Radios sputtered to life as a distant voice introduced the siblings, and passed the microphone to Ferdinand- who presumed, as eldest, to be righteously crowned the next king. Though the rest feared it, they dreaded knowing that he was most likely right. Miro, the second oldest, believed that as the most handsome, daring, striking of the family, outranking every other in popularity, and in knightly skills, he should be crowned King. Vixon, bubbly, speaking in senseless gibberish, fun and goofy, with a mysteriously dark side, should be crowned, because he would not take the job as seriously and focus on the happiness of others, spreading joy and laughter. Artie did not hold such a strong opinion, knowing that whatever his father wrote down must have had a lot of thought put into it, and be the right choice in the long term. He did not want to rule, he was content to curl up and read in a comfortable nook, watch as others were ridiculed and fanned over, stay out of the drama. Talia, as the only daughter and youngest, had always been loved and fawned over by the mothers of the extended family, after her own had passed away in childbirth. Though only nineteen, she believed that her bravery, loyalty and fearlessness, believed to be their fathers favourite, after Artie of course, could win her the crown as first queen not through marriage. As Ferdinand drew the paper from the folder, all watched, ears strained to hear his reaction, his words, his face paled, devouring the beginning lines before reading them out loud. He considered making it up, telling a different story, but the line between the truth and his fiction was too thin for comfort. Through trembling, thin lips, he read.  And he proceeded to explain the details of his solution, which ruler shall live where, and thats how we ended up here, 100 years later. Xavier closed the book, Quill crawling up onto his lap, green blue brown eyes looking up in wonder, full of bursting questions. But whos land was this? Which sibling? He asked, front teeth missing so that the ss sounding like ths, small socked feet curled onto the red and grey thick comforter where his twin brother, Clove, had fallen asleep during the traditional telling every June the 26th, day of the Seperation. For the most part, the family didnt really celebrate any of the holidays, join in on the patriotic celebrations, but today, when Xavier had come across the old storybook his mother used to read to him, he had felt the urge to pull it out from the musty cardboard box in their forest cottage. The air smelt like cedar and pine. Fairy lights twinkled, roping through the ceiling boards as he answered. Arties. Xavier smiled. The other lands have grown into bustling cities- we are the only ones who live so simply. With forests, among creatures. He looked over at Finn, Quills hedgehog who sniffed around a vase of purple, bubbly water. Thats odd. Quill bit his top row of teeth over his bottom, frowning, dark freckles creasing into dimples as he thought. You know, my great great aunts cousin was married to Artie. I never met him though. Xavier smiled fondly down at the six year old curled up in his lap. Whoa! Quill smiled wide. Thats so cool! Its like were all related! He exclaimed as Xavier put a gentle finger to his lips, trying to quiet him down so he wouldnt wake his brother, nodding. The way Quill said related really sounded more like arrated, Xavier smiled, picking him up, over his head, soft pjs against his hands, pretending to let Quill fly, up and around, before placing him onto the top bunk, tucking the blankets up to his chin. Night. He whispered over the ledge, flicking off the lights. Night. Quill replied, snuggling into sleep, moon bathing the room, shading his brown mop of wavy hair. Xavier sat back down on the couch, layden with pillows and hand knitted quilts and tosses. He stared down at the book he held, let his hand glide over the smooth cover. One day, maybe, Quill would know the whole story, their whole link to it. That separating was really not as easy as all that, that families had been torn apart, forced away from each other. That their own had staged an uprising, that they werent really supposed to live here at all, that their hideout, their small community was the only safe place left. Outside the forest, wars raged over jealousy and hate, skyscrapers licking steamy skies. Still though, the forest was safe, and for Quill, for Clove, for all the others, for Finn, for Artie, it was a haven. As Quill hikes mountains, swims in crystal lakes among green, ripe trees, as Clove reads stories, fresh air streaming from the water, bites into a sugary, sour fruit. 12 years old already, in shorts and tank tops, willowy and tall. 17 years old, murmurs rising in the night, as the saints come marching in. They know now. They know they are the descendants of fire breathing, rapid talking sorcerers, of truth bearing archers and brave uprisers. Pumpkin spice soup, fresh baked bread- crunchy and flakey on the outside, warm and soft in the middle, butter melting, pooling into the crevices of the family insignia stamped on to every loaf- Quill reads as Xavier lies down, head in his lap, breath shaky, legacy draining into his ears, cold rushing through his chest. His bony hand takes that of each of his sons. In that cottage among a patch of forest, a few remaining, lingering trees, as twinkling fairy lights bathe the moon lit room, they are safe."
Untitled Document,"A blank piece of paper sat in front of her, lying on the desk. She didnt usually write on paper, but this was an emergency. Her thoughts were racing, and she was desperately trying to find an idea somewhere, anything would work at this point. She began to hyperventilate, taking deep breaths to try and calm herself down. A manuscript due in four days and all I have in front of me in an untitled document! Blank! She was breathing hard now, desperately trying to calm herself down. Im screwed she whispered to herself.Sure looks like itAlex? Priya was beginning to feel her heartbeat rising again, her breathing increasing.Whats up Priya, long time no see, I know.Long time? LONG TIME? Its been 7 years, Alex! 7 Years after you left me and never bothered to contact me again! Priya was fuming, and the anger inside her body was bubbling up, rising higher and higher.I know, its been a while, and yes, I know I left you, and Im a jerk,yeah, but you need to calm down. Im just here to talk. Actually to ask you something, but I guess thats technically talking. He was teetering back and forth on his feet, and he was clearly nervous. Priya knew that something was definitely up, and she was running through the options in her head.Ok, Ill hear you out, but this better be good or else Im calling the police and telling them you broke in. Priya had this weird feeling of uncertainty in her stomach, a weird feeling of fear almost.I left after 7 years because I had to. You saw how bad I was getting. You saw the drugs, I know you did, so I left. It was better for you. I never dated anyone else in the past 7 years, just thought Id let you know that. I also read your book. About us. I know how you feel towards me Priya, the book says it all.Priya knew that what he was saying had some truth to it, but she didnt want to accept it. No matter the reason, he still left her, that too right before he was going to meet her parents. She was going to marry him. Ok fine whatever, your right, but you never answered my question. What are you doing here?Im here for you. Lets go away together. A road trip, just like the old times.A road trip? For two days? Priya could go and still come back and finish her manuscript in time, no doubt she was a fast writer, but she didnt know if she wanted to go. She looked at the blank white piece of paper lying on her desk, the untitled document. Maybe she could make a story out of the road trip, but Priya wasnt going to accept so easily .Love or not, she still didnt trust Alex. Why should I go with you? I dont have to trust no, nor do I have reason to. What if your just taking me on a road trip to kidnap me or to take me to be  human trafficked  so you can get money for your Cocaine or whatever drug it was you took?I know it seems hard to trust me right now Priya, but you have to. I love you Priya, I have for the last 13 years. Let me prove that I love you by taking you on this trip.Priya could sense there was more to the story, a reason behind why he turned up at her house out of the blue, but she didnt push it. He would tell her eventually, she had a way of getting things out of him. Fine, but if I dont want to at any time you have to take me home right then, no questions asked.He put his hands up in surrender and teetered back and forth on his feet. So, nice apartment you have here, huh?Get out, Ill pack some clothes and meet you outside.Sheesh fine, but hurry up. Oh, and pack a nice dress.Alex walked out the door, running down the stairs to the lobby. He didnt think he would have the guts to come back, to face Priya again after all the pain he knew he had caused her, but he had to. It was the right thing to do. Suddenly, his phone lit up with a text message, and his eyes widened. They had to move fast.Whyd you ask me to pack a nice dress? Priya came downstairs in the same black sweatpants and turquoise shirt that she was wearing before, but she had put her hair down and taken off her glasses.She didnt really care how she looked around Alex, she never had, but the way he was staring at her now she wondered if she should have changed, or put her hair back up. Did she really look that gross to him?She was beautiful. He had seriously underestimated how much a persons looks could change in 7 years. Her black hair was now cut in layers and was wavy and curly, and it looked shiny and soft. Her eyes were a beautiful dark brown, mirroring the Night and the fall leavesin one. She was stunning before, but it was nothing compared to how she looked now. His jaw nearly dropped, but he knew how Priya hated cheesy stuff like that, and so he straightened up and cleared his throat. You look beautiful he said to her as she approached him. She showed no sign of caring, and just handed him her bag.So, wheres your car? she asked.You look beautiful he said again. Alex didnt think she heard him the first time, and if he was being honest it bothered him that she didnt even smile after he said that.I heard you the first time. she said, and walked out of the lobby. Alex couldnt tell if he was pissed or just dissapointed, but that didnt matter, not now.Priya was happy and concerned at the same time. She was happy that he'd called her pretty, but concerned about him. Was he on drugs again? He couldn't be, she knew how he was when he was high, but he was constantly teetering on his feet and checking his phone, and Priya knew that something was going on. She hoped that it was a home thing , probably with his family. She didnt want to push it, because she knew that Alex had a complicated family, but she also wanted to know why he turned up randomly, and why he was acting so strange around her.Alright, you ready to get started? Alex tried to muster as much happiness as he could into his voice.Uh, yeah I guess. So, where are we going?Umm, not far, you know just a couple hour or so from here in New Jersey. He knew right after he said New Jersey that Priya knew what he was talking about.Were going to your home? But, why?Please, Priya just trust me, Ill tell you I promise.Ok, fine.They began to drive, and it was silent for at least 15 minutes.Gosh, theres a lot of traffic in New York. Its 2 in the morning, do people not sleep here or what? Alex was desperately trying to make small talk, even though he knew that there were bigger things that he should be telling Priya, and his breath became faster at the thought of telling Priya the truth.Its New York City, Alex, of course people dont sleep. Priya kept looking over at Alex, whos face was filled with tension. Her curiosity only grew by the minute, but if it was about his family she wouldnt pry. He would tell her himself.Is it always like this, I mean -Priya interrupted him mid-sentence as he was hyperventilating.Alex take some deep breaths, its going to be okay. Whats happening? Youve been acting strange since you turned up. Priya put her hand on Alexs and he began to calm down, and Priya gripped it hard.Its nothing, Priya, I promise you. Alex knew he was lying and he felt bad, but he had to. For Priya's sake. If she knew how messed up his life had gotten, then she would end up jumping out of the car, end up marrying someone else, end up having someone elses kids. She was 28 after all, maybe she had moved on.Alex, your doing it again. Whats wrong? Talk to me. Priya was gripping his hand again, and Alex knew this had to stop.Priya, stop! Ill tell you once were out of New York, I swear! Priya withdrew her hand quickly and she straightened up, all forms of concern for him being wiped off her face. Alex felt a pang in his stomach, and he wanted to apologize but he knew that he couldnt, not now.An hour later, they were out of New York and entering New Jersey. Priya could see Alexs palms sweating, and he was tapping his fingers hard against the steering wheel.Look Priya, Im really sorr-Alexs phone started ringing, and he immediately pulled over into a nearby gas station. The only words Priya heard were, before he slammed the car door. Ten minutes later, he still hadnt come back, and so Priya got out of the car and went to the trees nearby where Alex had went. When she entered the forest, Priya swore she heard weeping, and she ran to the trees, where Alex was. The closer she got, the louder the weeping did too. She saw Alex sitting on the ground with his head in his hand sobbing, and she ran to hug him.Are you okay? Alex, talk to me. Are you okay? Whats wrong? He said nothing in response but he wrapped his hands around her and held her tightly to him.Once he finished crying, he let go of Priya, and she felt cold. Alex?My mom. Shes really sick. Priya, shes dying. Priya gasped, and she could feel tears coming to her eyes too.Oh, Alex, Im so sorry. Priya rushed to hug him, but Alex tilted her head upwards, pulling her hands to his sides . His hands were on both sides of her face, and their lips were close together.Can I kiss you? Alex asked Priya. He was fully expecting a no, but when she nodded it felt like a million fireworks were going off inside him. One of his hands snaked down to her wrist, pulling her closer to him, and he put his lips on hers, firmly pressing them together, entwining her heart with his. If he thought he felt a million fireworks when she said she could kiss him, then this was the end of the universe. It felt like stars were exploding inside of him, shooting every which way, and with every kiss he could feel their hearts become one.That was the best kiss that shed ever had. It felt like shed swallowed a million stars which were exploding and shooting everywhere. She could feel his heart, but it wasnt his heart anymore. It was their heart. Priya fully expected to not like the kiss, but the taste of cotton candy and mint on his lips, mixed with the scent of fall perfume was heaven to her, and she felt herself craving more, even after the kiss had been broken. But she knew that right now, Alex needed her, and she leaned into his chest, feeling his arms wrapping around her tightly.My mom said that she wanted to meet you before she died, she wanted to see us get married. I told her you were the girl Id been in love with since I was 15, and she said that she wouldnt die without meeting you. The Universe commanded it, she said. I was going to bring you there, introduce you to my mom. I was going to propose to you.Who said you cant? Ill marry you Alex, and not just because your mom is dying, but because I love you. Weve been in love for 13 years, I think we can get married.Alex felt so happy, the stars seemed to come back and shoot everywhere, but this time it wasnt just the stars it felt like he swallowed the universe, the Moon, the Sun, the Earth, everything.Priya, at least let me propose to you properly. Priya laughed and it felt like tinkles of happiness entered his ears. It was good to know that after 7 years, Priya still had the same laughter as always.Fine, Im sorry for being so impatient, but I do have to tell my parents. Their going to be so mad Alex, but its okay. Ill tell my mom to bring the wedding dress she bought for me this year, and we can have an Indian wedding and a normal wedding. Wait, wait , hold up, whyd your mom buy you a wedding dress?Oh, she said that I was 28 and I was getting really old, and I was going to be too old to marry soon. So she bought me the dress and she told me to find someone to marry in the next two months or Id end up getting too fat for the dress. She basically tried to guilt-trip me into marriage, but its okay, because it all worked out in the end. Alex laughed, and he knew that this was the Universe at work. Maybe fate was real after all.An hour and a half later, they were at Alexs house, and Priya was starting to get nervous. What if his mom ended up not liking her? She didnt exactly have the best personality, but Priya would have to try.Hey, shes going to love you, dont worry about it.They walked inside the house, and Alex walked inside his moms room, gesturing for Priya to follow.Mom? Priyas here.Priya? You mean THE Priya? Wow, shes so pretty, prettier than you described her. Alexs mom had piercing blue eyes, just like Alex, and they both had the same dirty blonde hair, the same pale/tan skin tone.Priya blushed and smiled at Alexs mom. Hi Mrs. Lewis, its so nice to finally meet you! Im Priya Akkiraja, and Im your sons girlfriend.For starters, call me May, and secondly come here. Priya walked over to his mom, and sat down next to her.Your so stunning Priya, you and my son will look beautiful together, and as far as Im concerned he loves and you love him, right?Yes Mrs.- I mean May.Do me a favor and dont break his heart, hes been through a lot.I swear on my mothers life that I will never break his heart, and I will take care of him for the rest of his life.Alex stood up, smiling widely, Well, speaking of spending the rest of our lives together, and he got down on one knee, and pulled out a ring, I've been meaning to ask if youll marry me, Priya. Will you marry me?Yes! Yes! Priya jumped up and down, excited. Wait. Is that my grandmas old wedding ring?Yeah, I may or may not have convinced your parents to let me marry you, and they may or may not be here.I love you so much right now you have no idea.I think I might have a faint idea of how much you love me , just a little bit.Priya laughed, her dimple on the left side of her cheek showing, and Alex laughed with her, picking her up and spinning her around.Two weeks laterPriya was dressed in a and she was wearing a  over her head, jasmine flowers interwoven into her hair, a wrapped around her head, a  stuck in her Alex was weaning a and a Silk cotton shirt over it. They were both sitting across from each other, smiling, while the priest said the rites, in a boring monotone voice, but it didn't matter how small or how boring their wedding was. It didn't matter that Priya never got her manuscript done. None of it mattered, because the Universe willed it so. Their hearts beat as one, all because of one blank piece of paper.

Mulberry pies and Lemonade,"Tuesday used to be Bunnys favourite day of the week. His teachers had gotten used to him quietly inching the zipper of his bag closed ten minutes before the end of the day, and running out the second the bell rang. A usually well-behaved little boy, it was hard not to smile when they looked out the window a minute later. He could spot Gams head anywhere. She would always be in same spot under the giant oak tree at the entrance of the school. She welcomed him with her arms outstretched and a smile brighter than the sun. Her unruly grey curls would tickle his nose as he leapt onto her, both giggling wildly.The street was lined with fig trees and there were countless stray cats that would watch inquisitively as the car pulled up to the driveway. It was a bit of a crooked house, where broken window panes were repaired with whatever spare wood Gramps found. But Bunny loved it. There was an overgrown garden out the front and a tiled footpath which weaved through the plants and lead to the front door. There was a bird bath hidden behind some bushes where bell miners and magpies would splash in the water. They would sometimes let him feed them the sliced up fruit Gams gave him. It was the kind of garden you could get lost in, and find things youd forgotten youd lost. The inside was even better. It had sturdy wooden furniture he could climb on and a big green sofa he could sink in. The fireplace crackled and hissed in the winter and he would sit on Gams lap as she knitted and read to him.He especially loved going over on special occasions, because they would make the most yummiest thing in the world, Gams famous mulberry pie. It had won two contests and people would sometimes even order them in advance for Christmas or special family dinners. A few years ago, he went over for his birthday, and his mouth salivated the whole drive home thinking about biting into the warm, delicious flaky crust and tangy filling. He was buzzing when they pulled on their gumboots to go mulberry picking. His boots were navy blue with yellow hedgehogs on them and Gams were dark green. They grabbed the woven baskets and plodded to the fence where they grew aplenty.Do you want to know the easiest and most fastest way to pick mulberries, Bunny?She spread two large tea towels on the ground. She firmly gripped the coiling branches and shook them. A million mulberries rattled and rolled out, staining the tea towels ruby. He got to work eagerly, and it wasnt long before the baskets were filled to the brim and a bit more.The pie had to be eaten fresh out of the oven and served with a swirl of whipped cream. It was never grainy or too sour. As soon as the pie was cooked, Gams took out a sieve and a little sachet of white powder. He stood on his tippy toes trying to get a better look. She winked at him.Its a magic ingredient. On the first day of summer, the moon man visits and brings me this little bag of moon powder, she whispered.She sprinkled the white powder on top of the pie. He looked on, mesmerised, it was like snow.It really makes all the difference.She served the pie alongside a jar of homemade lemonade. They sat on the porch and watched the cats play till the sun went down.Nobody could make mulberry pie like Gams. It was only last year, his mum was pulling the third pie out of the oven the night before a school bake sale. She spooned out the side and rolled it around her mouth. She closed her eyes in frustration and clattered the dirty spatulas into the sink. Grab my phone will you sweetheart, we need to consult an expert. His grandmother had answered the phone, already laughing. I already gave you a written recipe!.Then what am I doing wrong?, his mum wailed dramatically.Well, I suspect youre missing the magic ingredient.She looked at the recipe card. It was in Gams swirly handwriting and she had even drew little pictures on the side.I followed the exact directions it said word for word!I think Bunny should be able to help. His mum hung up the phone and looked at him quizzically.Sorry Mum, I dont think the moon man visited us.She rolled her eyes and glared at the pies in front of her.Well if he does, tell him its his fault my pies are ruined.He couldnt imagine she was the same lady lying in front of him today. His mum had gotten angry at him at the hospital last time because he had refused to go in. He didnt want to today either but his mums eyes were still red from crying and he didnt want to upset her more. Gams head was wrapped in a shawl. Tubes ran up her arm and through her nose. She had dark circles under her eyes like she hadnt slept in years and she was thin, so thin.He ran out of the hospital room. He could hear his mother calling him back but he didnt care. He ran through countless halls and stairs until he finally saw the giant glass doors leading outside. He sat on a bench at the bus stop outside. He looked at the cars driving by and all the busy mothers and their babies and businessmen striding past him. He felt incredibly small and his eyes welled up with tears.His mum frantically ran out a few moments later. Her expression softened when she saw him.You dont have to see her if you dont want to. I just thought it might be a good idea bef-listen, its okay. Lets go home.She pulled him into her chest. He held on tightly, quiet sobs ballooning out of him.The floorboards creaked. He had never noticed that before. And its cold. The house smelled like Gams but it felt hollow. He crept around the furniture gingerly. He felt sick. He shut the front door quietly behind him. He walked through the garden, which was mostly as he remembered it, although the grass was up to his knees now. He spotted lorikeets by the mulberry plants, picking at the glossy fruits and chattering away happily. The woven basket was hanging off a fence post. There was a purple ribbon attached to it. His heart started pounding as he walked over to it. It was too high for him to reach, even on his tiptoes. He noticed some rocks nearby and dragged them to the fence where he carefully stacked them. His feet wobbled and he almost fell, but he caught himself against the post. He stretched his arms towards the basket and carefully picked it up. Inside was a little brown sachet with a note attached to it, written in swirly handwriting."
a bento love,"It was a typical Monday evening. The dark colour of the night outside contrasted the bright colours of the lights in a bustling restaurant.  A pair of small dark brown eyes eyed the door of the restaurant. It was packed with families and couples who came to have a good, hearty meal. The little girl shifted uncomfortably on her small brown stool beside the counter as she scanned the faces of every customer with worry. ""Father?"" She asked, shifting her eyes to the black haired man in the kitchen behind her. The man in the kitchen wiped the sweat off his head with a hand at her call, and smiled at his 9 year old daughter. ""Yes, Martha?"" He asked before getting back to cooking. The nametag stating ""Head Chef"" neatly placed above his heart glistened slightly with the light in the restaurant. Martha's father was the head chef of the restaurant. Martha's mother was often busy with her job overseas, so her father liked to bring Martha along with him to the restaurant to that she could be taken care of much easily. ""Is Aunt Julie okay? She hasn't eaten here in a long time."" Martha replied, frowning. ""That's right, I haven't seen her in a while. She used to come here to have her dinner everyday, I do wonder if she's doing fine lately."" Martha's father replied, a hint of concern in his words. Martha bit her bottom lip and scrunched her eyes in concentration, trying to think of ways she could help Aunt Julie. Aunt Julie was Martha's favourite regular in her father's restaurant. She lived in the apartment block right beside the restaurant and could come in quite often. At times, when there were little people in the restaurant, she would go up to Aunt Julie's table and have a short conversation with her. Martha still remembered the time she was invited inside her apartment for a short tea session. She was an amazing aunt to be around as she had many interesting stories to tell about her past, and had an amazing personality. However, the restaurant got more popular these few weeks, and more people came pouring in to eat the food at the restaurant. Martha hardly saw the face of her favourite aunt, and had to opt to sitting around the counter to help if needed. She was determined to visit Aunt Julie again. Suddenly, Martha had an idea. She got down her stool and made her way into the kitchen through the back door, grabbing a small container from a cabinet. She then returned to the counter with a slight skip in her steps. Her father, who just finished his shift in the kitchen, just so happened to walk towards the counter. He looked at the container in surprise. After a few seconds, he seemed to understand what his daughter was doing and shot her a knowing grin. He rushed back into the kitchen. Not long after, he exited the kitchen again. His hand held small containers of rice, salmon, and vegetables. Martha raised an eyebrow. ""Father, are you sure we can use the ingredients from the restaurant's kitchen?"" She asked, feeling a bit unsure. ""Not if it's for a customer."" He replied, giving her a cheeky wink. Martha chuckled at her dad as she opened the containers with rice. With her spoon, she managed to gather a good amount of rice in one half of the small container. She then placed the cooked salmon on the other half of the compartment, together with a bunch of broccoli for a healthy touch. Martha closed the small container with a smile before placing the container in a carrier. She then rushed to get a note and a pen from the counter. Her father chuckled at her kindness, and managed to slip a small container of miso soup into the carrier without her noticing. He knew that Aunt Julie would definitely miss the restaurant's miso soup, as it was a great finish to a meal. Martha quickly rushed back with a post-it note and sticked it to the front of the carrier. She turned to her father, mouth open to ask a question when he interrupted her. ""Don't be back too late."" He said, patting his daughter's head fondly. Martha closed her mouth and gave her father a grin before going out of the restaurant. She followed the familiar path towards Aunt Julie's apartment and knocked on her door excitedly. There was some muffled shuffling behind the door before it opened. The door revealed Aunt Julie, who looked shocked as she noticed Martha. ""Martha!"" She exclaimed in surprise, bringing the younger into a big hug. ""How have you been? I'm sorry for not coming to your restaurant lately, my back was strained not too long ago and i was advised to rest at home."" Aunt Julie explained to Martha, a sad smile on her face. ""The restaurant's been really popular lately! But I missed talking with you in the restaurant, so I decided to visit with a bento that I made with the help of my father."" Martha said, raising the carrier with the containers towards her proudly. Aunt Julie received the carrier, the corners of her eyes burning with tears at the little girl's actions. She couldn't believe how much kindness the little girl held within her heart. ""Thank you so much, Martha. But you should head back to the restaurant, it's getting late. I wouldn't want your father to worry."" She spoke, as she gestured towards the door with a warm smile. Martha hesitated for a bit, before nodding her head. ""Alright, I'll head back. Eat the food while it's still warm. I hope that your back heals up soon!"" Martha said, before she closed the door softly. Aunt Julie patted the carrier in her arms as the faint footsteps outside slowly faded into the distance. She noticed a post-it note on the carrier and picked it up curiously. On the paper, there was a neatly written note. """""
Intangible,"Perhaps the word ""Intangible"" is the commonest word used in my family. Weird, right? You just follow me, I'll tell you the story.""Strange"" is also a highly familiar word but I think ""Intangible"" is more common. You see, in my family, a lot of weird things happen. In fact we're a whole bunch of weirdos(except me)-my father has a personal alarm clock that rings at 2am every Saturday just so he could wake up and dance. He never missed the time; he would wake up and dance with high music blasting from his system. And what's even weirder is, it doesn't wake mom up from her sleep, even though she sleeps next to him. At least I never hear her complain in the mornings, she has in fact on one or two occasions claimed that he was fun to watch. Fun to watch?? How can anyone dancing at 2am in front of you with loud music when you're sleeping be fun to watch? Well, it's not my problem. If Dad ever comes to my room to try that, imma leave his house the next day because I can't cope with that weirdness. One day I asked him why he does that. I used to think it was a family ritual that if regularly done will keep us alive or whatnot. His reply was, ""Dancing keeps my bones alive and keeps me in shape"" and at that moment, I wanted to shove his ass off my face coz to me, he was spitting nonsense. My mom has her own quirks too. And I don't even know whose is worse. When mom eats, you don't hear any sound from her mouth. Now that would have been a good table manner, only that she tries hard and forces her mouth to stay silent. She says, ""You miss a star when your mouth makes noise while eating"". You wonder what that means? I wonder too. It would have been something easy to cope with if she did it alone. No she doesn't! And that sucks. SHE WANTS TO CARRY US CHILDREN ALONG IN HER NO-SOUND EATING HABIT THINGY! My sister obeys her and eats her food silently, without whining or chewing loudly,but I do not have the patience. Even dad doesn't, but he still obeys her and chew silently. When the arguments get heated up between mom and I, I always carry my tray into my from, lock the door behind me and chew like an untrained animal. Life is too short to make myself inconvenient over meals, right? It was not that easy though. Mom would not come to my door to force me to come out like I always expected, instead, she would take away $20 out of my monthly allowance. It used to hurt but it no longer does. I don't know why. Maybe it is because as a grown up twenty four year old young man now, i have a job to call my own, and i do not need her allowance, or maybe it hurt more because even the person who gave me the allowance was no more. Mom died when I was seventeen. Everything in the story of my past is weird coz what mom loved doing was what killed her. It was a Christmas morning, and we were eating spicy meals like hot pepperoni, pizza , chicken casserole with spicy soups and mom, like her usual routine was, had to chew silently. My sister was only ten but she's always been this gentle, obedient and caring little angel and was the closest to mom. So on this fateful day, she was sitting close to mom at the table, and offering her water and wine when it seemed like she was choking. You see, one thing unique about mom is her laughter. Her laughter's really cute and loud. And of course, infectious. On the table, one of the family friends we invited over said something funny (it wasn't that funny to me, but you know how mom is like), and mom laughed out loud. There was food in her mouth and instead of her to spit it out or swallow with the water Daisy(my little sister) was offering, she preferred to chew silently and dangerously. She choked and died the next day. Her doctor said one of the spices went into her head, went through two wrong passages. So you see, talking about my mom and her death is really uncomfortable for me, but I have to, because I need these scary dreams I've been having for the past one week to stop. My grandma did say I needed to unwind. Pour out my mind and the dreams will go. Yes! My grandma. My grandma is the major reason I'm writing this story. My grandma came into the picture after mom died. She came to live with us because Dad had become a shadow of himself. He sometimes swore that someone definitely poisoned her meal that Christmas morning. He didn't care that his assumption was silly and totally untrue. He was going crazy everyday. He even began talking to her at 2am instead of observing his dance ritual. One day when I couldn't take it anymore, i called my sister and had a tete-a-tete talk with her. ""What do we do?"" I asked , ""Should we ask him to go with us to her grave? Or drive him to her grave at 2am every morning?"" Maybe that'd make him connect with her and start dancing again instead of worrying and groping around the house.  Even me sounded silly in my ears but there was nothing I could do. ""No that will make him worse"" my not-so-little sister Daisy chided, ""don't be silly, Mac""""What do you think we should do then?  I asked impatiently""Let's kill him"" Immediately I heard those words tumble out of her mouth, I started to get chills.""What?"" I almost yelled but she covered my mouth quickly""Look, Mac, I love Dad, but ...he loves mom more. Daddy will never get better. You know how much he loves her, and how much he misses her now that she's gone"" My face read horror. What the hell was my sister talking about? Where did I meet all these strange people that I find it hard to call 'my' family? Why am I different? Was I adopted?Different thoughts started to run through my mind and at that instant, I got up and made for the door. I was done talking with Daisy. But her words forced me back into the room.""I have here with me dad's written plans about his upcoming suicide and willing of his properties to one person I do not know, that you do not know either"" My mouth was wide agape. This was horror in reality. ""What did you say?"" I asked, sitting again.She handed me five notes that were a bit rumpled and with shaky hands, I grabbed them and began to skim the surface. He indeed had plans to kill himself and will his properties to one Margret Miller. That was definitely our relative because we had the same surname 'Miller' but who was Margaret? It remained a mystery until five months later when Margaret Miller herself walked into the house in her five feet, twelve two inches petiteness.  Margaret Miller was our grandma!She was his mother. On the night of her arrival, she was smiling so much I started to fear her. In fact I think everything about her is unreal. Her perfect white teeth, her black hair and her young shape and straight back, too good to be true for a seventy year old! She could pass for my sister's elder sister, say like someone in her late twenties.I'm sure she used potions to make herself younger. Honestly if you saw her, you'd think she was a spinster. That's overly artificial!  She had no wrinkles, no bad teeth, no bent back and she was very agile even younger looking than my mom was, in her lifetime. When she came, she told us children, Daisy and I: ""Don't worry children. Now that I am here, your father will be happy again, and you kids will be able to cope with your grief better"". Yes, ""your"" grief, that's what she said. It seemed to me she never liked mom marrying her son. She might have even killed her even, except for the fact that we all had evidence of what killed her.After sitting us down like that, she turned the store into a personal untouchable room. She painted the front of the door and wrote in block letters""INTANGIBLE"". She told us not to ever enter the room or touch the door and she also said even if we tried to open it, it would not be there, hence the name Intangible.  And indeed it was true. We never were able to touch the door or open it.  Every morning, my grandma would go to the kitchen , lock the door from inside and spend at least an hour there, come out, go into 'Intangible', and spend another hour there, then she'd finally come out with freshly baked, sweet-smelling cakes. She fed dad with these cakes every morning before he went to work. And every night before he went to bed.  Soon, dad started to get a little hyper excited. He'd come home and hug us both, make us lunch, take us out and bathe three times a day. He resumed dancing at 2am and many other weird but 'happy' things. I secretly preferred his gloomy self to this hyper guy.  The cakes did magic. I wondered for months what ingredient grandma used to bake her cakes. I wondered how a piece of bread could make one overcome grief in less than two weeks.  Dad didn't remember Mom anymore. He didn't talk about her or acted like she was ever alive.  One day, I asked grandma what ingredients she used in baking, and her answer was, ""Baking powder, yeast, flour, butter, sugar"" Tchhh the usual. I looked at her and said , ""I meant what extra ingredient do you use? This seems to me, not a usual baking"" She touched my shoulder warmly and said ""Happy cakes come from ""Intangible"", and they make one happy and young"" Bingo!!That's what made her look so young! I wonder how long she's been eating ""Happy cakes"" from ""Intangible"". I wonder what would happen to me if i ate that cake everyday.  ""Mama, can I go into Intangible with you and see how you bake these Happy cakes?""  I asked.  ""No darling. Only Mama can enter"" That's when I stopped pestering her to let me go with her, not that I was bold enough to yield if she said yes. I was just really curious. One day I went into the kitchen to steal one of dad's happy cakes made my grandma.  I took a pinch and smelt it. It smelt normal. Smelt like something sweet. I was so afraid to taste it. So I dumped it in the bin. Not long after, I went back in there and stole a larger piece. Grandma baked her cakes in such a way that it was shapeless, so if you cut from it, it wouldn't be so obvious. I took the piece of cake to school and gave it to a boy in my class who liked food. He was a chubby rich boy.. but he was always sad because he got bullied everyday. He was infact depressed. He ate those cakes and thanked me. Every week I gave him these cakes and on the third week, this boy's countenance changed. He was happier than ever and he started to lose all the extra fat. His parents came to school to thank his teachers and gave them tips. As for me, I was shocked and wondered if i had helped the boy or destroyed his life. Two years later, on a cold night, i ran away from home. Everything was so strange to me I was almost going mad. I started to cut myself and went for therapy. I refused to eat Mama's cakes even tho it was potent. I refused to eat her cakes because the little fragile baby wrapped in a cot I saw that night can't be my sister. Daisy, a teenager! How could she have turned into a baby or maybe Grandma was teasing me because every time I asked her where Daisy was, she'd point to the little child and say, ""Here, this is your little sister. Now I can have babies to carry again. Now I can get married and live a new young life again""   I fled from ""Intangible"" , fled from my family and went into therapy. Till today, i do not know my grandma's secret ingredient for her cakes. All I know is, I'll never eat any of it. Or give it to a chubby boy. Not ever.

Secrets?  Sure I know secrets.  I read a book on them once upon a time.,"People dont read like they used to. That is for sure. When I was lost one year. I think it was 1984 here which means 1976 to me there I was in Disneyland. First and only time I was there. I was like eight or nine, maybe.I had gotten lost in the Halls of Presidents. Now in Disneyland there is a secret passages everywhere. And? Well, I saw a Disney character go into one of the passageways. My parent was elsewhere and? Well, I like exploring it is probably why I am lost most of my life.Anyway, I go into this hallway. Cement floors and a corridor going down into an underground passage ways. Like a pirate, I went off exploring. Figuring at this age that maybe Captain Hook had left something for me.So like most of my problem is remembering where I am at. Meaning? I am not an idiot. I counted one right turn etc. Figuring how to get back if I had to. After the fifteenth turn seeing the employees lunch room. No one was there. Finding the custom changing room. Blush, I walked in on Cinderella and some old guy fondling her. When she saw me, she screamed. The guy looked pretty busy trying to get his pants up.I figured it was time to take 15 left turns to get back upstairs. Well. That is a dilemna not dilemma in my reality. Meaning?I ended up in some private movie theatre. And? Well, they were watching the premier of the Black Cauldron. So? Well, there was a guy that looked like Disney there and several other people. One I remember and recognize when I got lost elsewhere. Anyway they were watching and talking about how the ending was bad.Meaning? Well, in the movie I saw. Meaning I sat down. I had no clue as to who was in the dark, and I was not interested being caught by Cinderella.They were talking about the ending. Meaning? Well, I got to see the movie after that. In the one I saw the witches boiled someone and the kid kept the sword and became some ruler of the Skeletons kingdom or ah yes now I remember my memory was the villain called the Horn King or something like that.So anyway, the original one I saw the kid for whatever nonsense became just like the Skeleton or Horn King for whatever reason. And I think the movie they boiled the dog.They were talking about how the music was praise worth and wondering how much they would have to pay critics to praise this evil ending.Then the lights came on. The guy evidently finally got his pants up because he ran into the theatre. The guy that looked like Disney turned to him and asked what he thought of the movie. And that was when I left.Now you might say. Silly, the movie you are talking about did not come out in 1976. All I can say is what I remember. And the secret ingredient was a dog.Now getting out of there, I ran. And ran. When I stopped running, I recognized where the heck I was at. I was somehow climbing the stair case for the Pirates of the Caribbean entrance to the dining area that one floats by when you are on the ride.So I somehow ending up almost like half way across the park in my little movie adventure. At this time I, being a nine or ten-year-old kid, realized how screwed or lost I was and went to find someone to ask for help to find my parent.Well, that did not work out so good. Evidently my adventure was recorded on some close circuit television thing. I ended up with the guy that looked like Disney.The conversation was spooky. He asked at the end what I had thought of the movie? I bluntly said I liked the dog better than the main character why not throw the main character into the pot instead and boil him?It was a rather long day at this time. My parent had started the search for me and I ended up being talked to. My parent at that time had to sign some papers, and I was forbidden to talk about anything.Years later I heard that the guy with his pants down got caught doing thing with a lady on the elevator that is in the Cinderella castle in Florida. This story of course, being in California.I always wondered if that movie did not make any sense because the one I saw seemed like a pretty solid story and the one I saw afterwards seemed dark and disjointed.As for the dog coming back to life, that part I liked. Years later, I meet one of the people that was sitting in that room elsewhere. He was a changed man. Seemed scared for his life.Why? He talked about things that made no sense to me. Like a train from Orlando Airport right to Disney World. How that the Empire State Building had once upon a time had an Evil Cafe. And the evil villains were made to look like good characters and public was sold on the idea.He even went as far as talking about a book Disney had gotten which was magical. Where from? No idea the story teller just told about how Disney had purchased a book right after losing Oswald. Now this is the problem for me. I had to ask who Oswald was. Evidently Disney story was different. I remember business college how Disney first character had been Mortimer Mouse. That you do not sign anything unless you are sure you know what it means or you could lose it was the moral of that college leature . So I guess I the guy was from elsewhere or my college professor was nuts. One or the other. Anyways, meaning the guy talked about how Disney had opened a book from Chaldeans time. And if you were stupid or evil enough, you could just poof things into existence. Seemed rather far fetched. Even where we were talking, which was a Skiff room doing a bizarre secret project with sound and light. Meaning? If you have not guested it yet. We all are avatars in some absurd game. Laughter. No really you dont believe me do you? The secret is we all eat plants. And plants are made out of light. And wola the secret ingredient of life are light making you nothing more than an avatar. Which is sad because unless you are playing pirate usually life is boring. Making me think whoever is playing me has a fate for me. The question is it I am pot asking God why I was made this way? Or a person kicked out of heaven for a dress code? Or am I just a traveling spirit telling you that you are nothing more than light? Shh.. Keep the secret to yourself until you ask what the key is. The key? Sure. After hearing that absurd story about Disney World and a book. I had to find the book. And? I know the where about in 1997. Since then? The storage area might have burnt down, who knows. Was I stupid enough to read the book? Read the Secret of Light and then comment what you think."
Chief Scientist VS Master Chef,"It was dark inside the science lab dining hall. All the lights were off. No voice can be heard of spoons or food pouring in plates or chit chatting of scientists while eating dinner. But it was dinner time in the Science lab. In fact its 9:00 pm. Whereas dinner time starts at 8:00 pm. And still no sound is coming out from the science lab dining hall.But why???? Today was supposed to be a big dinner arrangement in the dining hall. The chief scientist of this country, who was the most brilliant scientist ever born in this country, was coming to this science laboratory for an annual dinner. He had also received numerous awards from the government for his great inventions.A 7 star chef was hired today for making a perfect delicious and memorable dinner for this scientist. This chef has worked in the kitchen of Queen Elizabeth of England. He was the favorite chef of the queen. The Queen has also honored him with the title Sir when he made 90 dishes on the 90 birthday of the Queen. Each dish was a representation out of the 200 nations on which England has ruled in the 18 and 19 century. Each dish was made deliberately taking in consideration the taste buds of the Queen and then selecting the famous cultural dish of that nation.The queen was sitting on the royal dining table with a tiny fork and a sharp knife in her hands. The royal servants were serving the 90 dishes one by one...hot, hot , the dishes were coming directly from the kitchen without a break.It was a hard challenge for the chef. All the other royal chefs rejected this challenge saying it's impossible. As the chef had to be vigilant with his time management, cooking skills, presentation analysis and above all in accordance with the eating time of the queen. As all the dishes had to be served one by one and directly from the oven once the Queen was done eating with one dish.But chef Gulzar took this as a challenge for himself to prove his abilities not only to the world but to himself also.He accepted the challenge !!! knowing the perils of this challenge.and what it can lead to... it might cost a long prison in the jail for not coming up to the mark.Chef Gulzar asked for 4 months of preparation time for this challenge. He made a small plan of action on a small piece of paper. Just to make his plans hidden from everyone. Hidden in his hidden pocket in his underwear. He wrote down his abilities and disabilities being a chef. And then he closely observed the time management strategy. With watchful eyes he used to note down the eating time of the Queen in every bite of her food. And then he started training himself for this big challenge.The Queen was sitting on one end of the royal dining table. The royal dining table was so big that 100 chairs were placed around this table. The table was decorated with a delegate hand embroidered table runner over it. Next to the last 100 chair was the kitchen door. The royal kitchen staff were coming out from that door one by one serving the dishes to the Queen. The queen used to cut a tiny half inch bite from each dish. And then once she is done eating that half inch bite the next dish was supposed to be served.When it was time to eat the cultural dish from Pakistan. The chef chose to make Pakoras for the queen. It's a fried ball made from chickpea flour mixed with onions, green chilies, mint, coriander, salt, red chili flakes, coriander seeds, cumin and egg.The dish was served hot, immediately coming from the frying pot. The knife in the queens hand kissed the crispy surface of the pakora. The outer side of the pakora was extremely crispy while the inner side was soft as rose petals. The knife easily made a cut inside the Pakora. The queen puts the small cut piece of pakora in her fork and now she opens her mouth to eat it. And the minute she chews it in her mouth. Her eyes got wide open. And then shuts as if she eats something very unique and out of this world. The royal servants moved the dish aside now but the Queen makes an order to place this dish back in front of her with her hands. And then the queen says I want to eat the whole dish and would like to end this dinner over here by eating 2 more plates of Pakoras. Plus I want these to be served regularly with my Saturday evening tea.Please call the chef outside as I want to meet him and title him sir for his excellent performance.Chef Gulzar became the most popular and expensive chef in the world after receiving the title sir. He is now known as master chef Sir Gulzar. He left the place after 6 months due to his new busy schedules. As now he was all time busy giving interviews to international media, going on personal planes by the richest Arab sheikhs to cook for them, being called by the countries all over the world to cook in their special dinners.This time also a country whose name has to be kept hidden also hired Chef Gulzar on the request of their finest and the most brilliant atomic scientist. He was the first atomic scientist of this country. So he was not an ordinary scientist. He was a very powerful scientist in this country. Working as a chief scientist the government had to give him respect and to accept all his demands. He was the reason to bring the atomic power to this country.And this time this chief scientist demanded dinner made by the world famous chef sir Gulzar and in this dinner he demanded the chef to make those Pakoras which he made for the queen on her 90 birthday dinner. But why is the dining hall dark from inside with no lights switched on in it...plus its also locked???Where is chef sir Gulzar ?? He came to make this dinner on a private plane given by the government of this countryBut now why is there so much quietness in the dining hall and in the kitchen???......Let's roam around the lab to get some ideas.Some young scientists are smoking outside the building on the lawn.I think it was too much for today the chief should stop thinking of himself as jackal of all the trades all the time.I think the same too he just showed extra arrogance in his behavior todayUuuhh God do you people know. I am so hungry...I hope.. I dont get sulfate and hydrogen for dinner todayYou never know .. As the chief accepted this master challenge from master chef sir Gulzar.Sorry I was late.. I didn't get it Why did he accept this challenge??Why because he is a fool living in a fool's paradise thinking cooking pakoras is just like mixing carbon in water.Just look at his disgusting attitude towards sir Gulzar on tasting his famous Pakoras:This is the most unpleasant, unhealthy food I have ever eaten in my lifeYa did you forget he also said:They look like gigantic nostrils to meOhh God the chief did not even forgive the queen saying:I think the Queen overlooked this in the crowd of 90 tasteless dishes.And this was I guess too much saying:The only truly remarkable thing about this pakora is how remarkably bad they are in taste.I find this line of the chief even more irritating:You can imagine now this isnt something to boast about..If you have anything else to do ...do that for me then.. OOh My the chief said all this to the famous master...master of all the master chefs... sir Gulzar.Yes and guess what???? Sir Gulzar said.??.. keeping his distance of pace with sophistication:Easy-Peasy, o plankton-brain.Did he say plankton- brain to the chief ??Yes .the chief howled while he stood up to have a nose to nose, eyeballing with chef Gulzar:Your pakoras made my mouth run out of taste and now your words are making me run out of patience.This chief thinks everyone is just like us. who wont say anything to him about his misbehavior..but chef Gulzar reacted very well with him in this staring contest.Ya his words were full of dignity, saying:You have gone too far.No one has ever talked like this with me.I had .Had ENOUGH..You think.You know a lot about food and taste..You said the Queen misjudged me..OK..then I CHALLENGE YOU ??????For a Master Challenge then?????To make far more better, yummy, tasty, good, light and delicious Pakoras then mine...I am not going to put my foot down again in the kitchen if you win.Surely the chief was not expecting this fight back attitude.his face got blank as if how could I cookbut everyone was closely watching him for his turn now...I am absolutely sure he might have rejected this challenge if Chef Gulzar had not puffed his face twice his normal size with anger.Ya you are right..just look at his hissing words over this challenge:I will do all these things ...A simple thing making it complex.you might learn a lesson from this challenge then that not everyone is a fool in this world.It's been an hour now and the chief is working all alone in the kitchen while chef Gulzar is waiting for his pakoras in the Vip lounge.To be honest I liked Chef Gulzars idea of making the whole department of atomic science the judge to taste the two pakoras.Let's see now what happens and who wins?1 hour has gone and only 1 more hour is left.   Lets sneak peep in the kitchen nowMaybe we might find something deliciously cooking up.. Oooohhh that baby chef thinks I dont know anything about food or healthI will surely teach him a lesson. What it takes to get rude with me.What this pakora...let me open my YouTube to get its recipe and then I will invent my own new recipe just like all the other great inventions I have made.I think this grandma teaching this recipe sounds good..as Grandmas are always the best chef. Welcome to Grandma channel.where everything you eat is made by Grandma Love.So my children today I am going to teach you how to make delicious Pakoras.I used to make these Pakoras for my husband when he was an army officer.he used to call my Pakoras .. Juliet pakoras.you might be thinking Juliet???? Yes my children Juliet..as he says he fell in love with me like a Romeo after eating the pakoras made by me when I was young.Before I start off my recipe dont forget to hit the bell icon and also to like and subscribe to my YouTube channel.Note down the ingredients:1 cup chickpea powder2 green chilies choppedSmall amount of water for mixing1 potato chopped1 onion choppedSalt as per taste.Mix all these ingredients and then with a help of a spoon start pouring this mixture one by one in a pan filled with hot oil. We have to deep fry these balls. When they start getting golden in color just take them out from the oil.And here you go, your Juliet pakoras are ready to make someone fall in love with you. The government is already in love with me Grandma..Now this chef is going to taste the real magic of my hands.hhmm what an unhealthy food without any proteins in it and then deep fry it to make you fat..Ooh God this Grandma doesn't know about Air Fryers. We need to Air Fry instead of deep fry these days to kill extra oil fat from the food .. I think I should use non refined chickpea flour with flour Beetle in it give a touch of protein in it and then Air fry it... to make my dish far more healthy in nature then that puffy face chef made dish.I will also add more vegetables in it and will mix it with cheese and milk instead of water.Chief mixed the Beetle chickpea flour with onions, tomatoes, green chilies, jalapeno, mushroom, potato, egg plant, spinach, corns, olives, bitter gourd.I dont want to make my dish look like some dragon eyeballs so why not pour the whole mixture in the frying pot of the Air Fryer and then cut it in small pieces afterwards.Now you will know what real food tastes like...Inventing and inventions are just tricks of my hands..and today I am inventing a new dish in this world I think it would add an extra point to my CV now Let's pour the mixture now..Hey what's going on, why is this mixture leaking down the grill in the fryerMake be because Pakora mixture is even new with this new race of pakoras building up in themLet's put the timer on for 20 minutes. The fryer bell rings.Oohh my pakoras are ready, let me take a look at my latest invention.Ohh god why has this mixture stuck tight with the frying grill..it's not getting out.it's even black in color from outside.I should taste it.. It would surely be better in taste than his pakorasAaaaaaaaaaahhhh yuckyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. Tuu tuuu.I need some water.it is neither sour nor salt in fact it tastes bitter.Oohh God.what should I do now..its almost 2 hours now...  Suddenly there is a knock at the kitchen door. Now a young man enters the kitchen. Sir.. your 2 hours have finished...Now its time to meet your challenge...may I help in taking your dish to the dining room. Ohh my dish.. Oh no oh yes its here...no no..its there. Listen, just give me a few more minutes??...in a confused terrified voice the chief requested. No sir.Chef Gulzar is waiting Oohh please are you not my brother you look just like my brother.tell that chef anything just for 20 more minutes..pleaseeeeeeee. No sir it's unethical. said the young man with a clear voice. Its not getting out of the Air Fryer... the chief cried Please get aside so that I can take this fryer then in front of the judges OK then tell Chef Gulzar I am in the washroom and will join him after 10 minutes. Chef Gulzar looked at the frying Dish in the Air fryer with shiny eyes and a hidden smile on his face.Everyone started tasting the two pakora dishes.Some vomited, some had a tooth break down, some got a bad bowel movement and horrible of all some even felt a minor heart attack on eating this hard stone like bitterly bad tasteless pakoras made by the chief Scientist. Now Everyone was waiting for the chief to give an explanation of what he had cooked. But there came a noise of a plane taking off instead of the chief coming. And when it was investigated why a private plane of the chief took off without any call. It revealed that the chief had flown away in that plane just now.Chef Gulzar laughed on hearing this and simply said :The work suits in the hands of the one skilled to do it."
Mabsoot,"One day, not too long ago the people in a village were sad. Its not that they were unhappy; not really. They had forgotten how to laugh. Its as simple as that. They couldnt find joy in little things anymore. In fact, they were so sad all the time that a dark fog had engulfed the whole village: and they didnt even notice.Then on another day, a little elf came to that village: the sweetest, cutest elf you could ever imagine. And guess what? He thought them how to laugh again. He showed them how to find joy in every day little things.Little by little the fog over the village lifted and let the sun shone brightly through. The people started feeling better: they greeted each other when they met in the street, they were able to stop and marvel at their surroundings: they smiled again!They insisted on the little elf staying with them. But you see: the little elf had blown in from the desert. He had kind of a nomadic soul. He loved his sand dunes where he would converse with genies and animals, big and tiny. However, after long debate the little elf decided to stay and make it his mission to see that the people in the village remained happy and didnt fall back into their old ways.The people built him a little house; the sweetest, cutest you could ever imagine. Little elf opened up an eating saloon and he really enjoyed himself. All morning he would make and bake the most delicious food. People couldnt get enough of his colourful cabbage soup after a hard workday. Refresh themselves with rainbow milk and have banana pudding for dessert. They would talk to each other and help each other out when somebody needed help. On such days little elf would make chocolate salami because children especially loved that. On special holidays he would create 1001 tiramisus. It was a magical experience! Its not that the food made them fly on a broom or something. But the delight of little elfs food chased away even the darkest of thoughts!Then, on yet another day at dusk the burgomaster came running into the saloon. Little elf was preparing spinach pancakes for breakfast:- Morning mister Burgomaster.The Burgomaster seemed very upset; he didnt even answer the little elfs greeting.He was indeed very worried.- Oh my, mister Burgomaster you look white as a ghosts sheet! What on earth is the matter? Please do sit down and let me get you some upside-down cake. It will make you feel better. Boy, oh boy: you look mighty upset! said little elf.But the Burgomaster kept huffing and puffing. - No! no please.Little elf noticed that he stood shaking on his legs.- D dr. dragon! Little elf looked at the Burgomaster in wonder.- A dragon is here? Thats wonderful! said little elf and he made a jump for joy.- I shall prepare a princely banquet to welcome him!The burgomaster started to shake his head violently:- No! have you lost your mind?The little elf furrowed his brows.- Why? You dont like the dragon? little elf asked. He gave the Burgomaster a glass of sweet water so he could catch his breath and regain his strength. - He came out of nowhere. He flew over spitting fire left and right! cried the Burgomaster.- Calm yourself, good man! Let me get you some hedgehog cheesecake perhaps.- No! No! No! the burgomaster shouted, We have to come up with a plan to kill this dragon!Now the little elf started crying: Oh my! Kill? You cant possibly be serious mister Burgomaster!- Yes! Yes, I am! Profoundly serious! the Burgomaster answered in a serious and very loud voice!The little elf was really worried now.- No! No, mister Burgomaster! he said in a firm voice. This puzzled the Burgomaster.- No killing! For all we know, the dragon is already gone. Come look and see mister Burgomaster. The sky is pink: isnt that beautiful? Im sure it will be such a lovely day today. Why spoil it? little elf came from behind the counter and took the burgomaster to the window.- First you will eat, and then we can go look at that burned field, what do you say mister burgomaster?The Burgomaster found that he was indeed hungry, so he sat down and enjoyed the spiced chai tea, and some bacon cinnamon rolls little elf served him.When everybody had their breakfast, they all went to look at the damage the dragon had caused together. A wave of warm air blew towards them, and the smell of smoke filled their nostrils, but the dragon was nowhere to be seen. Maybe the dragon really had moved on. All the people started to tend to the burned field and then went on about their day. The next morning: the burgomaster came running in again while little elf was putting some croissants in the oven. The dragon did it again! Something had to be done!Little elf calmed the Burgomaster and promised that as soon as the croissants were done, he would set out to see if he could find this dragon and talk to him. Or her because there were lady dragons as well.- Talk to that bea st? You? the burgomaster started biting his nails, he always did that when he was scared.- Why not? said little elf, I remember some of dragons tongue.- What if he eats you? Burgomaster cried.- He wont! replied little elf, besides: I dont think I taste that good.Little elf quickly prepared the breakfast plates for his regular customers and off he went, in search for the dragon. The people in the village kind of expected little elf never to come back again. They all got together in the saloon hoping for the best. Little elf stopped by a cave at the top of a hill and peaked inside. A burning smell filled the air; so, he was sure he was on the right track. Before long he could hear snoring.- Oh boy, oh boy. He thought, I sure hope that dragon is friendly when I wake him up.- Uhumm uhumm. Little elf coughed when he found the sleeping dragon.The dragon opened one eye.-Uhumm uhumm. Little elf tried again.Now the dragon opened his other eye. And no! he did not look friendly!- Good morning mister Dragon. I brought you some breakfast. Said little elf. But the dragon didnt respond too well and started spitting big flames.- Awchhhh! cried little elf, I didncome here to be turned into shish kebab! Please dont do that again! Look: I brought you something!The dragon gave little elf a truly angry look, but at least he stopped spitting fire.- I thought you might be hungry little elf had to cough because of the smoke that filled the cave.I made you some banana blue berry breakfast cookies.Little elf held them out to the dragon so he could smell them. The dragon sniffed and then: ate them all up in one go.- Is it okay if I sit down here mister dragon? I would love to talk to you. The dragon was licking up the last crumbs of the breakfast cookies and looked at the little elf.- You are scaring all the people in the village, mister dragon. That is not a very nice thing to do now, is it?Oh, oh the dragon started to look angry again.- I hate humans! he roared very loudly. They kill dragons. He roared again, only this time so loud the ground started shaking.- Please calm yourself. Little elf begged, Im so sorry about that! I truly am. But you have to understand you scare them, and humans tend to destroy whatever scares them.- Got any more of those cookies? the dragon barked.- Im sorry, little elf shook his head I can get you some more! Im so glad you liked them.- Yes! Theyre very tasty. Said the dragon while he licked up last crumb.- What if I promise you that the people of this village will not harm you: will you stop burning their fields?The dragon just sat there staring at little elf.- Whats your name? dragon finally asked.- Mabsoot, but everybody calls me little elf.- I like Mabsoot better! said the dragon, It means happy!Little elf started to giggle: Yes! It does!!- Are you happy? dragon asked with a little sadness in his voice.- I try my best every day. Said little elf.- How? growled the dragon. Little elf was startled.- Well I smile a lot! And I try to make others smile as well! I walk a lot in the woods gathering ingredients; I like good food and I love to cook! And I like to sleep as well.- On the rare occasions where I am bored, little elf continued I go see my friends. But mostly they come to me.The dragon was listening with great interest:- You know dragon: happiness comes from within. When I wake up, I choose to be an optimist. I treat everybody like a friend.- And that works for you? the dragon interrupted.- It sure does. You should try it!- Hmm groaned the dragon, why dont you start by giving me a few more cookies?- Oh, my dragon, you ate them all. But Ill tell you what!The dragon was curious about what his new found friend was going to come up with, so he sat up and listened carefully.- I will go back to the village now and I will tell everybody what a nice dragon you are. That deep down youre not so different from them. Not too long ago, they were just like you.- Hmm? They can spit fire too? Dragon wondered.- Not exactly, said little elf, they forgot how to smile, they forgot how to appreciate the little things. They would brood all day and ignore all the beauty around them. They neglected each other because they had forgotten all about friendship.- Hummm . Said the dragon again, You think this is going to work? They wont come cut my head off in the middle of the night?- Dragon! There you go again; think a happy thought and try to be excited about all the new friends youre going to make! little elf stood up and continued: I will arrange a welcoming party for you! Lets say at sunset I will put up torches everywhere and maybe you can light them up. You seem to do a good job with fire. They both had to laugh.- Well, if you think so. Said dragon.- I do! little elf clapped his hands for joy. He hurried back to the village where an anxious Burgomaster was awaiting him. He told him everything the dragon had agreed to.The Burgomaster was a little worried about this plan, but he was prepared to give little elfs dragon a chance.All afternoon little elf was busy in the kitchen. He needed sugar, milk, vanilla, and eggs. Green apples, blue berries, violet figs, and purple eggplant. Pink watermelons and dragon fruit of course! Oranges, grapes, pineapples, and mangos. Yellow bananas and pears and kiwis.He made a whole lot of unicorn cupcakes and spring cake sickles for the children. And he brewed enough magic butterfly pea lemonade for everybody.By the time the sun was starting to set, all the people had gathered in and around little elfs saloon. They were waiting for the dragon and some of them were scared. But they trusted little elf and replaced their bad thoughts with positive ones. Finally, they could hear the sound of flapping wings. Dragon landed on a spot especially designated to him. He looked a little suspicious at first. But then one by one the people started to bid hi m welcome, so he relaxed.- Friends! shouted little elf, let me introduce to you my new friend, who now wants to be your friend too!- Hes no longer going to burn our field down? a loud voice in the crowd yelled.Little elf looked at dragon who was shaking his head in a very solemn manor.- Or eat our babies? a woman asked.Dragon kept shaking his head.- Dragon! little elf called out, do the honours please!The dragon took a position from where he could blow over the torches and they all lid up. This startled the people, but they all soon started to clap their hands.Dragon especially loved the rainbow cake! Oh yes, he did! He had eighteen slices!He played with the children all night, until he was so tired, he simply fell asleep. When he woke up the next morning his tummy was a little sore because of all the rainbow cake and other goodies he had the previous night. At first, he didnt know where he was, but it came back to him soon. He stretched himself so that all sleep could fly from his limbs. And then he spat in the sky.Aiaiai. He wasnt supposed to do that anymore. He bowed his head in shame because he had forgotten his promise. Then he heard children laughing and clapping and pointing at the sky. His gaze followed the direction of their little fingers, and when he looked up at the sky, he saw the most radiant rainbow he had ever seen. - Such happy colours! the dragon thought to himself. The children all wanted to hug the dragon at the same time. Mabsoot looked at everything from his kitchen window, where he was already making the next rainbow cake.A little kindness can be so beautiful. The world is such a beautiful palette and dragon became the village rainbow maker. Rainbows apologize for a lot of things! Dragon would get his own rainbow cake and a glass of magical lemonade for many years to follow. And people from wide and far would come marvel at his arc of magnificent colours and hope!"
Louis and Sandra,"As the autumn sun began to descend a small smile crept across Sandras face. Although her Sunday evening routine wasnt new, it never failed to give her a sense of purpose or a warm, fuzzy feeling in her tummy. She cheerily called upstairs, Im going to make a start now! then lifted herself out of the cosy armchair and made her way into the heart of the house.This was her favourite room and it was set up just as she wanted it- everything to hand- some might say messy but it made things easy for her.She rummaged through the crowded kitchen draw until she found her trusty, well-loved note book and turned its curled form over to a fresh page. Timings, timings, the sands of time wait for no man she muttered to herself as she began to write out the timings for the different components of the meal.Each week she would try something new- she once read it was important in a relationship to try different things and show you werent complacent and her and Louis had always prided themselves on that throughout their years of marriage.She prized open the stiff fridge door and grabbed the ingredients she needed for the Thai beef curry before laying them out neatly on the kitchen counter top. Just as she started chopping the onions, she paused - was Louis calling her? She shouted up the stairs and waited, but no response- what she could hear was the football match she had put on for him earlier. Men and their sports she chuckled to herself and resumed chopping. As the onions began to sting her eyes, her mind darted through all the relatable memories and thoughts-personal and universal: her teenage years where she cut them with a spoon in her mouth, the time her dad had jokingly donned swimming goggles, of course the quotable childhood film onions have layers and finally the sad story of the man who- suddenly her thoughts were halted by the harsh sound of the doorbell.She rinsed her hands and patted them on her dress before opening the door. The golden, damp of the autumn air was a welcome comparison to the stuffy central heating and the heat of the kitchen. She looked down. A small brown parcel sat on the front step and Sandra tried to wave to the Amazon delivery driver who was speeding off for his next drop. Was waving the done thing these days? She often felt out of touch with social interactions in recent times, but tried not to dwell on this as it was a vicious circle to say the least... *************She locked the door and placed the safety train across, there would be no need to go outside for the rest of the evening she assured herself. Now where was I?.... she checked the recipe card for the dish, collected the dry ingredients out of the cupboard and grabbed the oil. She fried the onions cautiously , trying her best to get them golden and not burnt before adding the rich, fragrant spices. Trains of thought arrived and left the station of Sandras mind as she continued to prepare the Sunday meal- fleeting ones,silly ones, to do list ones and sentimental, nostalgic ones Most people would think her silly for putting so much thought into cooking this type of meal on a Sunday night every week, but they didnt know the ways in which Louis had supported her over the years without fail. This was her little way of saying thank you.With the saucepan sizzling, she carefully opened the plastic packaging and separated the hefty chunks of beef- oh how she hated the smell of the uncooked meat! After quickly adding them to the saucepan, she throughly washed her hands, slightly burning them in her attempt to remove all traces of raw meat before setting about making the creamy coconut curry sauce. While the curry was bubbling away nicely,Sandra wiped down all the kitchen counter tops and began to prepare the table settings. For someone who lacked finesse, she made sure everything was laid out just-so for the Sunday dinner: plates, cutlery, serviettes and a few candles for a sense of occasion. She stepped back proudly and took in the setting - just one thing missing she mused as she commanded Apple home to play a dinner party playlist. Sandra entered back into the kitchen and gave the curry one last stir- yes, her hour and a half of toiling was well spent- it smelt delicious. She heated the sticky rice she had prepared and was ready to dish up.....Dinners ready Louis she whispered gently, voice trailing as she poured herself a large glass of White wine.************ With dinner finished and the plates cleared away, Sandra drained the last dregs of wine for her glass before adding it to the dishwasher and wearily making her way up the stairs.On the landing, photos of their children and grandchildren met her tired eyes and she smiled must FaceTime them tomorrow she mentally noted, although she appreciated this was difficult with the time difference.With a full tummy, she took her time getting ready for bed, finding enjoyment in the multi step skin care routine her friend Jackie had got her for a pick- me-up present.After changing into her pyjamas, she turned off the TV she had put on earlier in the afternoon.Sitting on the edge of the bed she reached her hand over to Louiss side. Did you like your dinner darling? She said softly looking at a photo of them from over 10 years ago placed on the bedside table. 6 years without him and she still cooked for both of them- only on a Sunday now. As she got under the covers and curled up on her side she hoped her dreams would lead her to him once again- the sands of time wait for no man, but in dreams, we can go back and leave more footprints in them...."
The Fosse or the Fly?,"I remember that very first evening feeling feverish, sweat running down my back leaving the telltale damp patch down the centre of my clean shirt.  I was unfortunately seated close to a crackling oak log fire which didnt help matters, but I was too polite, too English to ask to move to another seat.  My hand trembled as I reached out to select a few potato crisps and soft cheese apericubes from the array of nibbles Madame Dubois had prepared as an aperitif. It was our first invitation to dinner since we had moved permanently to France. Our new home sat on the outskirts of what is now our village and this was our first opportunity to test our conversational French on our most important hosts.  My wife and I had spent the previous twelve months immersed in the language from Teach Yourself French CDs and attending night school twice a week.  The invitation came quite unexpectedly from Monsieur and Madame Dubois who were our second nearest neighbours. I had been called upon with some urgency that morning to help divert a stampede of cows that were heading up the narrow lane towards the prized organic pig enclosure belonging to Monsieur Dubois. Sitting here at this splendid table my wife had noticed that I was looking a little off colour and was trying to attract my attention. My lip-reading skills unfortunately had deserted me as she mouthed something to me from the other end of the dining room table. All I could do was to shake my head in response. She responded with a facial expression which over time I understood to be I dont believe you! I ignored any further attempts she made to communicate with me as I dared not say how I was really feeling! This meal could be the most monumental moment in our new life as our hosts were the most important people in the village. Monsieur Dubois was the Mairie! Conversation was kept at a basic level as we were in rural Brittany and the local language was a mixture of French, Breton and Gallo and the lessons wed spent so much time on were failing as our hosts could hardly understand a word we said! However, we managed to get by with hand gestures and mime.  Our friendship albeit tenuous at this early stage was tested when I tried to explain the art of paint spray can painting and the need to shake the can vigorously prior to use and used mime and hand gesture to explain. There was a sudden hush as Mr. Dubois computed my gestures. His face contorted with every thought from deep wonderment, surprise and finally to a guttural laugh as he realised what I had meant by my actions. From what could have been a complete disaster turned out to be an ice breaker moment! Earlier that morning, a car had raced down our drive towards the house. It was a sandy coloured Renault 4 Quatrelle. The driver skidded to a halt on the gravel adding to the list of jobs I had to do that day and the lady who was driving shouted something to me which by her tone meant for me to get into the car. She drove a short distance to where I met Monsieur Dubois for the first time at the entrance to his farm. I offered my hand in friendship, but Monsieur Dubois was in a state of panic.  he shouted pointing up the lane.  He took me to the centre of the tarmac and stood upright with his arms outstretched to the sides.  . I obeyed his request. He then took up the same stance about 10 meters away at the entrance to his farm.  The driver of the Quatrelle introduced herself as Madame Dubois, she explained as best she could that a herd of cows were stampeding from another farm and were heading our way. She explained that I was to stay in position and guide the stampeding cows down the middle lane away from the farms entrance.  I spotted a cloud of dust in the distance and that cloud was heading in our direction at some speed! Within a few seconds I saw the first cows just ahead of the dust cloud, there was no other word for it than stampede!  From my quick calculation I counted at least thirty cows were heading in our direction.  Madame Dubois stood in front of me with her arms outstretched sideways whilst holding a piece of broken tree branch in each hand.  she said and explained that the branches would extend my reach and make me appear larger to the stampeding cows. This, she continued, should either stop them in their tracks or cause them to divert away from Monsieur Dubois prized pig enclosure and the problem would pass. We listened to the rumble of the cows as they headed towards the farm. Monsieur Dubois shouted ! It was at this point that I wished I was wearing my brown corduroy trousers and a modicum of aftershave to mask any odour should I lose total control!  The cows were charging towards us up the lane. I glanced over to Monsieur Dubois to reaffirm my readiness and spotted him ducking down behind the corner of his barn. With no chance of stopping the cows I ran to the side of the lane where there was a mud bank and a concrete electricity pole.  I pressed myself against the pole as the cows stampeded past buffeting me against the mud bank as their huge bodies collided with mine.  After promising that Id never eat another steak, the noise had stopped and the cows had passed. I wondered over the lane through the haze of dust left by the cows. I could not see my own hand in front of me. I heard a horn sound and felt a breeze pass very close by; it was La Poste our undiagnosed maniac postman late for his deliveries or was he chasing the cows?  I saw Monsieur and Madame Dubois emerge from behind the barn; they both hugged me pronouncing I was a Hero for saving their even though they had both deserted me leaving me well and truly in the ! I was invited in to their farmhouse where we sat around the old battered kitchen table and Monsieur Dubois opened a bottle of homemade cider which looked like a very large sample one would take to the doctors to have tested! I drank several glasses of the cloudy liquid before I was whisked off to tour of the farm.  We went into a shed that contained approximately one hundred pigs which were for  he declared. The stench took me by surprise and during the first sharp intake of breath breathed in what felt like a small fly which hit the back of my throat. Rather than just spit it out, I swallowed and coughed to dislodge it.  We came out of the rear shed door and found ourselves ankle deep in pig slurry. As Monsieur Dubois took a step backwards, a jet of the foul-smelling slurry squirted from under his boot and hit me directly in my face, entering my mouth. As this was no time for manners and tried desperately to eject the liquid from my mouth. I inevitably swallowed some of the liquid which, on second thoughts would give the fly something to do whilst waiting to be naturally ejected from my body.  I was invited along with Madame Race, my wife, to dine that evening at 7.00pm. Madame Dubois drove me home and I started raking all the gravel back to where it belonged prior to her earlier visit! At the dining table, I was beginning to feel worse, my neck was getting stiff and I felt as if I had flu like symptoms. Madame Dubois placed the main course into the centre of the table. The sauce was a shade lighter than battleship grey with mounds of grey meat in the centre.  proclaimed Monsieur Dubois proudly,  I dont know if it was the fever or the prospect of eating langue du boeuf but I was now sweating profusely. I fished out the smallest of slices of meat, which turned out to be a complete cows tongue complete with taste buds and took some potatoes to accompany it. I sliced into the meat, metaphorically held my nose and forked the dripping grey slice into my mouth. I could feel the cows taste buds on my own taste buds, it was awful, it felt like the cows tongue was licking the inside of my mouth!  We both managed to finish the meal despite being offered second helpings because my wife had said it tasted marvellous and with the help of lashings of red wine was feeling slightly better. At the end of the evening following two glasses of cerise brandy we wobbled our way back down the lane to our home, happy that we could now count the Mairie and his wife as our friends. It was 3.00am when I awoke, my throat badly swollen. I took some paracetamol hoping for some relief and a short while later fell asleep.  I woke again at 9.30am, my mouth was watering constantly, my head was splitting, and I could not swallow. I tried to drink some water but it just ran from the sides of my mouth, my throat had completely closed up! I constantly had to spit saliva from my mouth. Id lost most of my energy and slumped down onto the settee. To prevent myself from running to the bathroom to eject the saliva, I placed a bucket beside me to my wifes dismay. I could no longer speak!I wrote a note asking my wife to call the doctor and got an appointment for that afternoon. Patrick, as he insisted I call him, was fluent in English. My wife explained my symptoms to him. He looked down my throat and felt all around my neck. Hmm he said remodelling his handlebar moustache.  He wrote out a prescription and my wife paid him our twenty euros fee. I quickly scribbled a note on his desk pad; I cannot swallow, and turned it to him. Ahh , he lifted his tongue and pointed below it. Frustration engulfed me, no one understood!  We collected the medication from the pharmacy and made our way home. I slumped on the settee, taking my place next to the bucket and remained there all day. I attempted to take the medication, but this just caused me to dribble even more so was not getting any into my system. By late evening I was tired, my head hurt, I could hardly move my neck and had not eaten or drank for over twelve hours. I dragged myself upstairs which added to the exhaustion.  I fell asleep for a short while but woke up in a panic almost unable to breathe; I could now only breathe through my nose! I went downstairs and stayed on the settee. Morning came and I asked my wife to call the doctor and ask him to come to the house, it was Friday. He arrived at 5.00pm.  What is it Julian he said in his heavy French accent? I cannot breathe I mouthed. But you have not taken your medicine he said. I cant I replied in a strangled whisper, I cant swallow anything. It is a virus; it will pass, try and take the medicine and left the house. My wife, taking the side of the doctor was getting annoyed with me and said you have to take your medicine. Everything was against me, no one would listen and no one was doing anything to help. I stayed downstairs where I was less trouble, my fever had increased so much that I had to drag a chair outside where I sat for three hours in the middle of the driveway trying to reduce my temperature. Freezing on the outside but boiling on the inside, for the first time I thought I was going to die! Weak and dehydrated I remained on the settee for another full day and night. At 5.00am, I begged my wife to take me to hospital which was twenty-five miles away. She refused so I took the keys and went to start the car; I had to get someone to believe me. She finally agreed and drove me to hospital; we sat in the emergency room.  Eventually a male nurse came to see me. My wife explained the symptoms and he looked down my throat with a torch. An alarm sounded, and he rushed away. Just around the corner we could see someones feet and then heard the sound of a defibrillation machine shocking someones heart. We saw the patients feet jump as the machine sent its life giving shock to the patients heart. Several times we heard the defibrillator and witnessed the jerk of the patients feet. There was no response so the nurses covered the body with a sheet. Almost immediately, another alarm sounded; again the sound of the defibrillator could be heard. My wife said, come on lets go home; they are far too busy for a sore throat. Conceding, I agreed and we drove home.  Monday morning came and I could no longer go on. I told my wife to get me to the doctors as quickly as possible. I must have looked ill because she did not argue.  We asked to see the doctor urgently. We were told that we would have to wait until there was a spare appointment.  Luckily, in France the doctor comes out of his office to greet and collect his patients. Three times he appeared before I collapsed at his feet. I found myself on a stretcher in a side room and was being examined. Patrick asked my wife several questions and then I felt myself being turned over onto my side and a needle being pressed into my buttock. I was later told it was antibiotics. I recovered slightly and Patrick said I was to see a consultant in St Brieuc the following day and he would visit us later that evening to administer another injection. Having not eaten or drank for five days, I longed for a piece of apple. Unable to resist the urge, I cut a small piece and savoured the taste. Out of habit I swallowed. The tiny piece of apple got stuck in my swollen throat and I was choking. I managed to cough up the piece of apple into the bathroom sink and saw blood was pouring from my mouth. Although in a panic, thankfully it stopped bleeding after a few minutes. Later, Patrick arrived and administered another injection. My wife explained the incident with the apple and he said to wait until the consultant investigates further. We headed in to St Brieuc early the following morning. A few minutes after arriving, I was shown into the consulting room and sat in what looked like a dentists chair. The young consultant read the notes that Patrick had given to me and picked up a flexible tube. He spoke English which was a blessing and said he needed to look down my throat. I obligingly opened my mouth and he proceeded to insert the tube up my nostril and I felt it wind its way down into my throat.   he said in his best English! He was looking at a monitor where there was an image of my throat. , he said losing his English totally. I raised my eyes and looked at the screen; it was my throat and was live on TV!  He pointed to a large swelling which had closed up my throat totally. We could see a cut in the swelling and it oozed blood as he manoeuvred the camera around. He said that the swelling was a sac of poison and it had been pierced by the apple skin before healing over. He removed the flexible camera and called to the nurse. She appeared holding a large syringe and what looked like half a pint of clear liquid sealed in a bottle. The nurse inserted a cannula into my hand and the consultant gave me an injection of what he said was antibiotic. It was the largest amount I had ever seen outside of a veterinary surgery.  I was told to attend the clinic at 4.00pm that day for another injection and was to keep the cannula in for the following five days, attending the clinic at 9.00am and 4.00pm every day for further injections. If the swelling closed the throat further, we were to call for an emergency ambulance. My wife asked what had caused the swelling and he said it was the result of a virus known as a quinsy! He said I was lucky that I did not delay any further as quinsys can kill!  He asked several questions regarding my movements over the previous week and my wife explained what had happened at Monsieur Dubois farm which the consultant thought may have been the source of the infection. I attended the arranged appointments and after a week of medication was almost back to normal. What a joy it was to eat and drink again!I was tested for hepatitis as little did Monsieur Dubois know, his fosse septic tank was blocked and overflowing into what was thought was pig slurry; in fact it was human slurry! Luckily, I tested negative and Monsieur Dubois had a new more modern fosse septic installed, all at  of course! Madame and Monsieur Dubois, although affectionately known in the village for trying to kill his English neighbour, remain to this day our best friends!  Julian Race 28/06/2021"
IT WAS NOT MY PLACE,"I had been walking for hours and I did not seem to be getting to my destination. As I went further, I met a crowd. The first face I saw was my musical mother. She came as Whitney. Around her was a throng. It looked like many people had been birthed in our house. I couldnt remember when that happened but I felt like everyone in the crowd was my relative. Then Alas! I met my twin sister. We somehow looked alike!. She was musical. She had everything in talent that our musical mother had. She received all the attention in the room. Her voice was of course the instrument. Everyone in the room praised and talked highly of her. She sang all the high notes and kept everyone entertained. I somehow felt jealous. Why wasnt I given the voice too? I disliked myself for not having the talent. All of sudden, there was darkness all over and high shrills rented the air. Everyone scampered for safety into their rooms. I was not left behind either. I found myself in a dimly lit room with 4 others. The room had 2 double-decked beds. My sister and I shared one upper bed. I didnt understand why we did not sleep in separate beds. It felt like an order. The only problem was, I could not remember when those instructions were given. Everyone had forgotten about the shrills and the darkness in the sitting room that caused us to vacate the area. My sister started singing as we slept. This disrupted my sleep. Somehow, I had started feeling confused. Nothing in this place made any sense. Could it be possible that I had suffered amnesia? Nobody cared about me; at least it seemed. The only time my mother cared was when she told me that I was now an adult and I needed to take care of myself without an ounce of her energy. My sister seemed engulfed in her own world of fame. Everyone else seemed to be busy and asking questions felt like a bother. The people I had lived with and known my entire life had suddenly become strangers. At least not to my face but in my heart, they felt distant. It seemed I was on a self-awareness journey in my adulthood. The most difficult thing for any grown-up. I didnt know anything about my childhood, I could not remember my school, I didnt remember my friends, I didnt know these people in our home except for the bloodline that felt traceable by heart. Did something happen to me? Was I involved in an accident that left me with memory loss? This and many other questions jolted in my mind. Just then, the drama queen was at it again. She loves attention and she can do anything for it. Even when we were little, It was always about her. I realized I could remember that bit of my sister while we were maturing. Excitement beamed on my face for this little piece of memory. It felt like gold. But it was short-lived when the door flew ajar and there stood my mother wearing an angry face. A very familiar face when my sister had been wronged. I knew I was in trouble. My sister started her accusations about me trying to push her from the bed. I slapped her mouth for such rantings. Off she left the room and everyone ran after her. The scene had transferred to the compound of the house. It was night but all in the house woke up to beg her to come inside. Sweets, parts on the back, kind words, and lullabies were sung as part of the appeal for the queen of the home to get back to the house. This felt unusual too. While outside, It became clear that my sister was a favorite of everyone and she was treated like some kind of a god. And now, I had messed things up by angering their idol. They made me feel terrible about it. Nobody wanted to see me there. Suddenly an order thundered from my mother for everyone to start heading to the house. Obedience was a priority as every foot hurried not to be the last one to enter. I lingered behind for a while because I was afraid of what awaited me in that house. Nothing seemed constant here. It was a rollercoaster of emotions caused by incidents that I didnt understand their significance. I felt like my head would burst if I followed this crowd inside. In addition, I had enraged them by slapping their most precious member of the family. As I hesitated behind, My mother walked towards me and did an odd thing. She started begging me to go to the house with her. She was all of a sudden friendly. I really wanted to believe that she was genuine but my intuition communicated otherwise. It was too late, I had made up my mind. I didnt want this place anymore. It felt strange and unsafe. The more my mother begged, the more I started retreating. She started running. I started running too. I had been running for long in a deserted wild land. No crop, no sign of anyone except the dust. The road seemed long and that brought tiredness to my entire body. My muscles were aching and I could feel them chew on my bones. I was sweaty, thirsted hard, and gasped for air. I started passing out, passing out.. And I went. Down with a thud. I woke up on a top bed. Two sisters were beside me accusing me of stealing their dreams. I was more perplexed by this. From one unknown land, I landed in another peculiar place. They were mad at me and each was ready to give me a beating. As they quarreled at me and threatened to lay blows on me, I covered my head and my ears with both of my hands, and voila! I saw light in my room. A new dawn had been ushered. That is when it became clear that I saw the dead, but it was not my place. Excited that I was alive and normal, I got out of the bed, opened my balcony door, settled on the chair that always rests there, and started enjoying the sunrise of a beautiful day."
The Reunion,"Standing on the porch he could see the waves. It was the mountain that spoke. I was wondering when you would appear, LT said. Standing behind him was EP, grinning viciously. It was only a matter of time. Youre late. Coughing, LT slowly wiped his hands on his legs. You know that team tag was terrible. Perhaps find another one? 	Silence came after, with only a smirk coming from EPs face. Nah, it seems that combo was more than enough, though you shall see soon. Shaking his head, LT walks away, moving closer to the shells that laid out before him. How long will the cycle go? Arent the teams supposed to already have their matchups? Maybe, came a voice from above. 	Without hesitation both LT and EP dashed to their lefts, sensing the aura that floated. You know, LT remarked, I always figured you were in the wait. Maybe its time to put it down. 	Placed before them was a dark figure, the shoulders wearing pads of steel. To be fair you agreed. Why back out now? Cause you suck Ep replied, though Lt was just shaking his head furiously. Inching closer, he noticed the gleam that came from his pocket. You brought it, eh? Lt stated. Glaring, the figure merely shrugged its shoulders and launched forward to EP. 	Show me. Before EP could react, the figure thrusted its dagger into his shoulder. You see, the figure grumbled, You wanted to work with me. And then you decided that you wanted to chill. Pitiful, you are one with the darkness. Why let the light come through? 	Grimacing, EP yanked the dagger out, flipping it to the side. I said I became one with the darkness. Not one with evil. Which by the way, Lil T99 remarked, is a difference. We are a soldiers soul, but what you have become is somethingdifferent I suppose. 	I see. So, honesty is what kills you. We agreed to be TreytheTerrible, and so far, it has been wonderful. Besides, I have not committed no wrong. What possibly are you afraid of? With his left hand, he jams EP in the chest and zooms to LT. Swinging to the left, LT pulled the key blade and blocked the attack. Terrible as in truth, not terrible as in evil. When will this day end, then? What you do you seek? 	It came to a standstill. The wind stopped blowing, though the ground trembled with rage. Ep was curled, bandaging his wound. 	Damn you Ep, in your attempt to become one with darkness you created TreytheTerrible. Good job bro. Lt stated. Screw you, perhaps you should have taken yourself more seriously then. Ep replied. 	In the end it does not matter. As you said LT, truth is what matters, right? Have I not been following that? 	Grunting, LT pushed TTT to the edge of the beach. I dont trust your intentions; the coldness that Ep created was meant to suppress emotions, not to become one with it. Whatever youre planning it goes against what Im here for. he responded. 	TTT stood there for a sec, then howled a laughter, not one of joy but one of agony, one that seeps into ones soul. Baka, I dont care for any of that. I am simply here. I exist. So do you. You created me out of pain, and now I am here to ensure you win. Do not test me. Gods angel or not, my wrath is also a thousand-fold. We are one and the same, are we not?  	Well, in any case, if we are on the same team who cares? As long as we got the vibes its cool. Approaching them was TD, a playful grin that was bound to snipe back. You all are interrupting my sleep, and we ought to do more playing chuckling, Lt picks up his card that fell on the floor. Meditation is all that we need. TTT, we shall speak again soon. Do as you please but know Ill destroy you within seconds if you dare become a threat. 	Then the night cleared, though the clouds still roamed stormily. TTT only glared, but with a glint of something mysterious. You keep forgetting we have the same goals, simply different methods. Relax and allow me to do my part. I will soon discover the Astro projection, and we shall see then what lies within.	The alarm clock came on, and Lt laid there, wondering what the dream was about. In any case, the school was counting on the swim team to make it, so he had no choice but to head over to the bus stop. When the day ends, it all comes down. LT wondered what mysteries lied within the Astro projection; answers beyond the page could be found and then used to further ones own enlightenment. When the day ends, it is what it is. 	Stepping outside the door, Lt sneaked a peek, noticing something strange. If the alarm went off, though the dream was lucid, does that mean the time that passed never occurred? Marching back to his bathroom, Lt noticed that the toothpaste was still there from the night before, though he could have sworn that he put it up before he went to sleep. Then perhaps EP was right then; If TTT was on an agenda of his own, then it would be no surprise if he somehow launched something from now to then. 	Though as the time kept ticking, LT knew that could not be the case. The only thing then would be to sit around and wait for the day to end; the loop that never passes the line but will always come to full circle, what could it even mean at this point? Grabbing the doorknob, Lt snaps it around, hoping for some sort of release. Only then could he see it; the crack that entered dimensions was never to be opened, but at this exact same moment only then did he come to realize.The portal could never end, meaning the day would never end. It was forever a time loop that would pass onto eons. Likewise, it is what it is."
First time to Cafe Shi,"Magical bookstores? It was not what I had been looking for so long ago. I had been yelled at by a professor and humiliated, however I proved I was right.I had had enough. I was walking the streets going to a pharmacy that had a malt shop inside it. Yes, Bozeman Montana still had a malt shop and for five dollars the whole canister along with large malt glass would be mine.However, it was sunset and right where an alley should lead me to the other side of a street a building appeared. Appeared? Well, I knew my location. I knew where I was going.And the building was not here last week so I would say just appeared. In the sunset.The shop was called Portal to Magical books or something like that. Now bookshops in Bozeman are rare. Three of them specific and to have one appear in the alleyway. Well, I had to see what was inside. I entered and the most stunning collection of books I have seen was there.What makes me a person who knows books? I got lost in the White House once and ended up in their downstairs basement. From there I followed some people into the library of congress and that story is even weirder than this one.So I knew books. And the collection was wild. Personalized first editions and handwritten books of all shapes and sizes.Maps of worlds not just a world but worlds and histories told about other times and places.In the middle of all of this was a person seated behind a table and evidently signing his books.. However, all I could do was to look. He looked rather famous. Something or someone I should know. But I could not place him.His book? Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance? Never heard of it. However, it dawned on me where I had seen this person before.A long time ago in one of my mother's college courses she took to maintain her teachers certificate. Yes, I got dragged along to some rather unusual places. He was there discussing with someone in a rather loud voice about..About what? I dont recall. But I recall what I was told when I was told after that lecture. Quality is not as important as doing. For quality will determine whether people like it or not. But 85 percent of reality is in the doing not just quality.Who said that? For some reason, the voice did not seem familiar, and I just gawked.Anyway, the person got up told someone for I could not see anyone that he was off to eat.And I followed him. Why? Well, I wondered where would a famous author would eat in Bozeman, Montana?And?That at sunset the orange-ish light lighted a building aside the bookstore. The sign Cafe Shi.And that is how I entered Cafe Shi for the first time. And did I eat with the famous author?Well, yes and no. The lady who asked how I got there was kind. However, I could swear she looked like a dragon for a moment and then a stylish Chinese lady accepted my answer I was hungry.For I was hungry.She seated me around a table with several other people. And that is where I was introduced to Ender. He was dressed like he was going or coming from a Halloween party. He looked sort of like the pirate on the rum bottle and he spoke about the most interesting tales I have ever heard.And I? I matched him tale for tale. He would tell a story about how the worlds changed and that South America used to be under North America and that treasure here was un findable there because of the great deepest of the ocean.And I? I would tell him a tale of Butch Cassidy living in Nevada bootlegging rum in the 1920s. We had a lovely time until I noticed we were the only ones left.He told me stories of worlds where Mongolia was ruled by China. And I told him stories about how Custer had died not in the battle of the little Big Horn.He told me stories of realities where time was sped up to a point that reality was stretched and people lived 1,000 years in one of our years.And I told him stories of the train ride in Serbia and Czars, two daughters that escaped execution.He told me pirate tales and of adventures with some person named Richard Burton.And I told him tales of authors I had known as a child.He told me stories of heaven and hell.And I told him tales of long ago people that very few people knew.Now between these tales we drank. Ender introduced me to rum. And I ate sweet not sweat and sour shrimp. Beyond that? The hostess was not of this world. Meaning? Like I said she reminded me of a dragon and to see her dance between tables and serve was like watching a waltz. It was lovely. For a time I think I just watched her stylish movements between me, Ender, the author who was talking to some lady about if I recall some vampires? Anyway it was a grand time.I looked around after eating God knows what and paid the total bill because it was one of those occasions you wanted to last longer. We walked out together at sunrise and I turned to say good bye. The place. The bookstore and everything was as it was before an alley way right behind the pharmacy.I looked for anything to see if I was dreaming or not, and the only thing I had was two business cards. I did not even have the receipt for the meal I had just eaten.The two business cards? One said see you next time Magical books R US. And the other Cafe Shi a place to dream and eat.. Did I ever go back there to see it again?Of course. Was it ever there? No. However, I did find them elsewhere."
Road Trip,"Ok...so Jonny the turtle, Harry the poodle, and Claire the hedgehog were on a road trip. They were in Jonny's Leaf 2020 with hatchback seating perfect for Claire to snuggle into. The Leaf 2020 didn't go particularly fast, which was ideal for Jonny - he didn't like fast very much. Now, you may ask, ""Where do a turtle, a poodle, and a hedgehog like to go in their spare time?"", great question! But where do they get the money for a Leaf 2020, where do they even buy a Leaf 2020, and how did a turtle, poodle, and hedgehog become friends? See these are silly questions, they don't need to be answered because a turtle, a poodle, and a hedgehog are somehow riding in a vehicle and that's enough to make an interesting story...right? The turtle was driving ever so slowly, as he often did, but Claire was becoming very impatient.Can I drive? she asked, accidentally puffing up her spikes from sheer excitement and pricking Harry.Ow, Clumsy Claire! No, you never get to drive. Only Jonny can drive the Leaf irritated and sore, Harry replied and batted Claires quills away.Sorry Claire... I drive and I dont like it fast. Jonny slowly said his words to Claire as if he was reading them off of a newspaper with a magnifying glass.Claire continued to get antsy and could not sit still. First, she shoved her butt to the right, then to the left; she even tried laying on her side. This was common for Claire but today it was too much for Harry.Listen Claire, you need to lay still! Harry shouted into Claires quills that puffed up at his boisterous voice.I cannot help it, it is in my nature Claire casually replied, tilting her sun hat.Claire tried to contain herself in the back of the Leaf but the thought of driving kept making her feet kick. She closed her eyes and tried to visualize the car going very fast down the road. The leaves and berries would be going so fast passing the Leaf. She saw grubs and worms floating in front of her eyes. They were so yummy-looking as they rained down on her. Claire opened her mouth and caught the worms and the grubs, chomped on them and licked her face to keep the scent and taste for later. The Leaf was shaking and going faster, more worms and grubs were falling into Claires mouth. She couldnt keep up with them all, some were landing on her face and belly and onto the road around her. She had her tongue out, slapping at the bugs and licking as much off of her furry belly; very furry and thick. Claire was licking away, the Leaf was shaking about, and Harry was slapping at Claire and yelling.Stop licking me, you hog! Harrys shouts finally awoke Claire from the most surreal dream she had ever had. She had dog hair in her mouth and no bugs or worms. She tried using her tongue to push the dog hair out of her mouth, Harry kept yelling, and Jonny just kept smiling and driving. You see, Jonny had just had a vision too and he now knew where they were all going to go today - The Chocolate Castle.The Chocolate Castle was built in a land so old that it predates time, at least thats what they say. The mountains are the tallest around and have the founders of Creature Cavern etched into the side of them. Creature Cavern was more than just a cavern, it included Chocolate Castle, The Land of Ol, and Hometown. Ironically, Hometown is a large area where everybody lives, except the founders, and thus is home to all.The highway through the tall, grassy marsh was long and slow, even for Jonny. He broke from his daydreaming and pulled the Leaf over onto a pebble road. He parked and gave Harry and Claire a chance to get out and stretch their legs. As Harry chased his tail and Claire pushed her snout through the thick grass, Jonny sat and soaked up the sun. He thought he wanted to get out and move around too, but the sun felt good on his shell. Minutes passed and the marsh became quiet; Johnny envisioned the triple chocolate leaves that they sold at the castle. He yearned to be there already. He opened his eyes and found Harry and Claire staring at him.What is it? Jonny questioned, blinking slowly and constantly to get the dirt out of his eyelids.The grass is waving about and Harry thinks it is a weasel. Claire declared in a rather timid voice, even for her.I didnt say weasel, you said that! Harry panted and contested Claire. His voice was low too and he was very close when talking to Jonny.Okay, then we leave Jonny advised them and began to reach for the keys in the ignition.No! Harry and Claire whispered with urgency and tugged Jonny away from the steering wheel.It will hear us Claire whispered, almost into Jonnys ear. Claire explained how Harry had just seen the grass shuffle again. They were sure that the creature was nearby.Harry hid behind Jonnys shell for protection. He remembered stories Grandpuppa would tell him about attacks from weasels while in the bush back in the day. He imagined weasels were large, ferocious beasts with the ability to kill any animal. His Grandpuppa told him that it was a miracle he survived the battles; so they must be tough and dangerous. This is the only knowledge of weasels that was known to the trio.They sat in the Leaf 2020 and were all bunched up together in the front now. Both Claire and Harry were curled up trying to hide behind Jonny. Claire didnt have any real reason to be scared of weasels, yet she hid and was just as scared as Harry (). Harry wished he had his bone. At least he would have something to bite down on, instead of his tongue, which is what he accidentally did with the state of fear he was in. Harry whined with his bit tongue, Claire hissed and tried to not raise her quills enough to poke Harry again, and Jonny listened. He listened to the grass rustling and moving. It sounded like something large enough to scare almost any creature he knew. As per usual for Jonny, he was more intrigued than frightened. He listened intently and peered into the grass as his friends peered at their closed eyelids. As the sound from the tall grass came closer and got louder, Jonny felt his friends trembling behind him.He shouted, Hey! Whos in there?He tightened his skin and stretched his neck to look taller. In a moment, a dark shadow appeared at the edge of the grass. A paw poked out of the grass and it was surprisingly small for a weasel. Johnnys fears waned and he said more pleasantly, Hello there.Harry and Claire glanced out and saw now that they were very misled. On the hood of the Leaf 2020, was a small barn mouse wiggling its whiskers and sniffing the air.Im so sorry if I frightened anyone. I tend to make a lot of noise when Im in the tall grass to frighten away any bigger, hungry creatures. I saw that all you werent a threat and that I had scared you. I am sorry. The mouse continued to sniff the ground and the nearby grass.What are you looking for, mouse? Harry asked somewhat rudely.My name is Cleo and I am looking for some fruit, she started to scurry to the back of the car and sniffed her way to the grass again.Wait! Jonny quickly called out, surprising to everyone. We are heading to the Chocolate Castle. They have fresh fruit and choco-covered cherries. Im going to get some triple choco-leaves. Would you like to come?Jonnys exclamation certainly thrilled Cleo as she leaped into the air, cheering and climbed into the Leaf 2020.Wow, now I can get a choco-bone meal, Harry barked and started to slobber out the window.Yes sir, and I will gladly grab some strawberry worm surprise! Claire chomped and started to lick her fur looking for the grubs from earlier.Jonny pulled the convertible Leaf 2020 out onto the highway again, now with one more partner in the front with him and Harry. They were all smiling and thinking of one thing - The Chocolate Castle."
One Last Summer!!!,"Like every other cities, Coimbatore was also busy at 8 o clock in the morning. Ishitha, a 10 year old is waking up as she has to reach her school by 9.30 a.m. She is an enthusiastic child with lots of Why questions. Every time she goes through something new, her mind pops up with Why. To answer to her question is like winning a Quiz Competition. She sat upright in bed unable to open her eyes. Her mother Preethi called from kitchen for 15th time in the row. Now that Ishitha had got up, she went into the bathroom to get freshen up. When she came out her regular milk was waiting for her in the dining table. She drank it and went to get ready. After bathing, she is now in navy blue pinafore with white shirt inside and her hair neatly brushed. Something striked her mind and she is now searching her grandma. Ishitha shouted, Ma, where is grandma?. Her mother replied, She is on the balcony. On hearing this, Ishitha rushed to the balcony. Her grandma, a 75 years old woman was wearing a red saree with black designs on it. She was watering the plants and when she saw Ishitha running, she asked Why are you rushing chotu?. Ishitha said, You promised me that you and I will be seeing old photos together today evening GiGi, so I came to remind you. Dont forget!. She said and rushed back to get ready without waiting for a reply. Her GiGi smiled looking at her cute little granddaughter who is always excited to spend as much as her time with her GiGi.When Ishitha came back from school in the evening, to her surprise so many photo albums was kept at the table as promised by her GiGi. Ishitha totally forgot about this because of so many troubles that happened in school. But this one lit her mood with happiness. She suddenly went and hugged her GiGi. She was asked to freshen up and to eat her evening snacks and then they will see this together. As asked by her GiGi, she did all those things and now they are ready to see the album. The albums have so many photos like the one where Ishitha celebrates her 1st birthday, the one where her family moves into this new house, the one with all the school dances, the one with their trips together and so on.They now have seen most of the pictures and the stories were told to Ishitha whenever she asked her questions and when she asked her grandma and her mother what happened there. When Ishitha took another album a single photo from that album slipped and fell down. She bent down and took it and she couldnt recognize when was it taken or whom were in the photo or where was it taken. None of it was familiar to her. So she showed her GiGi the picture and asked her, Who are all these GiGi?. The moment the photo caught her grandma, she wasnt able to speak or react. Her eyes was glued to that picture. A drop of tear escaped from the corner of her eyes. On seeing this, Ishitha thought she did something wrong and she apologised to her grandma. Her grandma told, No Chotu you didnt have to ask sorry because you didnt do any wrong. This is me and my friends so many years back. This picture was taken on the last day of our school and that memories came rush back to me when I saw this. I thought this photo was lost. I searched for this photo so many times but I couldnt find it anywhere. But today seeing all this faces after long time makes me want to go back to my school days chotu. She pointed out the girl wearing yellow colour salwar and said, You see Chotu, this is me during my school days. And named others in the photo one after the other.On hearing this, Ishitha wanted to hear that entire story of that day and their friendship.Her grandmas thoughts flooded back to her school days. She told, Chotu, our gang had seven members. We werent the studies gang or the rowdy gang or the innocent gang. We were the mixture of all. No one could ever match us  that was our thought when we were in school. We will violate all the rules of school, we would get scolding from our class teacher daily, we will study when needed, and we will always be in canteen whenever there is a break. The thing is we will be together all the time and do everything together. We have seen each others every version. We have laughed together till our stomach hurts, cried together, have scolded each other, been with each other in their toughest times, fought with each other and still we were together till the end.When her GiGi completed her sentence and looked at Ishitha, she was so much interested and excited to hear it. So her grandma continued, The day you saw in that photo was taken on our farewell Chotu. Our school doesnt allow any batch to have farewell but we consider ourselves the luckiest batch because we got to do that. The idea of farewell itself excited every one of us. We planned so many things like dress to wear, ornaments and slippers matching them and the things we are going to do the entire day. So many songs were planned and so many dance steps were rehearsed. And then she continued after taking a long breath, The day finally came. We all came early as we planned and started decorating the auditorium. The auditorium was full of balloons and papers and stickers and more importantly, laughter. As ours is a Christians school, we always start the day with prayer and our farewell day also started with a Meditation. We suddenly had a thought in mind that this prayer is going to be our last one and that one hit us hard. We have been studying in the same school chotu for nearly 14 years and each day for the past 14 years started and ended with prayer, this one going to be our last one started to make that day a difficult one. Then there was the speech of sister, teachers. Then there was this unexpected event that turned the happy day into a sad one. Our journey  this is a video created by our juniors with all the photos we took in school, personally and everything including our achievements. Seeing that photos and recognising that we wont be seeing each other hereafter daily, that we are going to enter a new world and these faces will not be a part of it, that the innocence part of life is over, that there is no such school uniforms, no school shoes, that we wont be plaiting our hair anymore with ribbons, that there will not be any school bags that probably weigh more than us, that we will not return to this building anytime soon and even if we return we will not be students here anymore wasnt that easy to digest Chotu. We always wanted to end the farewell with a smile on our faces but instead each and every one of us was crying. We dont know when we started to cry, when we started to feel a heavy heart instead of a happy one but that thoughts was like a ball of fire melting all our hearts. We cried and cried and cried with hugging each other. We took several photos to keep it as our memories, we went to dinner together and that day ended with both happy and sad but that memories are still fresh and they cannot be forgotten ever.When her GiGi completed the story, Ishitha with tears blocking her eyes came and hugged her grandma and said, You are lucky GiGi. You got such beautiful friends. Where are they now GiGi? I havent met them till now.. Her grandma replied with a smily lips and teary eyes, I hope they are somewhere telling their grandchildren this story as I am telling to you."
A Fun/ Crazy Road Trip,"Twins Campbell and Sarah were upstairs in their room packing the final things for their summer road trip. Campbell was finishing up her backpack packing. She shoved her book, ipad, airpods, and sweatshirt into the bag and then zipped it up. Sarah was finishing up packing her backpack as well. She put her book, chewing gum, make-up pouch, and her airpods into her back before zipping it up.	Campbell, Sarah come on, it's time to go. Their mom called.	Coming! Campbell called back.	Both girls grabbed their backpacks and their cellphones and ran down the stairs and outside to the car. Their dad had just finished putting the bags in the trunk of their white Lexis.	Come on girls in the car Their dad said.	Campbell and Sarah climbed into the backseat of the car. Their mom got into the passenger seat and their dad in the driver's seat. Then they buckled up and drove off away from their house. As soon as they drove off their mom turned on some music in the front seat and started singing along. Campbell groaned.	Mom please dont sing that song. She said.	Oh come on honey. Her mom said.	Where are we stopping first? Sarah asked.	Well, I hope you two packed your bathing suits because were stopping at the Slither Slide water park! Her dad exclaimed.	OMG really! Campbell asked.	Yes really. Her dad said.	The twins loved the water park because it was so fun. T had a lot of really tall water slides. The last time the twins had been was when they were 6 and because of their age they werent tall enough to ride most of the slides. It had still been a lot of fun but now that they were 13 they had been begging to go back because they were both tall enough to go down all the slides including the tallest one which was so cool because it was a tube but it was clear so they could see all the way down to the bottom. Both girls squealed in excitement as they started planning out what slides they were going to do.	I want to do the tube first Sarah said.	Fine but then I get to do the Slither slide first. Campbell replied.	Deal. Sarah said	Then Sarah pulled out her phone and opened it to the camera.	Selfie! She said. Smile.	Both girls smiled for the camera.	Send that to me please. Campbell said.	Sure. Sarah replied.	Girls were almost there so put away your phones please. Their mom said.	Ok. Sarah said. She shoved her phone back into her bag.	They pulled up to the Slither Slide Water Park.	Alright girls Im going to get out your suitcases so that you can get your swimsuits. Then you can go to the bathrooms and change, okay? Their dad said	Okay dad. Campbell said.	When they pulled up to the water park their dad opened the trunk and the two girls got out their swimsuits. Then as he was trying to close it one of the bags slid out of the truck and hit the ground. All the contents spilled onto the ground. The family picked them up. Then while their dad went to park the car the girls went with their mom to the bathrooms where they changed into their swimsuits. Then they met their dad outside and while their dad went to get the towels and their mom found a place to sit the two girls ran as fast as they could to the water slides. As they had arranged in the car Sarah went to the Tube Slide first while Campbell went to the Slither Slide first. The two girls and their two parents spent almost all day at the water park. They had a lovely lunch and when it was time to go both girls were sad.	Do we have to go? Campbell asked.	Well, do you want to come back tomorrow? her dad asked.	Yes! Campbell exclaimed.	Good because were staying at the Slither Hotel!! Her dad exclaimed.	Really!! Sarah asked.	Yes! Her dad said.	Yay! Thank you thank you thank you!	You're welcome! Now come on girls lets go get our stuff from the car.	The family went to the car. When they got to their car they found that it wasnt there. They went to the attendant at the lot and asked about their car. The lady said	It got towed. Here is the number to call.	Their dad called the tow place and they had to get an uber and go to the place to get their car. Then they hit traffic and Campbell got impatient. She started bouncing up and down and ended up hitting her head on the top of the car. Finally they got to the tow place and found their car. They thought they were finally ready to go but then the worker told us the price to get it out of the tow place. Then Campbell, Sarah, and their mom had to listen to their dad and that worker argue and argue. Finally their dad still had to pay the same price because the worker threatened to not give us our car back. Apparently he could do that. When they got back to the Water Park they got their suitcases from the trunk. Campbell and Sarah also got their backpacks. They went into the hotel and because Campbell and Sarah had been playing so hard they were wiped and went to bed soon after. When they got up in the morning they had breakfast and then they went to the water park again for a little while. After that they had lunch and then they left the Slither Slide Water Park.	Back in the car they listened to music and talked. Campbell and Sarah texted their friends pictures from the Water Park and played games on their phones. They also watched a movie. The family stopped for dinner at a burger joint and had burgers and ice cream. Then they drove to their hotel. The hotel was called the Silverton. The girls had their own room because they had a suit. They stayed up late talking and finally went to bed at around midnight.	The next morning back on the road they hit a lot of traffic. Their dog Minnie started biting Sarahs hair. Oh did I forget to mention that the family had a dog? Anyways their dog wasnt allowed at the Water Park or in the hotel so they kind of had to sneak her in. Now back to the car Minnie started biting Sarahs hair. Sarah tried to push Minnie off and in the process of bringing her hand back she smacked Campbell in the face. Then their mom leaned back to scold them and the traffic suddenly started moving. The car jolted, sending their moms face crashing into the seat. The phone rang so everyone had to be quiet as their dad answered. When he hung up he said	We have to turn around and go home. Apparently while we were gone the oven started a small fire. The neighbors put it out but they just called and said that we needed to come home because the smoke alarm malfunctioned. Now who left the oven on?	Campbell, Sarah, and their mom stared slack jawed at their dad. Then Campbell cheared. Everyone stared at her.	What? This was fun but now we can go home. Campbell said.	So the family turned around and headed back home."
Night Sun,"Andy rolled over, pulling the light quilt along with him, then yanking it over his head like a monks cowl.The room was filled with dazzling lemony sunlight though it was only seven or so in the morning.And Saturday! thoughtknowHe peeked an eye out from his blankey-cave and turned curiously back towards the window.As usual, the cheery cacophony of bird voices wafted in through the east facing window.He recognized just about all of them, a hobby of his: the sweet peeping of house wrens, the singsong warbling of colorful goldfinches and the repetitive trilling of magpies.The entire symphony of birds didnt disturb his rest in the least, even the obnoxious jay's raspy,  that punctuated the melodies like an out of tune tuba.He found the morning birdsong to be as meditative as the nights, though the night had the added bonus of crickets and his favorite, owls.The sleep stealing culprit was Ralph, his dog.Hed pulled the entire right side of the curtain aside and was staring out into the yard.Ralph was a scruffy Jack Russell terrier with a mind of his own and a personality as delightful as a basket of baby chicks.Andys mom said he must be part cat, because he was master of .Oh Ralphie, not again, moaned Andy. Its too early.And Saturday.Lemme sleep some more.Ralph was a statue except for one brief ear flicker.Know you hear me, Andy said as he turned all the way over to observe his dog.Youre so weird. He mumbled.Great.Now I gotta pee.The ten-year-old boy grabbed a hoodie from the bedpost and sleepily sluffed into it.It was two weeks from summer vacation and would be hot out by 9am, but at seven, it was chilly.He pushed his feet into his plush red  slippers and headed for the door.You comin?You wanna go out?The small white and brown dog at last tore his gaze from the window and turned his deep chocolate eyes to his boy.As usual he was grinning, and Andys annoyance melted away like butter in a hot iron skillet.Ralph cocked his head the way Jack Russells do, just like the one in that old RCA ad with the phonograph.Andy knew the logo art was called, His Masters Voice because he collected memorabilia and stuff regarding that particular breed of dog.The choice of dog breed had been his. After careful consideration, much googling and wikapedia-ing, Andy decided the smarter the dog the better.He knew a smart dog would catch on to training and tricks faster than a dumber breed.The size, about 18 pounds when full grown, was perfect too, he could take Ralph just about anywhere.Added bonus- not only was Ralph allowed to sleep on Andys bed, he did not hog it either.Maybe a dumber dog would have been better. He teased Ralph, A big goofy Irish Setter or something.Ralph cocked his head the other way as if trying to figure out what his boy was saying.Cmon Ralph.The pup knew what  meant and decided it was his window of opportunity to go outside and pee.After letting Ralph out the back door, Andy went back down the hall to use the bathroom.When he was done, he knew he was up for good.He returned to his room and grabbed yesterdays cargo shorts off the floor.They had some grass stains- he and his chums had played during their lunch break- but he didnt care.He put on a fresh tee-shirt though, relishing the cleanly scented cotton and the softness of many washes.Mom had left a note on the kitchen table,  complete with her signature smiley-face.He stuffed the ten in his pocket and did the math automatically- 3.50 for oj, 3.00 for milkhed have 3.50 left for himself.That was always the deal., he thought.I can get a new deck of cards.Hed been practicing cards tricks for a month and his old deck had too many bent corners and was missing one of the jacks.Cmon Ralph, goin to the storehe kept his voice down.Mom had worked a double the night before and relished a good sleep as much as he did.It had been a good day.Full of fresh air and bicycle races with Richie and Sam, his two best friends.Bird watching in the woods behind their house, Andy enjoyed pointing out various breeds and calls.The grassy, woodsy scent of summer a constant reminder that school would be out soon.A lot of kids in Andys grade were gamers.Even if Andys mom could afford a game console  the cool kind- he pretty much thought all video games were a humongous waste of time.Besides, all the gamers had pasty skin, often decorated with premature pimples, and pale doughy bodies.He figured in about a hundred years, gamers would be a whole different genus of human being.They didnt even speak the same language.Hitting softballs and playing cowboys, his bike his horse and Ralph as his fearless sidekick, was more his style.Playing spacemen was another favorite.That night, Mom set up the tv trays in the living room.Every Saturday night they watched Svenghoulie together while eating hungry man dinners.Thered be pudding or jello for dessert too, with cool whip!The old-timey movies were awesome, usually black and white, and always creepy.The narrator, Svenghoulie, was hysterical!Mom said, Oh!I remember this one!Actually saw it in a drive-in. Tonights movie was , and as usual she added, You sure this wont give you nightmares?No Mom, Im cool.He said, eyes glued to the outdated tv set, Ralph will protect me.Two hours later they said goodnight, did their nighttime bathroom rituals, and went to their rooms.Andy left the window open but closed the curtains snugly.Mom and son went to church on Sundays, but service wasnt until 10am.They'd agreed to sleep in until 9, skip breakfast, and eat a big lunch afterwards.Maybe even a picnic by the shady pond in the woods.At 7am shards of brilliant sunlight battered Andys eyelids, his inside view was bright orangey-red.The Blob in his dream vanished like the Cheshire Cat, the last part of the hungry creature to faint into invisibility was a mouthful of sharks teeth.(In Andys nightmares, all the monsters had sharks teeth, stained crimson and dripping with stringy saliva.)Ral-phieeeeeeeseriously? He whined to the dog, who once again was sitting in the window, the sunlight streaming around him like the bright ethereal luminescence of Gods robes.Ralph sat still as a grave marker, staring out into the woods.Ugh.Grunted Andy as he rolled over, putting the warmth to his back.Andy sat at the kitchen table while his mom finished up loading the picnic basket- tuna sandwiches, potato chips for him, Smart Food popcorn for her, sliced apples, with caramel sauce for dipping.Ralphs been super weird lately.Wierder than normal? She asked.Well, yeah.He does this thing where he opens the curtain and stares out the window, Andy said, then added, Hes done it for over a week now.He just sits there, looking at the forest, doesnt move at all when I call himThat Selective Deafness Cat Syndrome, eh? she said, not suppressing a grin.Andy didnt smile back.Her grin faltered, then withered all together.Andy said, And, its  seven every time.Its totally creeping me out...His voice wavered as he looked down at the hands wringing in his lap.His mom came over then, concerned more for Andy than the dog. Would you feel better if we took him to see the vet?Mom, we cant afford that.Besides the vet wont find anything physically wrong. Andy sighed, Maybe an exorcistThis time his mother had a hard time suppressing a laugh, she had to bite her cheeks.She let out a gush of relief when Andy tittered a bit himself.How about the next time he does his weird window- staring thing you come get me? I wanna see this thing for myself.Then well take it from there.Its probably just a phaseor a cat-thing.Theyve been known to freak people out by staring at closets and whatnot.That night, Andy again closed the curtains.He thought about safety-pinning them shut but decided that he really wanted Mom to see the odd, creepy behavior.The boy was rudely awoken by bright light pounding on his eyelids like a madman axing a door.His eyes felt puffy.He felt unnaturally weary., he thought.Something was not right.The room simmered with .The curtain was open, the bright light dazzling.But for the first time in a week, Ralph was not sitting there.Andy glanced at the vintage, black-faced Westclox on his nightstand, knowing it was 7am again.It was am!He sat bolt upright as if yanked up on puppet strings.His heart hammered like a ten-foot hummingbird.His flesh prickled, just like his shins had prickled when he had accidentally run through a patch of stinging nettles in the forest.The light suddenly winked out, leaving spots in his vision.Im dreaming, thats all.Just a crazy dream.Andy reached down to the foot of the bed in the inky darkness.Ralph was not there.The bedroom door was still closed.The panicking boy leapt out of bed and stumbled over a sneaker, nearly braining himself on the windowsill.He caught himself and leaned out on shakey arms as far as he could. couldWith mounting alarm, he realized there were no night sounds.The air was a dead lead curtain- no crickets, no whip-or-wills, no tree frogs- just nothing.He screamed then, MOM!!!MOOOOOOOM!!!Andy slumped at the kitchen table.It was four in the morning.His small hands cradled a cup of warm milk.Through his nostrils, he sucked in great gobs of snot.As soon as its light out- only an hour and a half- we go look for Ralph, ok?Andy only nodded.She had talked him out of going into the woods in the dark but had allowed him to search the small property with a flashlight.While her son searched outside, she had gotten into jeans, a sweatshirt, and her grubby old Vans. She braced herself for the dreadful cry of anguish, Ralphs mutilated body discovered.She flashed back to nine years earlier.Shed had a dog.She never spoke of him, no point really.Andy had been only one when Bernie died and had no memory of the kind and gentle beagle mix.The dog had been Josephs, but it was clear from the start, the sad-eyed pup was hers.Joseph was NOT a good man.Dogs know instantly, people can take decades.The blood in her urine was the last straw.He beat her, he beat the dog.What would he do to their baby son?She had packed up her little Toyota with necessities, that included Bernie.Shed found this small but cozy, clean home reasonably offered for rent.The tidy lot was a half-acre, with town just two miles away, and lush green woods edging the back of the property. Just the place a boy would be stoked to grow up in.When Andy was just past his first birthday, Bernie got himself killed.The old kitchen door had had a doggie flap in it, Bernie came and went as he pleased.He never wandered too far.Marie-Claire had scolded him a few times at first, and he seemed content to rule the yard. Hed been about eleven and had not lost even an ounce of puppy essence, the one where every butterfly chase was the first.One night a screeching, hissing sound woke her.The sound like a storage unit filled with Tasmanian devils!Then shed heard Bernies frantic barks.Barks so unlike his normal beagle ululating.Shed never forget the scream.She had had to find Bernie, though she had known he was gone.The tiniest flame of hope had flickered on, like a miniature lantern held by an elf.She had found the body, ragged and bloody, gutted by sharp feral claws. The loss was a permanent hole punched in her heart.On this terrible night, she empathized with her young son. But his wail of despair never came.At the first light, Marie-Claire and Andy crossed the yard and tromped through the woods, sticking to the deer paths that wove through the dense vegetation like an enormous spiders web.Each went a mile in different directions until all the forested land was covered.At 10am theyd tiredly given up.At noon, Andy rode his bike into town.He peddled fast to keep his eyes dry, choking on sobs when he looked down- no spunky little sidekick, no best friend keeping pace.He posted flyers all around town.Solicitation ads were strictly forbidden, even fined, but lost pet flyers were allowed, neighbors commiserated together.The sad boy asked any and all whod listen, if theyd seen a wire-haired brown and white spotted Jack Russell Terrier.As townsfolk shook their heads dolefully, he pointed to his telephone number on the sheet, just in case.Every day after school he rode through town, not really expecting any luck, but too restless to sit at home and dwell on his depression.After two weeks his hope petered out, like the last sliver of orangey sun dipping below the horizon.It tortured her entire being- hearing her son softly sobbing every night as he sat by his window, his eyes straining to see a flash of white fur in the moonlight.Well get another dog, Marie-Claire said one morning at the table, then quickly added, only when youre ready of course.I keep expecting to see Ralph running up the driveway to greet me after school. Andy said, fresh tears burning tracks down his baby-soft cheeks.They both knew he wasnt ready for a new dog; he knew she was trying to cheer him up.Thats why you havent had Richie or Sam over isnt it?Mom intuition.Andy nodded, Its not that Im afraid to cry around them.Richie was a wreck after Cooper died.I just dont want them to feel bad.Sadness is uncomfortable to be around.Mom had to turn to her potato peeling then, her turn to only nod.He sounded forty.That night, Andy left his curtains open, as he did every night now.He still wondered about that weird light he had dreamed about at 3am.Deep down he knew it was connected to Ralphs disappearance, but he chased those imaginative thoughts out of his mind like a mob armed with pitchforks.Thoughts like that froze the blood of his body and brought the taste of bile to his throat.He dreamt of circular metal ships and big-eyed stick figures with shiny titanium sharks teeth.Morning brightness pressed against his eyelids.When he realized it was not warm summer sunlight, his eyes flew open like pistol shots.It was unnaturally silent again, just as before- no crickets, no owl, no lullabying birds.It was just as it had been two weeks before and he knew when he looked at the clock it would 3am.He was paralyzed with dread, while his guts vibrated like live wires.theyHis room was northest Siberia, his toes in danger of frostbite and his teeth chattered like the windup ones they sold at the magic and gift shop.He turned and reached for the hoody on his bedpost.When he turned back to the brightly lit window,Ralph was there!Just before the light winked out, Andy noted that Ralph was not statue-still this time.His stubby, sausage-like tail whapped uncontrollably against the floor making soft  sounds.In the pitch darkness, Andy whispered, Ralphie?Ralphie was  cat-like either, he happily bounded over in two strides and leapt up to the bed.The crickets outside started up as Andy found the light-switch.He hugged Ralph so hard the dog made a wheeze and a yip.Sorry boy, said Andy.He looked into Ralphs furry facesomething was odd.But whatever it was eluded him, the small bedside lamp shed little light.Andy tilted the shade towards Ralph, but he still couldnt put a finger on the oddness.Where have you been? Andy asked, agog with pure bliss- his best friend was home! he thought.They used to be such a dark shade of brown they looked black in low light. The dogs eyes now swam with flecks of gold, the amber irises glowed as if not from the moonlight coming in in window, but from within the dogs very essence. eyes.He didnt know what that meant, only that it felt right.Just like you knew Yoda was super smart before he even opened his little green mouth.Did you have an exciting adventure?Andys eyes widened with wonder as Ralph nodded., thought Andy.Where did you go?Oh, wait- thats dumb.You cant .Can you?Ralph shook his head left to right.But you really do understand me, dontchoo boy?Ralph nodded.Tail thumping on the quilt.MOM!!!MOOOOOOOM!!!"

A Silly Little Game,"Did you know that mommys gonna die today? Lou asked with her mouth full of cereals. She gazed at her father with her big blue eyes and nodded assertively while spilling milk all over the kitchen table. Andrew lifted his head from his morning newspaper, his lips curled in amusement. Oh no! he exclaimed in a pretended voice. Now how is mommy going to die today, then? Is she going to die the same way as yesterday?The scent of coffee began to fill the richly decorated kitchen and the vigorous light of the morning sun was breaking through the curtains, illuminating the ivory marble floor. He listened to Lous imaginative tales with pleasure, adding a comment here and there to heighten the grotesqueness of their little game, which she approved of with a giggle.After his third cup of coffee, he glanced at the clock  it was already well past 8 AM.Now hurry up, my dear, Andrew said. Or else we will be late for kindergarten again, and we dont want that to happen after what Miss OHara has told us last time, do we?Lou shook her head with such force that, for a moment, her face disappeared beneath her long unkempt hair. She wolfed down the remainder of her cereal bowl and went upstairs to get dressed. Meanwhile, Andrew contemplated on having another cup of coffee and, as he was pouring the last bit from the kettle into his mug, he started to think about the next chapter of his historical novel in progress on the Thirty Years War that he originally intended to undertake that day. Just the thought of it caused him a headache, so instead, he tried to focus on the bitter aftertaste that the coffee was exerting on his tongue. His mind kept wandering off to his dysfunctional relationship with Annie. Ever since she had taken over the CEO position in the insurance company, things started to go downhill between the two of them. It was probably already sometime before that, but he liked to think that it was her occupational and financial success that was responsible for his misery. She was barely at home anymore, and he couldnt remember when they last had dinner together, not to mention sex. He wasnt even sure whether she came home at all, and he wondered whether all this had eventually enticed him to engage with Lous silly little game.Ready to go? Lou yelled from down the hall.He startled and replied, Yes, dear. Andrew placed his mug down near the stove and made his way down the hall. Lou stood next to the front door, impatiently tapping her foot on the ground and smoothening her favourite little jumper that was beaming like a rainbow. She handed Andrew his jacket and noticed a fresh coffee stain on her father's shirt, but didn't say anything. So tell me, how was your day at kindergarten, my dear? Andrew asked his daughter while slicing the potatoes for dinner. The oven was pleasantly humming in the background and the smell of roast chicken and rosemary gradually began to spread in the kitchen.We didnt do nothing special, really, she said., my dear,  special, he corrected her, and let the chopped potatoes plunge into the saucepan full of water.But I think Miss OHara will want to speak to you again  she and the other children seemed taken aback when I told them how mommy was gonna die today. I dont know  they never take it the way you take it, daddy. I wish they were more fun, just the way you are! Lou said.He gave her a warm smile and chuckled. Now, now, my dear. Weve been through this. You mustnt talk about your little game at kindergarten. Indeed, you mustnt talk about it . You see, people may misunderstand you, just as Miss OHara has already in the past, and then daddy gets a whole lot of phone calls and has to explain to all these people that nothing of what you said is meant seriously and that there is indeed no need to worry whatsoever. Now, he said, his voice becoming softer again, are you hungry?After a hearty dinner, Lou settled down in her room with her crayons and her colouring book, the door left ajar. Andrew, meanwhile, had nestled down in his favourite armchair with a mystery novel and a cup of tea in the living room. He read it with such excitement, invariably thinking of how wonderful it would feel if he himself could write so grippingly, that he did not hear the phone ringing.Daddy daddy, the phone is ringing. It must be Miss OHara who will want to speak to you about today, Lou yelled from her room.Reluctantly, he put the novel away and wearily got up from his armchair. He deliberately moved slower than usual towards the phone in hopes that the ringing might stop before he reached the receiver, but it didn't. Andrew glanced at the display and, with displeasure, he saw the digits of an unfamiliar number. For a moment, he was tempted to leave the phone ringing but then decided against it. Anxious to not let his displeasure of receiving a call at this late hour become discernible, he cleared his throat and picked up the phone. Andrew swallowed hard. He put down the receiver and stood in the living room like a wax figure. Except for the ticking of the parlour clock and the light scratching noise of Lous crayons, there was nothing but silence. He slowly approached his daughters room and pushed the door wide open. Lou, my dear, there is something that I must tell you. Something bad, something very bad, has happened. Your mother Oh you dont need to tell  daddy, she interrupted him playfully with a bright smile on her face. You see, I already . In fact, I told you so this morning, didnt I?"
Destiny of Chris and Ping.,"For the quote saying I wandered everywhere, through cities and countries I went, the world was on my side., a man named Chris always believes in this quote but his life was unlucky. His life is poor, unsuccessful and he had no wife. He thought his life was useless and he was worthless for anyone. He tried hard to find a job but he couldnt get what he liked. When he was unlucky on the 11th of November, he bought a lottery no. 11 but he was unlucky as usual. One day, he got a recommendation from someone to visit the wisest man at the hill for advice to improve his luck..During his journey, he met the thin wolf. It said it was thin lacking food for a long time. It asked Chris whether he ask the wisest man for an opportunity to help it. He accepted that he would ask for it. Then he met a lazy farmer, he said he is poor, he had only the farm, not the treasure from the parents like other people. He asked Chris whether he could ask the wisest man for the opportunity to improve his situation. He said yes, he would ask for him..And during the trip, there is a millionaires house having a beautiful daughter. The man is so sad. He told the man to ask the wisest man how to make him be happier..Then when Chris went to the hill where the wisest man lived, he recommended him to go home, this time he could find opportunity around him and will be lucky..Hes glad that he would be lucky. So he went to the millionaires house and he told him that he was unhappy because his daughter was still single. If she married someone, he would be happy. So he asked Chris whether he was single and would like to marry the girl, he said that he was sorry, he must be in a hurry to go home for his lucky life..He went to visit the farmer. He told the farmer to be diligent in doing the farming for money. The farmer persuaded him to do it together but he refused the opportunity. He said thank you but he would be in the hurry to go home for his opportunity..He met the wolf, He told the wolf that it should eat the first food that first met. So the wolf tried to kill Chris and eat him..When the opportunity came, we should not miss it. It is like the wolf, in this case, it didnt miss the opportunity offered by the man so it ate the man. Not like Chris that missed two opportunities offered by the millionaire and the farmer..This story told about Chris who would like to change his life but not do anything so he cannot have a happy life. It is not like when the man travels through the woods, again and again, be lucky to avoid the wolf every time, but the wolf only needs enough luck to find you once...Comparing to another person, Ping. She had to study hard for the future. While she studied, she had to help her mother selling vegetables in the market for money to study. She dreamed to be the author, but her family would like her to study in another field like accounting as it would be a more secure job..She had to choose a major according to her mothers recommendation but she didnt do it well. Her exam result showed that she was not specialized in this field. She didnt leave her dream, she had her hobbies like writing poems, songs, and short stories. She sent them to a contest or send some poems and songs as a gift on friends birthday..So shes graduated and worked as an author and songwriter. However, she did it as a small business while she had to control about financial stuff and accounting things of the company..Its worthwhile that her experience might not be happy at first that she didnt study in the field she loved most but she developed her talent and skill as the strength and use the knowledge she learned to do business in her life. This was because she knew what she loved best and she did it and worked hard. This can create luck and change her life. As the quote of Thomas Jefferson saying that we are great believers in luck and we find that the harder we work and try, the more we have of it..What we learned from this story is when we have a recommendation from someone, we have to know how to apply that recommendation into our life wisely to benefit us the most..It is like Chris that missed two opportunities because he thought the wisest man said to him that he must be hurried to reach home and got the opportunity at home. He didnt know that the opportunity did not come at the destination, it can come along your journey..Chris and Ping are different. Chris waited for the opportunity at home but have no chance to get it because the wolf ate him or he might come back home doing nothing the same as before as he didnt accept two opportunities from two people he helped first. Ping created the opportunity, though she didnt have a chance to study in the faculty of arts, she still followed her dream of being a writer. She still practiced writing songs, poems, and short stories and got a job as an author finally even she didnt study in that field. The knowledge of accounting helped her in business and made dot for her success in her future. This taught us about how to be a successful person. Which kind of person would you like to be? I bet you would like to be like Ping, right? So opportunity waits for no one, if it seems like you have no opportunity now, create it. Knock the door of opportunity hard and with attention, Im sure the god would hear that and open the door for you in some ways. Thank you for reading my story. "
a summer kidnapping,"Recently tis come to my attention that I have been kidnapped. When I wrote about this and no one cared a long, long time ago I felt disappointed. After all, most of the people I wrote to owed me for this is this or that is that. What can I, am single-footed single eyed pirate, a poet a writer in Bolivia do for such a wide and wild assortment of people? I was and am who I always will be. A personality like now you will know.Let me begin with the summer that I think this began. 1973 I was crying. Why? My parents were yelling and screaming and excited.And? That night an angel, or at least what I thought was an angel, appeared and I think that is where I will awake after this horrible dream is over. Back in 1973.. Oh wait.. It could not be 1973. For you see the real date today 2021 is 2013 dont you see. Spacetime kidnapping of souls that should have gone to heaven and ended up in hell is the most devious of stories I find these days.So the year must have been 1965? In yet I was born in 1971 in this realities calendar? Which was real? A twist of time is terrible, dont you see. For I am the luckiest to be born at the wrong time in a right place to be stolen. No, not by Peter Pan, but the Montauk group? Who can say? I know I am not from here, that is for sure. And you? If I am telling you this story has been dead billions of years, for I saw your future. And? I have seen it perish too.That is how it works in a closed time curved loop reality after all. You may destroy me. You may destroy my poetry. You may laugh at my stories. But I am afraid in the end. I will remember who I am? And you? You were a passing summer tale I will remember at the age of four. And I hope forget to be honest. Not much I like about this tale.Surely there was some good and decent folks here? I imagined that for the longest time. I imagine heroes and battles and victory for mankind. Now?I see a Dyson sphere or heaven in the night sky. And? If Microsoft patent 2000060606 is the mark in Revelation, we or you are all dead and become a virus to the sphere. And?You can not get into it. Nor can I, most likely. However I still have apart to play. A small part. You see, I am still dying and until I do. There is hope for me. And for you? Repent if you can. Pray if you can. An ending is an end, and you had a life once without this story. Lived it to the end of time. And? Now, this is your second life. A chance to change your ways to repent if you can. And will you?I doubt it. Fate is fickle. That was the summer of 1973. Then in summer of 1978. I am pretty sure I died. And? My soul trapped elsewhere for a time prior to President Carter nuking the hell out of Russia in some long ago forgotten reality.Then again in 1984 I know it changed yearly up to 1990. And now? I have no idea where my real soul belongs. And I wonder summers spacetime among those Mandela effected people realizing that Montauk project is real and hating people for this evilness towards me.Not a good summer. In yet.Summer is something at times.I now am in a Bolivia where I am freezing my feet off for somehow my 73 degree home has chilled and reality shifted that instead of 2500 due west of where south America is today and 300 miles north Bolivia La Paz is where it is today.Meaning?I am closer to the south pole for some reason I need warmth where I used to be finely heated and cooled each night.Sagittarius to Orion ventures again.. So where do I find myself this fine summer?Someplace I hate? Not really. To be honest, I dont hate. I can see your stories. I understand your desires.However, they cost me. And personally I have not been paid back. And?Well, all good story tellers know there is a payment at the end of a story such as this.You lived your life once without payment, twice without payment, even up to seven times without payment.And now? I am passing back through here whence I was and whence I came and in my parting writing tales of this is this and that is that for all who can read them.For what? Fate is real. Either you are fated to be accepted by God or his story has thrown you out. OR?For those Mandela effected there are other ways. Not pleasant to realize you are the other in the bible. Still beats dying in hell. And reality is what to a person who has claimed to spacetime travel and timed travel via closed time curved loop billions of years. What is that to you or me?To me? It is has been an adventure. Not a pretty one. But nevertheless an adventure. And God?Well, God is real.. And beyond that who else can say what is or is not real.So here I am still kidnapped since 1973 or 1965 and still have not seen my real home or summer in all those years.  What will it be like to reach home?As a kidnapped person I can say I expect maybe a little less or more than what I see here. For you see. These are the mirror realities of those worlds that real in heaven.And? Once upon a time a great evil happened and you either are in my ghost story or I am in your ghost story this summer."
Road trips during the summer?,"I have gotten to go to many places during the summer.  From Ekalaka, Montana the end of the world.  To Colorado Springs, Colorado springs hidden in the mountains.  To Caracato Bolivia to Sunnyvale California to Orlando Florida to Goleta California to Richmond Washington to Tuscon Arizona.  I have traveled via truck from Plentywood Montana to Topeka Kansas.  From some small place in Oklahoma through Texas egad their bugs are huge and days hot all the way to Billings Montana.  Road trips?  Which was the most memorable?I think the road trip from Denver Colorado to Austin Texas when I died makes for a good story.I had just given up on Orion capsule and decided to move within five days from Denver to Austin Texas. Some road trip no?  I got one of those 35 huge travel loading vans. Packed everything up and worked Friday planning to make the trip Friday to Monday to Austin Texas.It was hot.  IT was eekie.  The night I left Denver Colorado was 5 PM. I handed in my security clearance my paperwork and had my van with car attached in the parking lot.No far well to me this time. Sad? Not really I was a b normal my last good far well was Orlando Florida sometime ago.Anyway I had planned to make three hundred miles by 11PM.  So there I was driving and all of a sudden a tire wheeled by me like in one of the movies.  It speed up and hit a truck that was in front of me.  Then bounced into the middle of the highway divide.  It was something.  A mobile home unit on a flatbed had lost two tires. Meaning? They were bouncing along the road and the truck was coming to a stop and I was forced into the passing lane and went by it.Sort of a wild first two hour drive.  Then something else happened and I ended up in some New Mexico town with a prison system.  Now in the middle of the night alarms went off and I got a knock on my door to ensure I was me and so forth by to be honest I am no longer sure.Next morning I am driving and making good time when all of a sudden I hear honking behind me.  My car tow for my vehicle had blown.  I had been driving with a threaded tire for sometime.  I pulled into a Indian smoke shop called the company who said they would have someone out there to replace the tire.A meal later and several hours passed by and I am talking to a guy from the east coast who was now the security guard for this area.  It was isolated and for the world of me if I was from there I would have picked up and left. Meaning why stay in a desert.  We talked. About this is this and that is that.  Evidently he use to be some sort of manager for rock bands. Got into trouble dealing their coke and drugs.  He had gotten tired of that gave it up to hide I suppose on the reservation.Finally the guy comes realizes that my description of the situation was correct has to do something with the the alignment of the tow. Meaning I had to remove my car etc. So I lost nine hours of driving.  At around 8 PM I finally got my car back on the tow and got out of there.  Now you would think I would probably just want to call it a day. Screw that. I drove until 4 AM and ended up on some mountain top in Texas where they had decided to erect in the middle of God foresaken country a border patrol so there I was stuck at 4 AM at night in a seventeen mile line of cars trying to move up a mountain. The van water pump starts to gulp.  By the time make it out of there the water pump makes the van go like 20 mph.  And I am the middle of no where. I pull over into Radiator Springs New Mexico and van dies.Now New Mexico at this time no gas stations for the pass 150 miles were open. Meaning? Everything had gone belly up and the roads looked like something out of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Meaning dead cars along the road, on the side roads it looked like a trailer park had decided to take all the 70s trailers from horror movies and twist them up and leave them there for the tourist such as myself to try to puzzle out. A how did they get there? B why would someone leave it there? C I sure hope there is no one living there.Anyway I get there to Radator Springs and the only thing around is a clinic and it was closed.  The van died so I had to un tow my car again and drive to find a phone because my phone had died too.  And the company owning this rented adventure I think one of the ladies thought I might have died for my story at that time included heat, possible stroke because I had ran out of water and well life in general for this tale was not going so well.  To top this off my kids pet gold fish decided the ice was not enough and cooked in my cooler.Now you would think this is some adventure.  This was after all Saturday June and hot.  Well after getting my car off the tow driving to a place to call. I had to wait a few more hours until 8 PM for the tow truck to pick things up.  They did Sunday they confirmed they could not fix the van until Wednesday because they could not get the part. Now you have never been on a road trip with me. I had in the mean time gotten another rental truck remember 35 feet worth of stuff and tow car and wola I had three people move my stuff from A to B van by 2 PM Sunday.  I was off again by 230 PM.  Sure I am pretty sure I died in Radiator Springs but my gold fish did and I was off.  At 5 AM Monday Morning I pulled into Austin place of work.  Hooped into a shower shaved and was dressed for work my first day.  That is a short version of my road trip from Denver Colorado to Austin Texas June summer 2012.  Yes I am pretty sure I died somewhere along the way there. Exactly where I am not sure. But I did stop work and start work as if nothing happened and the trip from hottest desolated place in New Mexico?  Well it got my gold fish."
Febuary 31st,"February 31stByDodge It was the sun rise of the first February 31st, a new beginning, another new beginning. Yet another benign attempt to see us through. The first day of summer used to be a promise of sawyer and huckleberry adventure now it became a attempt of nigh confused solstice.About three years ago all the scientists admitted they were wrong. That no one knew facts versus fission from the sovereignty of death, the brave had fallen in vain to the exploits of mobviolence and social shunning. The first day of summer almost seemed a cruel winter, and I'm sad to say it was mostly my fault.We had played it cool, copasetic, not trying to ruffe a few feathers but like crows in a flock we were on our way to murder. I spoke lies by the dollar and made not too much, the pockets being lined didn't matter too much to me as long as I sat comfortable in a sharp tie.There were shows no more than five minutes at a time, I had a chin you could trust, the cameras would roll, as I played mine. It started as a sandwich in the grocery line. I ordered a simple sandwich in the most confident voice. It would have been easy to say I didn't really care about anything but I struggled.No one wrote my lines, I made it up as I went along but made damn sure the context could be subversive, as if a deliberate wink. Truth be told, I always wanted to be an actor in shape or form merely to escape reality for a moment, then there was my found ability to shape it.Cruelty amused and wit seemed unconscious I didn't believe what I was saying, then again that wasn't my job. My gathering for this occupation was not about what I believed it was about what I could make others believe. Soon I wasn't eating in line. I was having dinner with elbows that carried great fists.Could you blame me? Some have tried. I would straw man them in a news segment and move on to calamari and over priced whiskey, my eyebrows were on point and I never missed a good quip. Caviar only tastes good when you know others want some.Like most, I grew up far away from the north pole and I understood that most people don't give a damn about what's not happening in their backyard, my backyard by the way has two guest houses and a pool that sings on to infinity.Would you fault a bricklayer for an amazing road? Then why fault me for my personable disposition, I dare say borderline folksy.February30th took a great deal, I'm proud of that. Conviction and emotional debate, when I came up with the concept (off the cuff by the way) I had no clue it would strike a chord. Before you knew it the calendar came into question, we literally clawed off a day in June to make it happen.It was a full on campaign, tv spots, bus tours, lectures at universities that would never accept me on paper, yet in person they folded to my whim. I gave speeches to my old alameda that I had dropped out of with no diploma in hand. I got a standing ovation.I preyed on anger and insecurity, no one wants to feel dumb, i wasn't dumb, I was ignorant. I hate the taste of caviar but I relish the tinge of great champagne.I could never be married, even though the subject did come up that I should have a few mistresses. I once dated a woman for three months and never even met, that's the job. Her song reached number two on the charts, her third single reached number one when we broke up.They called me a sociopath, but that's farther from the scope of what I am, I feel, I'm just not too concerned, I never strived to do wrong but then again I never strived to do good either, I just wanted success and that's what I got. Go me.The future may thank me, the present for the most part already is, buffoons loudly praise me and brilliant minds waste their time to mention me. My bills are paid and then some. I eat at the finest green rooms.I won't apologize, I'm triumphant. Not many have made such an impact in so little time: five minutes with careful words and an agenda is all you need, sometimes a callback after a commercial.It's February 31st, the first one in recorded history and I made it happen! Daylight savings time gone, yeah that's me too, I accomplished more being a pundit that most politicians do in a lifetime, I coerce, I enable I make the public. I make change.I get to combine the freedom of free speech and the free market, if anyone takes me too seriously well that's on them isn't it, its just a job. don't like it try not to listen, I'm catchy.My shoes are made of the finest fabrics and they refuse to tip toe, only direct when needed and soft enough to slip away. I own seventy-seven watches, I cant tell time but I like to glance at them to avoid questions I don't know the answers to. A simple trick to make them think I'm bored.Followers will follow, talkers will talk. nature takes its course, I'm not accountable for the chagrin, if anything I'm a orator of needs for means, I'm a gifter of purpose. I learned how to tie a Windsor knot.	February 31st, my follow up to February 30th, I might be mistaken,  Caesar was the last one to oversee the changing of the days, what great company to keep.For all I've done though on this auspicious day, a historic day,I can't seem to understand why I'm walking out at dawn to see a full moon."
"Rest Now, Friend","I sat in the wide bay window of my grandfathers old cabin, one of those old log structures barely holding on by loose nails and scraps of insulation. It was a weary place, but the squeaking metal fan on the table provided a breeze and the spices and vegetables slowly stewing on the stove wafted warm and comforting odors around the small room. I turned my attention away from the stained paperback I found on top of musty sheets in the hope chest to where a white bunny circled the area around a fallen tree and he looked... famished.I watched him silently and carefully, hopefully, held on to his every move. 	It looked as though my long-eared friend was onto something. He seemed to be digging with purpose, but I couldn't quite make out why. , : A lone radish had grown in the forest, probably the result of a stray seed absentmindedly dropped by a passing bird or carried by the fur of an animal. But all at once, a mysterious rustling came from a bush just beyond the field of sight of my small bunny. Could mean trouble. He heard the noise, too; his sensitive whiskers quivered at the hint of imminent danger.  	It was simply a deer. He posed no threat in a predatory sense, but he still stood above our bunny in the food chain, which didn't dispel some semblance of risk. Wishing to avoid an encounter, he hopped away to safety. In his escape, however, my bunny had forgotten his wild radish and left it conveniently uncovered for another hungry, herbivorous creature. 	The deer took my... no,  bunny's dinner for himself. Our friend retreated to his warren in the roots of the upturned tree. It's simple, homemade comforts must have provided some consolation to help pass another hungry night. Twilight fell on the peaceful forest, a twilight who arrived unaware of the struggles she both soothed and concealed. The crickets began to stir, performing their rehearsed, melodious rhapsody. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminated a purple summer sky and threw frightening, yet benign, shadows on the walls of our bunnys home and of my own cabin. 	Even the deer, at last, had to rest. Because of this fact of nature, our erstwhile antagonist retreated into the deep stand of trees to dream of the next day's pointless battles and rest comfortably with a full stomach. I sensed the a fog of sleep encroaching on me, yet I couldn't force myself to retreat to my bed and abandon the bunny from my mind. I wrapped myself tightly in a faded sheet and rested my head on the cool window pane. 	Upon my midnight waking, a storm was rumbling to the surface of the clouds overhead and threatened the foundation of my cabin with sweeping winds and fat drops of rain. My eyes darted out the splattered window. Dear reader, if a definition of bravery exists, this must have been it. Our lone bunny faced off against the elements, ineffectually protecting his solemn home by pushing around some moss with his pink nose. It was a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes those are all we have. Even the bunny knew this.  	The wind continued to roar and it was becoming ever clearer that Mother Nature had not just knocked on the door. She was ready to come in, sit down, kick off her boots, and pour herself a drink. Our bunny had no family, no friends, no loved ones of any kind except his lone observer and her audience, lying anonymously in wait of his next moves. 	The rain picked up more and more as small puddles gathered around the entrance of our bunnys cozy abode. They continued to grow in size and connect to one another, prepared to mount an impersonal attack on our dear bunny. I thought,  	And yet, is it? Is nature about destruction or about life? It seemed to me like this unflagging little hero of a bunny may have had some help after all. A family of beavers looked on in curiosity, perhaps in consideration of taking up the cause to protect our friend. Often called natures best architects, the intrepid mammals spared no effort to shore up the endangered burrow.  	A small brown thrush, seemingly bold in the rain, approached the unlikely rescue team. I half-expected to see a few of these scamps out in weather like this, hoping for stray seeds to fall from hidden branches or worms to emerge and soak up the wet, but to see one at that moment was a rare treat indeed. The little beauty was far from her natural habitat and had abandoned her usual reserve to join the merry, albeit uncommon, band. 	Ive heard it said by old students of the natural world that a storm will sometimes urge those in danger to protect one another, even if they may never interact in times of peace and prosperity. Sometimes those old recluses know that theyre talking about. 	Our abnormally feisty thrush pitched right in to save the small rabbit hole, belied it's powerful wings and small size to move sticks and roots to-and-fro in the back of the hole, and increased the size while the beavers continued to reinforce the front and sides with straw.  	The supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world -- all too often its most salient quality -- were washed away, as if by storm, by the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin. 	Morning came.  	In the pale light of the rising sun, few signs remained of the summer storm that battered the glen, save the dampness of the ground, strewn leaves, and a hot sense of cacophony that lingered in the air. The beavers finished their work and headed home. The thrush returned to wander the woods for leftover grubs and berries. Maybe she found her way back to the hollowed out trunk she once resided in, maybe she forged herself a new shelter. Our sweet bunny was exhausted and could finally rest easily knowing his home was secure. 	But alas, as in life, our bunnys rest was short-lived. The leaves on a nearby bush rustle once again, not from wind, but from the force of movement. The deer was back. Perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of our bunnys protective barricade, he tested the situation with his hooves. I, much like our bunny, was unsure of where this would lead. 	With a single smash from the deers powerful front hooves, the  burrow was under attack. Our friend hopped to safety far from where the deer -- provoked by what, I will never be certain -- sparred with his home and could only watch as he continued the relentless rampage. A couple more mighty movements and the dam 	The dam had been breached. 	Water flooded into the small enclosure, swept away the bed of leaves our bunny once rested on, and thrashed against the new walls. The deer continued its attack with more than enough misplaced rage and superior size to topple the weakened walls. They started to give. Even the deer, in his blind fury, seemed to sense what was going to happen as he stepped to one side. 	The sound of the walls cracking, crushed by the weight of the tree it is built into, was deafening. Not because it was loud but because it showed that our small bunny, despite his found family of beaver and bird, had lost the home he fought so hard to protect. 	It was all over. The warren had been destroyed. An injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me even now. 	And yet, what was this? Our bunny was on his feet, using his thin whiskers to assess his new surroundings. Perhaps even the deer was impressed because, as if confused by the events, he turned into the woods and retreated to the brush. 	My friends, the spirit of this bunny was indomitable! 	There was something bigger at work here, something our dear bunny was finely in tune to. His strife did not define him, but his ability to keep fighting. His loneliness did not define him, but his ability to accept companionship and love. Our bunny curled up in his new home, a home that was both irreparably different and yet, in spirit, all the same. 	I unwrapped the sheet and padded across the room towards the light switch. After flicking the dim bulb off, the room was lit by a stream of yellow sunlight that left small rainbows on the walls as it ricocheted through the raindrops left on the window.  The world can be cruel and indifferent, such is the way of nature. But in it, there is the kindness of strangers and our incontrovertible ability to make ourselves a home.  The bunny rested. And finally, my friend, I hope you can rest, too."
Feathered ashes.,"There once was a book store in the south that not many people outside the realm knew or cared about. There was nothing particularly enchanting of the place that would set it aside from other book stores around the world. Just like any other book store, there were rows and rows of books. Books stacked along the wall, books creating inconspicuous piles on random patches of floor, books creating shelves to house more books. The low lighting and leather-bound chairs gave off a sense that this was more than just a bookstore, but in fact a home. Which in our story, the book store was indeed doubled as a home for one Ms. Jade, who lived on the second-floor apartment. The bookstore belonged to her mother who then passed it onto her daughter after her peaceful passing. Ms. Jade had a brother, he unfortunately wanted very little to do with his family. In fact, you could say, he wanted nothing to do with his family and has lived that way for the past 12 years. Ms. Jade had lived by her lonesome in the bookstore for 11 years. Just her and a horde of books living in solitary. For the first time in what felt like too long, Ms. Jade cried and cried deep. The type of tears that seem to have broken a dam of emotion deep inside and will not relent until the tears have been spent. Aside from interaction from customers and varied acquaintances that sometimes stop for tea, Ms. Jade barely utters a peep to herself. Her loneliness seemed to have swallowed her whole and blanketed her down on her bed. Sobs and all crying silently into a bookstore on a rain hissing night.Do you believe in magic? More importantly, do you believe in the magic that a book can bring? This mystical ability that can teleport us, transform us and above all, teach us? Well, in this story Ms. Jade is going to learn about a new type of magic that some special books have. Ms. Jade woke up to a snot and tear stained pillow as she lifted her head to turn off her alarm clock. It was the second Tuesday of the month, new inventory day. The gentleman from the loading company was finishing unloading the order of books Ms. Jade had requested when he realized that there was one book out of place on his truck. ""Hey lady,"" he so eloquently began, ""I think that book is part of your order."" Ms. Jade looked back to see the red leather-bound book with a lock keeping the book secure from opening. Ms. Jade looked at the book with a quizzical look. ""Don't you guys usually wrap these orders with shrink wrap? How'd this one get out?"" The gentleman just shook his head, ""If you don't want it, I can take it back with me, but it would more than likely be incinerated as unknown."" Appalled, Ms. Jade took the book and shoved it in the pocket of her sweater. ""That's alright thank you, I will take it as part of my order."" If there was one thing Ms. Jade despised it was seeing a book being mistreated or destroyed. As she put her boot on the pivot point of the moving dolley Ms. Jade could've sworn that she felt a sort of kick or beat from the book in her pocket. She immediately shook her head and dismissed it entirely, thinking nothing more of it. She then went about her daily chores completely forgetting about the book she possessed in her sweater. The book liked the attention and was getting to know it's new friend. The book was not particularly happy when it got too hot for Ms. Jade and she took off her sweater to begin making her dinner. It would dampen most anyones spirit having to cook for one on a starry filled full moon night. Ms. Jade stared into the twinkling sky as her water came to a boil. She took a deep breath and allowed herself to remember that her mother used to love looking at the stars. Ms. Jade was not a person to always be sad, especially at times like now, where she felt connected to both her mother and brother. Ms. Jade believed her mom was looking down on both her kids. She was enjoying the scenery and cool autumn breeze until what sounded like a muffled knocking coming from inside her house. She looked all around unable to find the source of the sound. As she walked back toward the kitchen she froze in horror as her sweater pocket began to swing as if something alive was in there. Another couple of muffled knocks began to swing her sweater pocket again at which point Ms. Jade screamed and ran to her room grabbing the phone on her way. She slammed to the floor hugging her knees when she realized, ""Who am I going to call?"" She took a deep breath and calmed herself and began to rationalize. ""I'm obviously seeing things. It was the wind, yea the wind. I had the door open and a gust had come by to move my sweater. That had to be it."" Feeling more confident in her sanity, Ms. Jade crept out the room slowly. She was tiptoeing back to the kitchen as not to scare whatever could possibly more likely not be there. Her kettle began to whistle, and Ms. Jade gave a short cry when she heard it and was immediately amused at the ridiculousness of it all. She was putting herself in a frenzy and for what? Some nonsense about a breeze moving her sweater. Ms. Jade was beginning to feel a bit foolish. That was until her pocket let out what sounded like, ""Help."" It wasn't in a desperate plea type of way, nor was it in a way that would alarm someone of any wrong doing. In fact, it was almost polite. Ms. Jade didn't know, she was too much in shock to decipher the tone of the ""Help."" Ms. Jade grabbed her broom that stayed next to the refrigerator and aimed the top of handle at her pocket. ""What?"" She began, a bit hysterically, ""Why did you just talk?"" After a couple heartbeats and no answer, Ms. Jade was beginning to ask herself is she was going crazy. A daring side of Ms. Jade was edging her to take the book in the pocket and open it as another part of her was thinking it was some sort of witchcraft. She looked around, didn't really feel in danger. Didn't feel any negative auras or anything of the like. In fact, Ms. Jade was beginning to feel quite calm. She reaches into her sweater pocket and lays the book on the table. As she sits down, she picks up the book and begins inspecting it. It was a rather odd-looking book. The leather bounding was beautifully done with gold Corinthian scrolls within the spaces of the three-ridged spine. In the middle spine there was the title, ""Unequal Magic."" Ms. Jade thought the title was a bit odd, just like the book itself. It was especially odd that there was no author listed anywhere outside of the book. ""Well that's weird."" She thought. Looking at the lock and realizing she had no key, she began to investigate to see any other way to open the book. There was a convenient latch on the side and a small 'tick' alerted Ms. Jade that the book had been unlocked. Sitting down she opened to the middle of the book and found the page to be empty. ""Weird."" She said to herself and set the book on the table open, getting up to fix her tea. Unknown to Ms. Jade, the pages of the blank leather-bound book slowly turned fire red. It looked as if a fire were being lit in between the pages. Ms. Jade looked back in fright dropping her tea as what appeared to be molten lava spuming onto her table. She stared in shock as what appeared to be a bat wing emerge from the oozing of lava immediately followed by a snake like head screeching as the bat wing appendage desperately grasps for any holding. The creature coming forth finds its way out of the book. Ms. Jade stares at what appears to be a dragon. A dragon that just came from some magic lava coming from her book. Trying to process all of it was simply too much. What drove her to passing out was the fact that the dragon faced her and without moving its lips or mouth, she could hear it say, ""Thanks."" Ms. Jade came to a couple hours later. As her eyes fluttered open she could see she was in her kitchen, but a faint glow of a fire could be seen coming from downstairs in the bookshop. Immediately thinking her mothers legacy was burning Ms. Jade sprinted down the stairs ready to face any danger she may face. To her shock, there was no danger at all. The fire burning was one lit in the fireplace roaring rather healthy one would say. The thing Ms. Jade was attempting to blink away was the appearance of a dragon the size of a chihuahua with wings holding a book as if it were reading in her favorite reading chair. She heard a voice in her head, ""I am not merely looking at the barbaric squiggles, I am indeed reading this rather tasteful treat."" Ms. Jade went slack jawed. "" I'm telepathic, which is why I can talk to you in your language and in your head."" The tiny dog sized mythical creature said as it moved its head to look at Ms. Jade. ""Can you talk normal? Like, move your mouth so I'm not as freaked out?"" She asked out loud. Not moving its mouth, the dragon said telepathically, ""I'm not here to make you feel any sort of comfort. And I certainly don't take orders from a human, no matter how big they are."" Ms. Jade was appalled at the creatures rudeness. She set her ego aside, she needed answers. ""So, you were the one knocking from inside the book?"" The dragon gave what seemed to be a droll stare, ""Wow, a human that can put two and two together. We have a genius. Wonderful."" Even telepathically Ms. Jade did not care for the dragons disposition. And she told it as much. ""I don't like your disposition. Remember it is my home that you are in, whatever it is I call you."" Seemingly annoyed the dragon huffed blowing out a small puff of smoke, closed the book and turned to Ms. Jade. ""Listen human, you opened the book giving me permission to stay in this seedy construction you call home."" Ms. Jade was at the point in her life where she cared little for rudeness, she was also at an age where she had no fear of voicing her distaste for it. ""Curiosity opened the book for one so no consent was given. Two, if this is the type of guest you are to be, then I ask for you to kindly leave and find yourself a new home.""The dragon cocked its head slightly to the side. If it was out of adoration or disgust Ms. Jade could not tell. What she could tell however, was that her point was made clear to the dragon. After another huff and cloud of smoke from the dragon, it moved its mouth to say, ""Very well then. Happy? Are you now amused that the tiny dragon is moving what you perceive to be my mouth and talking? The last person I talked to was not so uneasy about telepathic communication. Then again, I believe I read that the female of your race is much more demanding."" Although insulted, Ms. Jade kept her emotions in check. ""We are more demanding,"" she began as she folded her arms across her chest, ""because we are fiercer than the males of our species."" She finished giving the dragon a serious look. The dragon squinted its little eyes at her for a moment and then went back to reading. Ms. Jade knew the dragon wanted the conversation to be over, however she had more questions. Before she could ask anything, the dragon began, ""I am a book dragon. I will not give out my name because you will never have that power over me. I am older than what you call history. You think dragons no longer exist, but we exist alright. We exist thanks to magic. I popped into your world because I knew you were a book collector of some kind and I'm looking for a new book to call my home. I cannot do that now, as I am too weak and need substance. Once I devour your library I should have enough strength for another hibernation incantation to be locked inside another book of my choosing. Either that or wait a couple of months, witness the rising sun and immediately mature to my adult size."" So much information came to Ms. Jade at once that she only took note of the last part. ""So, if you witness the rising sun, you turn into a big dragon and then what?"" The dragon threw the book on the ground, ""Well if I were to witness it this morning I would die a terrible death by incineration because I don't have enough magic to protect me through the metamorphosis process."" Intrigued Ms. Jade then asked, ""Do you mind if I sit with you?"" The dragon nodded in agreement. As she took a seat Ms. Jade decided to talk to the dragon as a friend and began asking questions that a friend would ask. They talked long into the night and with several cups of tea in their systems the talking became very cordial and Ms. Jade began to know more about the dragon. She learned that dragons still existed in the world since there was still magic. Instead of eggs that were magical cocoons made for dragons by wizards, dragons made their cocoons in books of their choosing. ""There is strong magic in between the pages of book."" The dragon explained. Ms. Jade also learned that by opening the book, it gave her some power over the dragon, knowing its name would give her even more power, power the dragon was not willing to give away freely. ""I learned the wickedness of man in the pages of a book. Experiencing it was a different conundrum altogether."" Said the dragon. Ms. Jade also learned that if the dragon was to stay out of its cocoon and gain magical armor produced in the scales after a period out then the dragon could witness the sunrise and transform into a full dragon. ""Is that what you want?"" Asked Ms. Jade, ""To be a full-grown dragon I mean?"" After the question had left her lips the dragon got very quiet indeed and stared at the fire that was beginning to burn low. Staring at the embers the dragon said, ""It is very late, I am getting tired. If it's alright with you I will retire now."" Without waiting for a response, the dragon circles around the cushion of the sofa as a dog would, plops itself into a comfortable curl and closes its eyes. Ms. Jade then takes that as a sign and retires to her upstairs bedroom. ""Goodnight."" She whispers at the top of the stairs unaware that the dragon can hear her. The dragon began to feel a warmth inside that was both similar and different to the warmth of the fire.Ms. Jade awoke to something pushing on her shoulder. As she opened her eyes she saw the dragon staring at her with its intense eyes. ""I would like to see the sunrise if you would like to join me.""She got up on one arm alarmed. ""Won't you die if you go out and see the sun before you are a couple of months?"" The dragon then walked to the edge of the bed and stared at Ms. Jade. ""I have devoured your entire library. Humans have come a long way since last I was roaming the earth. You put so much beauty and art in your stories, the imagery the explanation of feelings and thoughts are simply amazing. I have never been awake for such literature. I wish to see the sunrise, I am ready."" Ms. Jade got up and got dressed and carried the dragon in the crook of her arm to the door. When she opened the door, they were immediately greeted to a dark blue almost purple sky carrying pink cotton candy colored clouds. The air was cool and smelled of fresh mountain air. The river valley in front of Ms. Jade and the dragon was a picture-perfect scene of serenity and the unmatched beauty the world has to offer. Each minute that passed shed more light on the coming day. The dragon looked upon the scene and drank every moment in. ""I've never seen the sun rise. In all my years of existence I was afraid to grow up. You get bigger, but your fear of dying increases tenfold. Everyone I knew that accepted the fire discs' blessing ended up dead. I am ready to meet them again."" Ms. Jade was taken aback by the dragons confession. The last thing she said to it was, ""Whatever this magic does to you, I thank you. Perhaps there is some growing I need to do myself."" With that the sun broke over the horizon in a spectacular blaze. The dragon looked the sun head on as its scales began to glow and slowly dissipate with the breeze. When the sun fully came Ms. Jade looked behind her to see a trail of feathered ashes never to be seen again."
Chaos spoke unto Cosmos,"A rabbit and a hare sit in a river boat, coasting along. The river is mine, says the rabbit. See how it follows the grooves in the Earth.I think the river is mine, says the hare. See how there is no reason to it.Thats not fair. None of it has reason.Then we are in agreement.The boat sways as the river drags it along. It moves languidly, with no purpose. The vessel is constructed from an unknown wood. By an unnamed carpenter. The streaks in its woodgrain have patterns which mimic the branching rivers and tributaries which it may traverse. It is said to be more of a raft than a proper river boat. The planks lay flat on the water, held tightly together by strong and fibrous leaves. A certain rabbit, and its friend the hare, have been on the raft for quite a while. It bobs in the water. The sun rises and falls in tandem. The water twists and winds and trudges like the magma far beneath it. The rabbit and its hare suffer the elements without complaint. They dont know why they travel so far, or in such direction, but only that this is their purpose. All the rabbit needs is a purpose in order to be content. The hare does not believe in such things, but is content all the same. The sun reaches midday now. It suspends itself directly overhead, like a searing, yellow eye. The wind, which skims the surface of the water, staves off some of the heat. Airflow is a kindness at this time. Or maybe just an occurrence. In either case, the relief is often appreciated. The wind is a fickle sort of ally. It is more than welcome on this midday, especially being the summer solstice. But in the winter, it bites at the skin.Am I useless then? says the rabbit. The hare doesnt know whether to spare the feelings of a friend or speak the truth. It doesnt even know if it knows the truth. We are both useless. The rabbit perceives the answer as wholly earnest. It doesnt believe in lies after all. This trait leaves it quite vulnerable to corruption, but it has yet to encounter such a thing. It will one day face nether beings, and be grossly unprepared. But for now the rabbit is fine and pure. It scratches at its short, white fur with one leg. And it nibbles at the air with little rodent teeth. Other than these few actions, the thing sits stock still, surveying the river through the little, red beads on either side of its head. The rabbit thinks itself beautiful, and assumes it was created by some mother being equally as beautiful. It cant be sure, of course. Its only memory is the river and the raft. Winding and rising and dipping among the dark waters. But it thinks the body of a rabbit is divine, and is therefore by design. These thoughts, however, never bring an end to the river, which stretches on like taffy. And it never gives the rabbit a clue as to what it is looking for. Out on the blue horizon. Do you even like my company? says the rabbit. I have to, says the hare. Because it was meant to be?The hare perceives the question as wholly ignorant. It doesnt believe in destiny after all. This trait leaves it quite bitter to faith, and it has yet to encounter such a thing. It will one day face nether beings, in fact, and be grossly apathetic. And for now the hare is mangy and thin. It twitches its head and ears, unable to force will into its own muscles. Persistently, it bites at its itching fur with long teeth. Other than these few ticks, the thing paces restlessly across the raft, surveying the river through the round, black beads on either side of its head. The hare thinks itself ugly, and assumes it was created by the unpredictable tides of nature. It cant be sure, of course. Its only memory is the river and the raft. Winding and rising and dipping among the dark waters. But it thinks the body of a hare is unruly, and is therefore created by chance. These thoughts, however, never bring an end to the river, which stretches on like taffy. And it never gives the hare a clue as to what it is looking for. In the depths of the water. I think were approaching an end soon, says the hare. The dread of the notion feels out of place amidst the clear, sunny skies. What makes you say that?Just a feeling.The hare is disappointed with this feeling. It does enjoy the company of its rabbit friend, and feels their time together is in grave jeopardy. If they truly reach the end, will they finally part ways? It seems like destiny, but only the rabbit believes in that. After much thought, the hare realizes it believes in choice, will, despite the very unwilful twitching of its head and ears. It is quite hopeless, however, for it knows the rabbit will not agree. The rabbit and the hare are scarcely in agreement. Can one live in the absence of the other? The rabbit might get eaten. The hare might drown in the riverbed. There is no one else to keep them company. Nobody. Sunlight glistens whitely on the river surface. It exposes all the uniform peaks and valleys of the waves. The river pulls at the raft, and the raft drags against the flow of the river. The water darkens the wood. The wood ripples the water. But neither the river nor the raft have any thoughts about each other. Their bodies are affected easily. The rapids may destroy the raft, and the river will be none the wiser. Still, neither has an opinion on the matter. They hold no bearing on the concern with allies and enemies. That is a concern reserved for the rabbit and the hare. The rabbit and the hare dont quite behave like allies or enemies. They dont take much action at all. The one shared belief between the two is that they will happen upon something new. A creature. Or a body. Or a being. One that talks, walks, eats, or all of the above. It is a rather optimistic belief, to which the hare is not often prone, but they hold onto it all the same. Its all they can think to find at the end of this ride. And the ride is indeed approaching a hiccup, so to speak. A mighty wind picks up as if it is the lung of the Earth. A great exhale. The water rushes anxiously, like blood through a vein. For the heart is near. Beating and drumming. The pulsing of the sun and sky join in the low music. The world is all too bright. A dark mass quickly approaches, bending over the horizon like a vast cloud. But the sky is clear. The mass is a mere outlet of the river. A saltwater bay, perhaps. For the first time, the rabbit and the hare witness the magnificence of the sea. Unlike the river, its water is black and stretches out in every direction. Salt and dampness dominate its surrounding air. Its waves follow no grooves in the Earth. They crash into each other in the spirit of a massive, glistening war, where the blood flow is simply a green, ocean foam. It is like a massacre to the rabbit.It is like liberation to the hare. The raft reaches the last border into the dark and unknowable. It pauses and spins and bobs, as if awaiting instruction. Storm clouds build on the horizon. The suns sinks behind them and leaves a coldness. Not a desolate cold, but an invigorating one. A lightning strike burns a white streak into the evening sky. Should we try the land? asks the hare. No, says the rabbit. Lets see where the water takes us."
Down The Winding River,"If I told someone that I learned one of the most important life lessons through a fever dream, they would not believe me. I mean, would you? A child, around the age of eleven, telling you that they learned about life through a dream. A dream they had on a cold winter night when their forehead burned through a fever. The dream of a winding river. And almost every time, the dream went like this. What will become of me from now on? After a while, I stopped thinking about that. Nothing changes, in this winding river of dreams, each day and night continues on. Monotony doesnt bother me. The silence in a way that no voices could be heard, the clear waters below, the rolling skies turning from night to day, day to night. All of it surrounded me. Monotony doesnt bother me. The presence of fish, peaceful fish, the boat that Im on, yes. Loneliness. It was in a way I despised. Sometimes my boat would wash ashore, sometimes I would have to push it back into the winding river. Sometimes The boat would reach rocky spots and Id brace myself. And sometimes, Id approach a waterfall.Now, waterfalls arent the scariest things, especially when seen from afar. Their beauty can have your mouth ajar. But they arent as beautiful when youre about to fall off one. Against the current, I tried to swim. My arms tiring with each move. In the end, accepting my fate, I fell. The moment I fell, I felt at peace. I mean, sure. I was about to meet my death. And yes. I was falling from who knows how high, but at the moment, I felt the peace knowing that I would finally reach the end of this boring, repetitive dream. But I didnt die. Oh no, not me, I lived. And I was back. On another winding river of loneliness. Days would pass, nights turn to days, and days to nights. My boat, miraculously intact, would sway and I would fall asleep under the stars. I thought the winding river would wind on and on, and on. I had gotten used to the monotony. The swaying of the boat, the stars seen each night, I was tired of it all. But one day, one fateful day, I saw the ocean. So shimmering and bright, I could not take my eyes off of it. In excitement, I steered my way to it, ready to bask in the salty waters. Ready to see the different types of fish that scattered the azure hues and the corals that lay on the sea bed. I thought I was prepared, I thought, I thought. The days I spent on water were smooth. My skin baking in the sunlight, soothed by the cooling of the moon. Waters cool in the morning, warm at night. I swam with the fish I saw in daylight, and slept in my canoe at night, on still waters, unlike the rocking of the river. Finally, I was at peace. Finally, it broke. The monotony was gone, the boringness was over, and now came a new life of everyday adventure. I was contented with being stuck at sea. This was a life I could get used to. As I found islands on the way, this new way of living became my Heaven. My dream, my happiness. Soft sands, whenever Id stop by an island, and the shade of trees when Id been washed ashore. It was adventure I sought. Continuous adventure, one without end. Every day, I wanted to discover something new. Look for a fish I had never seen before, look for a new kind of octopus, and open my eyes wide to anything at all. After all, people say that children are like sponges. This was a utopia, joyous, euphoric. A dream life, a dream indeed. Adventure is great to seek, and even greater to find. And adventure I found.Adventure, adventure. It didnt matter where I found it. Adventure, adventure. I sought it and I got as I wished. Where oceans, rivers, meet.Where salt meets fresh, where a current meets current.Where waves meet and recede back into the ocean. Where waves meet, where they meet. A riptide. And one day, I encountered one. Say I said to myself one day. They say that if you see unusual dark patches in the water, it could mean that theres a riptide. I looked over to the corner of the island. There seems to be one right there. I wonder how its like, to be engulfed by the waves. The dark patch of water called out to my curiosity, as I walked towards it. Yes, I will find out. And so I did. Into that dark water I stepped and was immediately dragged into open waters, no one to save me, none to ask help from. And I at first was calm, happy to feel the waters all over my body, until reality had hit me. There were sharks that bit, jellyfish that stung, orcas that could kill, sea snakes that had enough poison to kill ten men! Adventure, adventure. It is great to seek, and even greater to find. But sometimes, we must be contented with the monotony of rivers, rocking you back and forth, back and forth. Sometimes we must be contented with what were given. It is not wrong to seek more, but we shouldnt be consumed by greed. The peace in our lives was put there for a purpose, not for us to neglect, but for us to treasure. Like the rocking of the river, the peaceful river, winding down the steady stream. And whenever I awoke from this dream, I would cry and sob, grateful for everything I had. Ungrateful are we sometimes for the peace in life. Ungrateful are we because we think we do not have adventure. Our lives are perfectly balanced already, determined by who knows what! Its simply up to us, if we treasure the winding river, or get caught in an oceans riptide out of greed. Appreciate monotony, sometimes it is a better adventure than what we seek.Enjoy your time. Enjoy it as you sail down the winding river."
Phelan,"Ma, what was your dogs name when you were little? Twas Phelan, Hun! Same as our current Phelan and countless other dogs through many generations of ODonnells!Why are all our dogs always named Phelan?Ye can ask me Ma when she and Grand-da come over for dinner with Uncle Daffyd and Aunt Rosalie! Go on and play outside now. Ive got me washing to do!Mary shook her head as she watched Seamus call Phelan to him and the two of them took off running like a pair of bandits trying to run off from the tax collector. Always so full of questions, that one! She shook her head, gathered armfuls of dirty laundry and set off to the laundry room.*Their tummies full of Mas leek and potato soup and soda bread, The ODonnells and Mahoneys sat by the fireplace. Pa pulled his fiddle out of its ancient case and tuned it up. It always went out of tune in the constant salty humidity of the coast. While his pa was tuning up, Seamus saw his chance. Nan, why are all our dogs always named Phelan? Grand-da grunted, Because your three times great grandpa though he got himself a wolf for a pet a long time ago. Probably was as drunk as a bunghole as usual! Phelan means like unto a wolf in the Old Tongue, you know! So it couldnt have been a pure blooded wolf like the legend of Joel ODonnell says!Nan playfully slapped Grand-da on the back of the head. Yere telling it all wrong! Come here, Seamus! Sit on my lap and Ill tell ye the story! Uncle Daffyd rolled his eyes and exclaimed, Not that fiddle-loving wolf story again, Ma! Ye know perfectly well ye canna tame a wild wolf unless you steal him out of his den before his eyes have opened! Ye have to get them that young! And even then, they are never fully tame, are they? Yer ancestor Jojo was the village crazy! And yer story is just as cooky as he was!Nan swatted at Daffyd who ducked and laughed! He loved to tease his Ma. Seamus sat on his grandmothers lap. Tell me anyway, Nan! I want to hear the story before bedtime! Rosalie, Seamuss youngest aunt, teased him a bit: Yere just trying to delay bedtime! Seamus glared at her and put a finger to his lip in a Dont give me away! gesture! Da started playing his fiddle quietly as Grand-Ma started the story.*Your three times great-granddaddy was named Joel ODonnell. He built the cottage near the flour mill. We inherited both from him! Your Da is playing his fiddle right now! Its been passed down in our family through the generations, same as this tale about the first Phelan! Jojo, as his friends called him back then, was a grain miller by day and a fiddle player by night. And like your Grand-da said, often drunk as a bunghole from too many toasts shared with the dancers at the village balls! You see, he was a wonderful fiddle player, so the villages around his hired him to rotate through to play at their dances.One night, after the last of the dancers had left the village square, Jojo put his fiddle in its case and staggered on towards home. He was a good two miles away from his own village and had to climb to the crest of a hill before starting his descent toward the river, the mill and his nice warm bed. Twas a harsh winter and the hill was iced over. In his inebriated state, Jojo kept slipping and skidding and in one big fall, almost bashed his fiddle case. He decided that instead of taking the hill road, he would take the longer but flatter road along the river and through the woods. He was bound to arrive at his mill that way and his precious fiddle would stay intact. So, there he was, trudging through the woods, his feet crunching through the thin ice layer on top of the snow, keeping the river to his right, when he stepped into a hunters trap. Boy, did the pain ever sober him up! He tried to pry open the traps teeth but could get no leverage with just his hands. He crawled around to try and find a stick sturdy enough to pry the teeth open but stopped when he noticed a pair of glowing yellow eyes staring intently back at him. Jesus, Mary and all the Saints, protect me! A Wolf! Jojo thought, looking down at the trap, not wanting to stare straight at the wolfs eyes for fear that the beast would take that as a challenge and pounce. Jojo was more and more sober by the minute! His ankle throbbed in the trap. He was pretty sure the bone was broken, though the thick leather in his boots had kept the teeth from drawing blood. He could sense the ankle swell and could feel his own heartbeat in the wound. The wolf walked closer and closer, a gleam of hunger in its eyes, his ears alert. It was limping. It was scrawny as though he had not eaten in days. Probably that lame back paw kept it from hunting! No sign of the rest of the pack! Maybe it was an outcast! All those thoughts crowded in Jojos head in a split second. As the wolf crept ever closer, Jojo searched around for a stick and was no more successful in the attempt than he had been before. He resolved to use his fiddle as a defensive weapon. Hed bash that wolf on the head if it crept any closer! As Jojo gripped the neck, ready to swing, the wolf sat on its haunches and tilted his head sideways, in the same cute fashion puppies did when they heard high pitched noises. That gave ole Jojo an idea. Slowly, he put the fiddle in place, grabbed his bow and started playing. Surely, his wife would worry when he did not make it home! Shed send out one of their older sons to search for him. They would hear the fiddle for sure! If the wolf did not eat him first!The first notes trilled, and the wolfs head tilted even further, ears flattened back. He lowered his front paws to the ground and lay on his tummy, creeping slowly forward. Jojo stopped playing for a few seconds, long enough to toss a crust of soda bread from his knapsack to the wolf who gulped it down in seconds. Jojo played on, getting colder and colder by the minute as the winter wind picked up and swirled snow around them. Anytime he stopped playing, the wolf bared its teeth and growled, so Jojo played the longest concert he had ever played, staring at the wolf as he played. No one came for him. Of course! They were probably searching for him on the main road between the village and his millpond, and not out in the woods! Playing music kept him warm, and more importantly, awake! The wolfs warnings kept him playing. By morning, when there was noise of an approaching human, the wolf slunk away and hid in the thicket. Jojo was relieved when the hunter arrived to check his trap and freed him. The hunter could not believe his eyes when he saw what he had caught. And he asked Jojo about the big paw tracks that came so close to him, then headed out in the other direction. There was wonder in the hunters eyes. Ye must have faerie blood not to have been eaten by that wolf! As he worked to pry the trap open, the hunter apologized and said, I thought for sure Id catch that lame wolf. Hes been stealing chickens at our farm. Probably got kicked out of the pack when he went lame! See those tracks? Hes hardly putting any weight on his back leg! Did you see him? Jojo nodded, taking off his wool cap and running his finger through his coarse hair. Phewwww! What happened to your hair, Jojo? Is was auburn yesterday and now its full-on white! After resetting the trap, the hunter helped Jojo stand up on his good foot. He supported him as they hobbled away, a pair of gleaming eyes watching them go from the thicket. The village did not have a doctor, so when Jojo got home, the blacksmith set his ankle, Jojo hollering like a stuck pig, then bandaged it to immobilize it. One of Jojos sons carved him a single crutch to lean on. Chickens continued to disappear from the village coops. Jojo occasionally caught sight of that pair of gleaming yellow eyes, or of a tail disappearing into the thicket behind his house. He convinced the hunter and the other villagers to stop hunting the wolf. He claimed that even though his own ankle had healed at a funny angle and never stopped giving him pain, especially when it rained, the villagers still brought grain to be milled by a cripple! The wolf had saved his life that long night. Jojo felt sure he would have fallen asleep and would have died of hypothermia had the wolf not insisted on his playing all night long! His wolf deserved the same chance to heal! He would feed the wolf by leaving his own food in the open, behind his house and away from the chicken coops. Theyd see! Hed never steal from them again if Jojo did that! Jojo often watched from his open backdoor. Anytime he saw the wolf, he played his fiddle. He was considered daft for his strange friendship with the wolf. Eventually, the wolf filled out and became a regular sight even inside the village instead of just by Jojos house. They all got used to the wolf. Even the mothers stopped pulling their children to their chests when he passed near! The village dogs never did get used to him, though! They all growled anytime the lame wolf came near! All except for one, a female in heat. The first dog named Phelan in our family was half-wolf and half-dog. He liked fiddle music as much as his da had that night long ago when Jojo had played for his life! The wolf eventually died and was buried in Jojos backyard. Thats my backyard now! Yeve seen the flat stone by the hawthorn hedge, the one with a fiddle carved onto it and fiddle ferns around the back? Thats the wolfs grave! Or so I was told by me own Ma! When our ancestor Jojo died years later, he had had four Phelans in his life, all descendants of his nighttime wolf. Matter of fact, Jojos grave in the cemetery has four wolf foodprints carved into it, three deep and one light, right below the name Joel ODonnell! You can check this out tomorrow if you come with me to put flowers on our family graves.*Seamus nodded, rubbing sleep out of his eyes. It was way past his bedtime. That night, he fell asleep to the melancholy melodies his da played quietly downstairs and the sound of grownups teasing Nan for her belief in her ancestral tale. Seamus dreamt of the lame wolf and of his ancestor, the village cripple, Jojo. He dreamt of yellow glowing eyes in the dark. He snuggled up to his own Phelan, asleep and snoring near him on the goose feather comforter. When he woke up, he knew for sure that Grand-da and the others had it wrong and Nan had it right! His own Phelan loved fiddle music, after all"
Luck is fickle. Luck is fated. Luck is not real.,"I am one of the least luckiest people in the world. I am also one of the luckiest people in the world. How can that be? I had my business stolen from me. HUD did not pay for their tenants for seven months and I lost 43 rental units. My health deteriorated from there and my career as a professional auditor/scheduler went down hill. I lost my right ankle to zombie bacteria. Meaning my ankle died for 17 days and no one knew it and I was hurting and they finally cut it out of me. I was fired due to that experience. Went to work as soon as I could. I aint rich. And the first three jobs, all of them bad, were really bad. And? A few months later I lost my left foot. Luck is fated however. I went blind bloody shoot eyes. I could not afford Obamacare and to eat. After that, life went from bad to worse. If you have not slept for a few days you realize not sleeping for three months is wicked. I did not sleep, nor did I dream. I did, however, catch up on my television watching almost five years of HBO shows within two months. Having no foot. I was wheeled around and having poor to no eyesight. I went deaf for a time. Speaking of luck, you know I should have purchased a few lotto tickets.Seems like pretty unlucky? Now. Fate is real. From there I went to lose everything again. Moved in with my parent in law. And my deafness turned into something of a pain. Seems life would be almost over. I mean two stays in hospice. Being partially blind, deaf makes my life full and traveled a bit by traveling more highways than most. Just look me up on LinkedIn author, poet, filmmaker, scheduler for 80 plus projects, etc. So there I was. Then in 2016 plus or minus billions of years, depending on my mental state. I lost my mind, according to my wife.They call it Mandela effect. To lose 1.3 billion people from my world on Sagittarius arm which has 8.5 billion on 2016 to Orion nebula where you have 7,7 billion in 2021 five years difference makes me a bit a mental patient. So off to a shrink I was taken.Not such a good idea. You see. I have photos of my world. I ate at MacDonalds a Big Mac. I went shopping at JcPenny. I have photos. And? Well, my shrink told me I was living past lives. I told him as I am telling you-you are the ones dead. Not me. And how do I know this?Time. Time and luck.. Again I am lucky. I have lived through two hospice stays. And a dozen other death experiences. However, what convinced the doctor was some photos I showed him. Instead of demanding me to go to his clinic each week he had been demanding, he pilled me up and left me alone after my photo show to him.You say Clint you could have photoshopped those photos. I am partially blind and my writing is like my photos. As real as is it gets. So? Well, I am not traveling through parallel realities back in time. How? Called closed time curved loop reality. It is something. That is why I know you are dead. Why? Photos and history. If I lived on Sagittarius at 6.5 billion year old earth going to run into the galaxy in 365000 years. This reality earth states next galaxy to hit sometime in 4.5 billion years would mean I was older earth that saw your reality die a long time ago. Death is something. In a closed time curved loop reality I can talk with the dead.h And you are dead. And I?This is my last few minutes of my mind dying. And luck? I have learned from John Von Neumman when he lived to May 1957 on his last paper that there is no such thing as a chaos. Meaning? There is no such thing as luck. Fate is real. Everyones story is told and in reality fate being real and a story everything I did or am doing is already told. Just like Solomons statement in the bible states that everything under the sun has been done before. Meaning? Well, according to reality we are nothing more than stabilized light. Meaning? We are nothing more than avatars in some game that has a story line and you are to play out that storyline. But what if you want to be special? Good luck.. If fate has you being a blind one eyed deaf guy you might end up with me. Or if you do not believe yourself to be an avatar read The Secret of Light and realize you eat plant or plant basis foods and plants are made with light and thus allyou are is stabilized light. And choices given all you have is to choose right versus wrong there are no other words to state that nothing in life is lucky or unlucky everything is fated.Thus each of has a story line to live. Luck is not real. For there is no chaos. There is, however, a choice to make. Be good. Or end up elsewhere. Having lived in hell anr tell you do not want to go where I have been. Pray might be the only thing that can change reality. Thus speaks a pirate, poet, writer of parallel reality tales.Thus luck is not real. Chaos  is not real. And all we are is playing a game of life according to some absurd reality where I am not plundering you or writing some absurd poem about you.  You think I lie?  Look me up as a poet.  Understand acrostic poems and realize I use to be famous once upon a reality.  You think I am not a pirate?  Look me up as Ender the pirate. And realize we all have a story we used to live.  A writer?  I use to write on Myspace. Tina Tequila knew me.  On Facebook people remember me writing as Ender the pirate on some boards that no longer exist.  My tales of piracy were hated so much I was known as troll king..  And now?  Look up my interviews.  I might not be famous anymore.  But I seem to be noted by some people who are famous today.  And yesterday? Well, I lived and thought fate was unreal and lived to the fullest.  And luck?  Luck is a belief in chaos. I never believed in chaos. I believed in God.  How can that be true?  I am still dying here and you? You are figment of my imagination according to closed time curved loop math fomula. Can you change? I doubt it. I doubt your fate is sealed and i am just a soul telling you a tale. And if you do not repent and believe in Jesus. Well, there is an ending. And hell is real."
The tale of the cheese,"June 23was not by any means a special day, to everyone but the McKneelys. They would spend the day hiking through the woods to a specific spot in which they would burry a large wheel of cheese. It was important that they did this every year because It all started in the seventeen hundreds, on a dark night. The only sound to be heard were the quiet thunders in the distance, and the only light to be seen was the flashing lightning overhead. Great, great, great uncle Gulliver was in a deep sleep when all of a sudden- Donna stopped, hearing the doorbell. Ill be right back. She said, leaving her cousins in mystery. Opening the door, she saw her older brother, Devin with a large white box. Grabbing the box, Donna headed to the kitchen. ITS THE CHEESE! Donna yelled, calling all five of her cousins to meet them in the kitchen. Wow, no thanks? Devin asked sarcastically. They all crowded together around the table to admire the large wheel of cheese. Its sides were covered in golden brown layers and its center was a pretty pale yellow. Forged in the deepest pits of Switzerland, made just 50 years before great, great, great uncle Gulliver woke up that night, it was gruyere. Absolutely exquisite. Finish the story! Ella begged, she, the youngest of the McKneelys was the one who posed the question of why first. What story? Devin aske, settling in to the kitchen. Donna was telling us the completely wrong story of why we burry the cheese. Carly explained. Donna gasped dramatically, It is not! You didnt even let me finish! She complained. Oh by all means, finish the tale of great, great, great uncle Gulliver. Fitz mocked. Yeah, yeah, where was I? Oh right, so he was in a deep sleep when all of a sudden he heard a loud squeak. Now we all know that uncle Gulliver ran a bakery, that squeak indicated that a rat was present. Rats, the vermin of all food establishments. Gulliver knew what he had to do. He high tailed to the pharmacy across the street to get some rat poison, but seeing as he showed up covered in rain water, he wouldnt be taken seriously. Donna said mischievously, earning multiple eye rolls. By the time he came back, he could see the rats. It was happening all too quickly, he rushed off to the cheese shop which had not been infected with the rat plague. He arrive and ordered the largest, most exquisite cheese they had ever made, the gruyere. It was beautiful. At that time they had painted the edges purple, to mark the highest quality. Uncle Gulliver had concocted a plan, a plan to get rid of all the rats that were taking over the bakery. He marched far off into the deep dark woods on the outskirts of town. Donna said, building up suspense, now allowing the cousins to become interested.A trail of rats followed him all the way from the bakery, one by one in a neat line. Oh what a spectacle it was, the towns people talked about it for weeks after. Soon though, Gulliver reached a deep hole in the ground, of which he threw the wheel of cheese into, thus allowing the rats to follow in pursuit. Once all the rats had disappeared down the hole, Gulliver made quick work and covered up the hole, thus trapping the rats in there forever and ridding the town of the plague. Donna finished with a toothy grin. Well that was utter nonsense. Mayura muttered to herself. And I suppose you have a better theory? Donna asked, her voice clearly laced with distain. I do in fact. Mayura smirked proudly. Well go on then, lets hear it. Fitz asked, now fully interested. Once more, the cousins found themselves on the couches listening to another story of their strange tradition. There was once a small patch of red and white mushrooms along the horizon. It was inhabited by fairies. Thousands of tiny little fairies. And they were ruled by the gracious Queen Tatiana, a glorious fairy who loved each of her subjects with all of her heart. They lived peacefully for hundreds of years before the attacks started, the attacks of the cat. Mayura started before she was interrupted. The cat? Carly asked skeptically. Yes, the cat! A ferocious being that wreaked havoc amongst the fairies. Queen Tatiana searched far and wide, high and low to be able to find a solution to this horrid menace. Soon enough, after months of searching, she ran into a witch. Mayura continued before once again being interrupted. Theres a witch now? Devin asked, matching Carlys skeptic tone. Do you want me to finish the story or not? Mayura snapped. Sorry, sorry. Please finish! Ella begged dramatically. Mayura rolled her eyes but continued her story anyways. So the witch told her that she needed a solid form of dairy that she could use to word off the evil spirits within the cat. So they formed a team of military chefs to try and make the solid form of dairy. It took them precisely three weeks, five days and two hours to invent cheese. It was a perfect solution with only one problem, that being the solid form of dairy was too large and heavy for even the strongest fairies to transport. So Queen Tatiana decided to do something shed never done before, trust a human! Mayura declared. Of course. Donna muttered under her breath earning a glare from Mayura. So Queen Tatiana herself, secretly ventured into the human village where she met our ancestors and tasked them with the power of diminishing the spirit of the cat. And since then, our family has helped Queen Tatiana and all of the fairies stay safe from the tyranny of the cat. Mayura finished. Little cousin, sorry to tell you. But youre once again wrong. Fitz smirked. Let me guess, youre the only one who knows the actual story? Ella asked, her voice clearly laced with sarcasm. Before Fitz could answer, Devin and Donnas parents walked in. Good, everyones here already. Their mom said, heading to the kitchen. We can leave right now then. Their dad said, motioning all of them to follow him to the minivan. Its my turn to tell the story! Fitz complained as they piled in the large vehicle. No ones stopping you. Carly said sassily. Fitz gave her a tight smile before starting his story. It actually started in the industrial era, during the Ozhiphen war. Our many ancestors worked in the special forces in the army and usually dealt with cases of espionage. Fitz started, as both parents entered the car and the journey began. Grandma Casoria was in that unit, in fact, she was second in command, with Grandpa being not so far down the ranks. Fitz mentioned as he wiggled his eyebrows. The other side was closing in on us, and the first in command had no clue on what to do. So grandma took it upon herself to figure it out. The other side was much more capable than us, and they had plenty more weapons. But they had signed a contract stating that they wouldnt harm anyone who wasnt directly involved in the conflict, meaning citizens. Fitz said seriously. So as skeevy as it was, grandma Casoria used this to her advantage. She left the military and went straight to the cheese shop, not bothering to change out of her uniform, she bought a huge wheel of cheese. She wandered into no-mans-land and started to dig a hole, large and deep, in which she would put the cheese in. Fitz said, now getting interrupted by Ella. Who signs a contract that wouldnt benefit them? She wondered with serious thought, but keeping quiet after she received a death glare from Fitz. She did obviously get caught, and unfortunately was shot. However, thats exactly what grandma Casoria wanted. She did eventually recover from the wound and get the proper treatment. But because of her brave actions, the other side was reprimanded and left defenseless for a time at which was used to our advantage. Thats is how we won the war, although, grandma Casoria never received a reward for her brave actions. We, the McKneelys burry a wheel of cheese every year in honor of her brave sacrifice. Fitz smiled victoriously. Thats even worse! Donna yelled. Yeah? Well at least its better than your stupid rat thing! Fitz countered. They were both stupid! Mayura cut in. Not as ridiculous as your fairy nonsense! Both Fitz and Donna blurted out at the same time. KIDS! Donna and Devins mom yelled from the front seat. What is the issue? She asked angrily. Theyre arguing about why we burry cheese. Carly stated nonchalantly. Donna and Devins dad burst out in laughter, while their mom had a ghost of a smile on her lips. It was all because of a bet. Their dad said in between laughs. A BET? Each cousin asked at the same time, obviously confused. Yes, your grandfather, my father, made a bet with his coworker just before Devin was born. It was about something stupid, Im sure, but my father was so convinced he was right that he bet thirty percent of each of your collage funds. Their mom explained. He was wrong of course. So as a compromise, every year, we have to burry the cheese in the forest so that we can hold on to your collage funds. It really is a small price to pay. She shrugged, leaving all of the kids stunned. I like the fairy thing better. Ella squeaked, resulting in a loud fit of laughter. It was a good June 23for the McKneely family."
A Single mistake,"A SINGLE MISTAKE-Chanda JhaOnce upon a time there was a man, aged about 26 years, around 6 feet tall and thin with long black hair and beard, also had a sharp eyes, signed on a register and came out from police station. As soon as he reached in a society, he heard some sound against him like why do he come here?, he has already harm the respect of our society now he might harm us and our family, we should talk to the secretary to take him out from the society.Ignoring such voices he moved to his door and opened it. He found his rented flat looks same as he left with, but the room and hall are little dusty. He cleaned the room and hall and went to take bath. Then he cooked food and ate. Then he went to his bed to sleep. But he was unable to sleep because of his unfortunate past and he started thinking about his past.He was living with parents in his flat happily. He had his best friend Harish, Shreyash and Harish were childhood friend and classmates. Both were very smart and intelligent. But Harish was a toper of his school where as Shreyash was an average student. Shreyash wanted to be toper of his class. He tried his best and studied hard, even his good luck was not with him and he failed. Harish always tried to motivate him for his hard work. When they were appearing for their board exam, due to his much hard study he got first rank in board examination. He was very happy for his success. After getting result he went to his home and decided to go out for dinner with his parents and his best friend at night to celebrate same moment. He invited his best friend Harish to join. But Harish refused his invitation saying that as he had also scored second rank in the school, his parents were also celebrating in the same night. Thus, they both decided to celebrate with each other on very next day.Shreyash went with his parents in a restaurant, where they ordered different types of food. In the middle of their dinner Shreyash got a call by Harish and came to know that Harish met with a car accident and now he is admitted to the city hospital. Shreyash became nervous and without completing his dinner move alone to visit Harish. He was in very much hurry; he drove his car very fast. Suddenly, a lady came in front of his car and she died and Shreyash arrested by police on same moment.The court gave judgement against Shreyash and he was punished for ten years imprisonment. As his father loved him so much, he wasnt able to recover from such incident and after two months of his arrest he died. Somehow, he came to know about this sad news. His mother was unable to tolerate the filthy languages of her neighbours against her innocent son and left the society without informing anyone.Due to his good behaviour he was realised within eight years. Suddenly he falls asleep in midnight. On very next day of being realised, in the morning he got up at 7:00 am. He knew that his neighbours were looking him as criminal just because he had come from jail. Even he got up cut his hair and beard, took bath and came down in the ground of his society, where he found a 3 to 4 years child was crying, he took up the child and brought a chocolate from nearest shop, at that time only the mother of the child came there and take the child back from Shreyash and threw the chocolate on dustbin. Child again started crying and said his mother You are bad mother, you throw my chocolate and uncle is good man. Even his mother got inside with her child. Then Shreyash moved for Harish home, where he saw that Harish had become a respected doctor, got married a beautiful lady and had a cute six month little boy. Harish saw Shreyash and became very happy to see him. They both hug each other. Harish said that he missed him very much in last eight years. Then Shreyash asked Harish to find out her mother. They both from that time only started to found his mother but failed.One day when Shreyash was cleaning his hall room, he found a letter, in which her mother wrote the situations that she had faced and also an address was written there in the letter where his mother was staying. Then he went to meet his mother and took her at their flat.Day by day they were recovering from the past events and due to their nice behaviour their neighbouring relations were became good. But, as Shreyash was recorded as criminal, he was not eligible to join government job as well to be a trustable person for the society. Then Harish offered Shreyash to run his family livelihood, but he refused to take his help and he started searching for job.One day he was going in search of job. Suddenly a car passed through him. The break of that car was failed and a girl was inside the car. Then the car impinged with a tree and stopped. The lady, who was inside the car, became faint. He took the lady in to hospital and saved her life. Then he returned to his home without getting job.ON the very next day that lady came at his room with her father, who was a successful businessman of the city. He offered Shreyash job and thanked him for saving his daughters life. Thus Shreyash and Shretha came in contact and started met with each other. Day by day the friendship changed into love relationship and one day Shretha asked Shreyash for date, where Shreyash proposed Shretha for marriage. They both got married happily with the permission of their parents. After two years, they had a little baby girl. Thus, Shreyash won on his bad luck and grabbed the various opportunities and with his hard work and patience he changed his luck as well as recovered from his bad situations."

So, lets read an origin story, a story which is filled with every emotion and must be read by the one who thinks that he has lost in the race of life.Prithvi, a 20 year old village lad was standing between two roads which were created in his mind. He was recently fired from his job because of financial issues. His father had worked hard to install all machines and set-up the factory but his arrogant uncle used to scream and tease Prithvis father that he was illiterate. Prithvi got agitated one day and screamed at his uncle. Due to this, both of them were fired. While closing the doors of the office, his uncle had said that his father had to polish his shoes in front of everyone. Then only they would be appointed in the factory that too at the lowest position which is sweeping. Prithvis father was shocked due to this event and became a patient to mental disorder. The doctor had asked both of them to stay in the town until the treatment was over. The main problem which Prithvi faced was that there was not much money in the house to complete the full treatment. Who would help him to treat his father? His uncle, who was his only relative had betrayed and left him. The roads which he saw in front of him were to stay with his father and polish his uncles shoe to earn money or to leave his father behind and go to a new village to work. Prithvi did not have any friends left now. The ones he had were working in his uncles factory and they were prohibited to meet him. His sister had run away to her lovers house. Her lover was still unknown. So he knew that his real elder sister, who had taken care of him in the absence of his mother, would also not help him because she knew that Prithvis father would not allow her shadow to fall inside the house. He ran home crying, and asked his father a question.Pa, my mind has created two roads. Two different roads and both are tough. Which one should I tread upon?As his father was mentally disturbed, he talked childish things.Son, you run on the divider and watch both of these roads.What rubbis- Thank you pa Prithvi said and went into the kitchen to cook food. His father had turned on the TV and had started watching cartoons. Prithvi served the dinner to his father and asked another question.Pa, can I make a new road out of the dividerYes, it will be difficult. People will scold you for removing the divider but they will be happy when the third road is constructed. Most of the accidents happen on the dividerOk pa. Thank you for your advice. I will surely construct the third road and cure youPrithvi washed the plates and sat on the terrace steps, looking at the stars and finding his mother. Mrs. Shubhangi was a patient to last stage of cancer and had passed away after giving birth to Prithvi. Tears had filled his eyes. He did not even remember touching her skin, sleeping on her lap, doing mischief with her. There was no time for these events to commence. He reminisced the days when he used to ask his father that where was his mother. His father used to distract him by showing him chocolates. Now he was determined to construct a road with the help of the divider. The next day, he counted all his worldly wealth, bought loans and left to create a new chapter in the books of struggle. He bought a small plot beside his uncles factory in which he started farming. He domesticated cows which roamed on the streets and started selling vegetables and milk. He used to get up at 3:30 AM in the morning and walked throughout the village to sell milk. As his job was going good, he hired a vegetable-cum-milk seller and started distributing life insurance policies across the village. He started to earn more money. Then, he started selling cows at high rate. He earned more money. Hereafter, he sold half of his plot to a wealthy builder and asked him to construct a factory in return for him in the remaining plot. He hired few transgender people from the village, understanding their problem and started working in the factory. Slowly his factory upgraded and the day of triumph arrived when he became more successful than his uncle. He looked for a foreign doctor who cured mental disorders and healed his dad. His dad also started working in the same factory. Both of them yielded profit from the factory, invested in stock markets and accumulated great wealth. At this point, he started repaying the debts. He also bought a new house, bigger and spacious than his uncle.After five years, Prithvi and his father were planning to open a new branch of their office Shubhangi Pvt. Ltd. His uncle entered the factory. He came near Prithvi and his dad and started polishing their shoes. One action speaks millions of words. The rest I leave upon youThis was the story of a 20 year old boy who showed the world that anything is possible even if you dont have wealth. You might be thinking about the divider, the first and the second road. Let me clear this issue. As you remember, that one road was to leave his father behind and go to a new village while the other was to polish his uncles shoe and get employed in his uncles factory in the same village. The divider is a path which is a mixture of both. The divider road said to work in a new factory but in the same village.P.S. - Thank you Reedsy for providing me such a good platform to express my thoughts. Thank you so much!"
A man and Evil and his luck,"There was once a very talented craftsman who was hired to build a small church in a small village. The man was given a month to complete his task and he assured the people of the village that he would do as he had promised and build them a beautiful church that would make them all very proud.The craftsman asked the people of the village to give him his wages before he began his work so that he might buy food and materials. The kind people of the village trusted the craftsman and so they paid him his money and believed that he would do as he had promised.But the craftsman did not begin work straightaway; instead he used the money to gamble and to buy wine. He often slept late into the afternoons and rarely felt like working in the hot sunshine. And so, before he knew what had happened, the whole month had passed and only a few bricks had been laid in the ground.The craftsman grew very nervous when he realised that he only had one last night to complete the church. He knew that it would not be possible to finish the task in such a short time and he was sure that the villagers would be very angry and would demand that he repay the money they had given him. And so the desperate craftsman decided to make a deal with the devil.Please, oh devil, said the craftsman on bended knees, make this church for me in just one night so that the villagers do not punish me.The devil appeared in a puff of black smoke and said to the craftsman, I shall build this church for you in a single night, but in exchange for my work you must promise me your soul.I promise you my soul, said the reluctant craftsman, but the church must be completed by dawn and it must be absolutely perfect in every detail or our deal will not stand and you will not get my soul.The devil agreed, and in no time at all he called his workers from the flames and set them to building the church.The craftsman sat and watched with a heavy heart as the devil and his workers went about building the floor and the walls and the roof of the church. The poor man grew more and more nervous as dawn approached because it seemed certain that the devil would indeed have the church completed by dawn and that it would be perfect in every detail.As the dark sky turned to a pale blue, the craftsman began to pray to god because he very much regretted promising his soul to the devil.I could have built this church myself, mused the poor man. I am talented and I am strong and I can work hard. Why did I not begin the work when I promised I would? And now I am to lose my soul.The craftsman prayed and prayed that the devil might not complete the work or that the church might not be perfect so that the deal would be broken. But as the sun appeared on the distant horizon the poor man was sure that his prayers had gone unanswered.Then the devil stepped out from the church and invited the craftsman to inspect his work. It is dawn and I have done as you asked, said the devil. Now your soul is mine and you must follow me into the flames for eternity.The poor craftsman looked all about the outside of the church but could see no mistakes whatsoever. Then he walked inside the church and desperately began inspecting the devils work in the hope that he might find something wrong. But inside, just as outside, he could find no fault at all.Just as it seemed that his fate was well and truly sealed, the craftsman noticed a tiny ray of sunlight creeping across the stone floor of the church. He followed the sunlight across the floor and there, at the foot of the far wall, he found that a single brick was missing.You have missed a brick just here! exclaimed the craftsman. My prayers have been answered for you have not completed the work in every detail and so our deal no longer stands and you will not get my soul!The devil could not understand how he had made such a mistake. He was very, very angry but he could not argue that there was indeed a brick missing from the wall. And just as the sun rose up into the sky, and the excited villagers began to gather at the door to the church, the devil disappeared in a puff of angry black smoke.Before the craftsman went out to greet the villagers he decided that he would try to put a brick in the hole so that the church would be perfect in every detail. But when he placed the brick in the hole the church began to rumble and rattle and shake, and so he removed the brick and decided that this hole would remain there forever as a reminder of how close he had come to losing his soul.I shall never again make a promise that I am not prepared to keep, thought the craftsman as he walked out of the church. I shall be committed to my work and I shall always keep my word.The villagers were all delighted with their new church, and the priest too was very pleased when he saw the work. From that day forwards, the little church was always full of people and the craftsman visited often in order to remind himself of his promise.And do you know that little church still stands today? And if you ever visit you must walk to the far wall and there you will find a hole where a single brick is missing, and where, every dawn, a tiny ray of sunlight creeps across the floor and serves as a reminder to us all that we must always keep our promises and complete the tasks we say we will complete."
The Tale of Princess Lark Adalyn Poverly,"Once upon a time, on a day brighter than any other, a girl whose name was Princess Lark Adalyn Poverly was born. She was the pride and joy of her parents Queen Eloise Gwyneth Poverly and King Raynor Thornston Poverly. They were the rulers of the kingdom of Alondia. For years, Lady Eloise was told she would never have children, so it was a surprise to everyone when Princess Lark was born. As a heads up, I want to warn you. If you think this is a story where everyone lives happily ever after, nobody dies, and no tragic incidents happen to main character, you are mistaken. This is quite a catastrophic, true story of a girl who has the worst of luck. In Alondia, each newborn royal is to have a christening three weeks after they are born. So, instead of calling her Lark, they had always called her the princess. A week before the christening, Queen Eloise took ill. She steadily worsened until two days before, she died.  Her last words to her ever faithful husband were, Raynor, do not cry, do not mourn. I am going to a far better place, where laughter and joy are abundant, and where sickness and pain are no more. Hold fast to that faith. To the faith of Yahweh, our Savior. Teach our daughter, and remember that I am always with you. I only have one other request. The day I heard that I was to have a baby, a lark flew through my window and landed on the bedpost, singing a song that was so beautiful that I cried. Because of that, I want you to name our daughter Lark. Even though the Queen had died, the kingdom chose to listen to her and did not mourn but rejoiced for their beloved Queen was with the Lord. On the day of the Christening, royals and peasants alike visited the castle to pay their respects to the new Princess. The king had also invited every fairy leader so they main bestow gifts upon Lark. All but one. As the guests arrived, an orchestra was playing and everyone was having a great time. The fairies began to give gifts to the child. The Fey leader of the Kingdom of Silven was first. Queen Arthora stepped forward and laughed. This baby is pathetically bald! The gift I will bestow is that she will have long, golden blonde hair that will never have to be brushed. Queen Denera of Vestica gave the gift of weaponry, to the kings horror. King Yevoor of Wanark gave the gift of disguise. Lastly Queen Velyrika of Tairyia bestowed the gift of song because she too loved the song of a lark. Suddenly right after Queen Velyrika had spoken the word song, howls filled the air and a chill spread over the castle. The Great Hall doors were flung open wide as a young woman burst in, dressed in sweeping silver robes, with two identical white wolves by her side. King Raynor stood his ground, though a look of fear entered his eyes. Unsheathing his sword, he stepped in front of Princess Larks cradle and in a commanding voice he asked What do you want Iduna? The young woman laughed and flicked a finger, sending King Raynor flying across the Hall.  Regaining her composure, she sent a steely gaze over the people in the room. What I want is to know why I wasnt invited to my nieces christening? Or are you still afraid of me because of what happened to Nikolai? Fear entered the Alondian villagers eyes. Iduna smiled. ""Oh yes, that's what it is. Just because I erased the memory of your Prince Nikolai, you think that you have a right to shun me and banish me to the East! You have NO right! Most of you were not there when this unfortunate event took place. Your King most likely twisted the tale, making me look like the monster everyone says I am. It started on a day like this. A christening for a young prince. I was so honored King Raynor chose me to give a gift to Nikolai. The gift I intended to give him was memory.  We had done it outside in the sunshine, and while I was in the process of giving the gift, a Roc flew in and tried to snatch Nikolai from his cradle. I had just spoken the words,""I will give you the gift of-"" when it flew in. I shouted ""No!"" and then the guards took the Roc down with a crossbow. I finished the rites by saying ""-memory"", and then realized my mistake. I had given my precious nephew the gift of no memory. Since then, everyone has nicknamed me, ""Iduna, Wicked Queen of the East."" Because you have not forgiven me no matter how many times I have tried, I will give you a slight At this, she smiled wickedly at Princess Lark, laying helplessly in her cradle. ""Dearest little niece... I bestow upon you the gift of Wandering. Once you leave your home for the first time, you may never return again.  Seventeen years later...  Princess Lark Poverly awoke to the sound of birds chirping in her window. The familiar longing to leave the castle grounds settled in her stomach once again, as it had everyday. Lark stood and glanced out her bedroom window. Outside of the carefully manicured palace gates was a wild, unruly forest, filled with crystal lakes and breathtaking mountains. The pull to leave increased. Slipping in riding clothes, she reached under her bed and grabbed her crossbow.  Secretly saddling her horse, Maris, she took off towards the gates. Her best friend Evangeline had shown her a secret path that was big enough for a horse that led out of the gates. Turning sharply she led her horse to a patch of ivy. Pushing it aside she urged Maris forward and through the tunnel. Emerging, the longing dissipated and she felt an uneasy knot enter instead. Turning around, she felt guilty for betraying her fathers wishes to keep her inside the kingdom. She tried to go back through, but it was as if an invisible wall had slammed into her way. Swinging back atop Maris, she urged her to enter the forest.  Traveling for aboutthree hours, she came to a beautiful clearing, and to her right was a lake, where three rivers met. Tying Maris to a low hanging branch, she glanced around and tried to get familiar with her surroundings. A noise came from her left and Lark snatched up her crossbow. Lighting quick she loaded it and aimed for the noise. Out of the woods came a black buck, with huge, towering racks. Lark aimed her arrow at the heart of the buck. The buck stepped forward, and to her surprise it spoke. ""My fair lady! I am a humble traveler, and I am inquiring if you could help me on my journey. You see, I am Prince Griffith-"" Lark loosed her arrow driving it straight into his heart. ""That was not very nice."" He said, looking down at the arrow protruding from his furry chest.  To Lark's surprise, the buck disintegrated into fine dust and blew away. In its place stood a handsome young man. She gasped and dove behind a bush. The man laughed, ""You know that really hurt, but what I should be saying is thank you. So, thanks."" Lark peeked her head up and cautiously walked into view. ""Who are you?"" She asked, her face wary. ""I should be saying the same, but I am Crown Prince Griffith Peregrine of Kaeridien, Kingdom of the North. I was cursed when I was fifteen when I rejected a marriage proposal to the daughter of a powerful Fey. Have you heard of Iduna, Wicked Fey Queen of the East?"" He asked with a lopsided grin. ""I have heard of her. She is my aunt. Also, my name is Princess Lark Poverly of Alondia."" Griffith stared at her, shocked. ""I am sorry I said all of those terrible things about her. I had no idea."" ""It's fine! When I was a baby, she came to my christening uninvited and cursed me for my fathers unforgivness. She gave me the gift of Wandering, so that if I left home I wouldn't be able to return. All of my life, I have felt a pull towards the outer kingdoms. Let's just say that I just figured all of that out by sneaking out four hours ago."" She smiled sheepishly. Griffith looked surprised. ""well, maybe you could go back to my castle... I haven't been back since I was fifteen because my father is a fierce hunter and probably would have killed me.""  So off they went towards Kaeridien, traveling many days and becoming fast friends. After a while, when they were nearing his home, Griffith stopped. He unsheathed his sword and told Lark to get behind him. Lark obeyed and carefully removed her crossbow from her back. Both in battle stance, they aimed their weapons at the noise of hoofbeats and someone on foot crashing through the branches. ""Lark, when the man comes into view, I want you to shoot him in the leg."" She nodded. The man came into view first, running as fast as he could with a satchel hanging on one shoulder. Lark loosed an arrow and caught him, the head finding its mark, while Prince Griffith distracted the guards chasing him. Turns out he knew them all by name. While Kaeridien Captain's back was turned, Lark dragged the thief behind Maris. ""Captain Isidore! How goes everything back home?"" The hardy captain took one look at his assumed dead prince, and fell off his horse in a dead faint. He awoke thirty minutes later to the smell of a roasted pheasant over a crackling fire. He glanced around the camp and saw not only Prince Griffith, but Princess Lark, his brothers Princess. ""You are Princess Lark correct? You might know my brother, Captain Flynn."" Larks eyes lit up. ""I do! He is always watching out for me and making sure I don't leave the palace gates..."" Glancing down she trailed off, guilt entering her for the second time.  Captain Isidore patted her shoulder. ""It's not your fault you were cursed. Now, I'm famished! You got anything to eat?"" Suddenly, his head snapped up, jumped to his feet, and tackled a shadowy figure. ""No!"" Lark shouted. ""He's harmless!"" Isidore scoffed. ""Nikolai Nottingham? Doubtful. He has plagued these parts for twelve years."" ""Wait."" Lark's eyes widened. ""Did you say, Nikolai?"" She stood and glided over to where he was pinned. ""Nikolai... You look exactly like my father."" It hit her. ""Nikolai! You're alive!"" She hugged him as hard as she could. Nikolai looked to Isidore, his eyes pleading for help. ""I'm sorry."" He started. ""But I have no idea who you are."" ""Right!"" Lark exclaimed. ""Our aunt, Iduna, Wicked Fey Queen of the East, accidentally gave you the gift of no memory. You are the son of King Raynor and Queen Eloise Poverly. You are my older brother."" He gasped and clutched his head. He shouted, ""I remember! For once in my life I remember!"" Just like that, the spell was broken, and Crown Prince Nikolai Nottingham Poverly was free. With the help of Lark's new friend, they helped Nikolai to the castle and did everything they could to heal him as quick as possible.  Three Months Later...  Princess Lark rushed down the hallway to Griffith's chambers in Aregonn Castle. Pounding on the door, it was flung open and Griffith stood in the doorway. Lark ran through the door and hugged him. ""Griff! I was in the forest surrounding the castle and-"" ""Lark slow down!"" He laughed. ""-I saw Iduna."" The grin slid off his face in an instant. "" Stay here, I will go and take care of her."" ""Absolutely not! I need you to come with me and we can finish her together."" Griff sighed. ""Well, I can see on your face that my attempts to persuade you will be pointless. Fine."" Lark grabbed his hand and dragged him out the doors, Griffith trying to attach his sword all the while. She stopped the edge of a river about a mile south. On the other side, Griffith glimpsed Iduna, the woman who ruined the childhoods of both of them.  Drawing his sword, he grabbed a vine hanging above them, pulled Lark into his arms, and swung across. Once across, Griffith charged Iduna, and managed to get within four feet, until she flicked her wrist and he went sprawling into a tree. Anger burning in her chest, Lark snuck up on Iduna in a tree, and dropping on her head, laying her flat. Lark heard a pop and looked down. Iduna's arm was at an unnatural angle. Lark sprung off her chest, knife in hand, ready to finish the woman who had caused her pain, but stopped. She dropped the knife and said in a loud, clear voice. ""I will grant you mercy. In the Bible, Jesus says to love our enemies. I do not hate you and never have, but you must pay for the harm you have caused to many people."" Iduna snarled. "" I don't need your petty words of love and forgiveness. I want my revenge!"" With a roar, she sprung from the ground and with her good hand, snatched the knife from the ground and dove for Lark. She had forgotten about Griffith, unfortunately, and payed severely for her mistake. Griffith had run up behind her and struck her on the head with the hilt of his sword. The Wicked Queen collapsed to the ground, unconscious. Griff whistled and Isidore, Nikolai, and three more guards emerged from the woods on horseback. Tying her wrists together, they slung Iduna across one of the horses and brought her back to the Aregonn dungeons. Thankfully, Captain Isidore promised that she would stay there for eighteen years.  Lark looked at Griffith, suddenly shy, and whispered, ""Thank you for saving me. It scared me so much when you smacked into that tree, I thought you were gone."" A dry sob escaped her throat. Griffith enveloped her in a hug and kissed her forehead. ""All is well, All is well."" Griffith unexpectedly dropped to one knee and took Lark's hand. ""Princess Lark Adalyn Poverly of Alondia, will you marry me?"" She gasped, ""Yes!""  So they were married and in the years to come, their eleven children were also happily married, of course not without troubles. Iduna escaped after five years and troubled the people once again, but that's a story for another time."
WOMB,"The dumb spiders were crying in a dilapidated house. Suddenly, the raindrops with the heavy wind were alike fighting with the earth.

Car was in the journey carrying the minds that couldnt bear the separation of the friend.  The reticence is the lenitive music in the car.  `Arun...  Joseph, what? Ask me without hesitation  Dont mistake me.' Hey, when did I have mistaken you?  Again, I tell you to ask me without hesitation.  Kumar's ears also were ready to listen.  Do you believe the ghost, devil, and spirit?  Why do you ask this?  First, you tell me then Ill explain you.  Dude, devil, and ghosts are unreal matters. Those are many peoples illusion and hallucinations that are all.  Arun, Basith didnt hang himself'. Kumar stopped the car suddenly. 'Arun, what does he mean now? Joseph What happened to you? Even we haven't drink now. Then why are blabbering? ' Kumar, Don't get angry! Just listen to him. You just drive the car. No... Kumar agreed to Arun's words. 'Joseph, tell us whatever you think' 'Arun, I mean....' When he started to say he got shivering Arun touched his shoulders. 'Hey, I am with you tell me boldly 'When we entered Basith's room, I saw a doll there.' 'What do you mean a doll in Basith's room? I'll believe if you say that there was a girl in his room, doll... clod... Don't relate Alibaba story. ' 'Kumar, don't interact, first listen to him what he is going to say. Okay 'Arun, okay. I won't talk any more. Now tell us. 'I looked closely that doll... there ... there... ( Arun hold up his shoulders) My name was written in blood. I asked Basith's mother about that doll, she asked me which doll. When I turn to show her, the doll was not there. ' 'So that ghost is going to kill you too.' (Kumar again interacted)'It's okay if it kills me, but... After we buried Basith's body, I saw Kumar's name in that Meezan stone... 'Why are you crying? ' 'Kumar's name was written there.' Again the reticence was the music in that car. 'Kumar... last month.... that dilapidated house, we raped a girl (continued with no end) 'Yeah... what's for that? ' When we were with her, she was dead, not only that, now she is looking at both of you.' The value of death showed fear in the eyes. When Arun's eyes looked at Kumar, the death of Basith has appeared like a short film behind the backside of him. Kumar laughed ghastly in the front seat. Kumar, what happened da....? 'Hey.... sinners... I am not Kumar. Somehow I am also your partner. I am that chaste woman's husband. Her spirit killed me first, later Basith, then Kumar... 'What are you blabbering? ' 'Yes, your friend is no more... 'Have you drunken? (Again that drastic laugh) 'Now your Joseph is going to die without knowing this ...' The car door of the seat side where Arun seated, was opened and threw him,  Arun couldn't get up from there. He was floundering because of the strong contuse in his chest; the car was burned in a fire. The car crashed at the rock. Science world was watching Arun surprisingly Arun departed from his friends and now living isolated, he was given a penalty that had never given to anybody there before by God. Now, Arun is three months pregnant, because of the curse of a chaste woman. The eon admired about him. After losing his relations and properties he realized what is really a life... He was rejected without a dwelling, now his luxurious mansion and palace is that dilapidated house where they tasted the dead body of the chaste woman... Day by day his stomach has grown big in size. Even he couldn't commit suicide, his thoughts and activities were tied by the curses of a chaste woman... 'Oh, chaste! Please kill me! I could bear this no more.' He begs for his death, suffered more than a hundred thousand times thinking his fault. The chaste woman arose before his eyes. She carried a doll also. When he saw her, he melted like a candle... 'Anna (brother) please doesnt weep  The heart does its work  A spurt of tear overflowing as the sea.  'I am a sinner, who destroyed you, but still, you call me as your brother...' 'Anna...! God has given the punishment rather than your sin.' 'Yes completed three months today. After seven months will I get free?' 'No.....' Arun was frozen with eerie. She related continuously. 'Medical world says that you are conceived now, that's not true. According to fate, you should have died in that car accident, but god will increase the shape of the womb till the end of an eon.' He didn't know to reply to the words of chaste woman, he measured the answer by eyes. 'Hereafter, it is the retribution to men, who destroy the women not only that, all of your friends will join with you in the vault of heaven.' 'The reserved time from God for me isover  A chaste woman disappeared like dew, leaped up in the flower. Arun's heart accepted the penalty as penance, realizing the mindset of a woman entirely. Time passed ten o'clock, usually, the road seems crowded, and today its depleted. After the college, Arun's sister Nithya was going home, in the rain as she couldn't get the bus. Her wetted dress showed her body parts as beautiful paintings. Whilst, Varun and his three friends bowed down heads, which had come in bail and was arrested in the rape case. Nithya crossed that place with afraid of her chastity, as she has seen their faces, viral in newspaper and televisions.  Today, Varun and his friends are one month pregnant, because of the help for someone's sin."
The Serpent and The Dragon,"The river wound, twisting and turning through the shallow valley. The melancholy humm of the stream sounded out, bouncing off of the mountainside.Tall grass grew rampant, spread across the lands along with fern and flowers, and rabbits and bunnies hid amongst the shrubbery.Amidst the chaos, there was a girl. She was young, but not too young. She was in her twenties. She wore a red kimono, embellished with flowy pink ribbons and a black obijime, and her hair was held up in a neatly tied bun. She was waiting. For what, it was hard to tell.The girl sat with her legs like a mermaid's tail, silent and still that any passerby may think she we're a statue. Even her breathing was shallow enough to go unnoticeable. A gust of wind blew through the valley, threatening to undo her bun before it settled down. A large, flying creature could be seen overhead, twisting and turning like the river.It was red, and scaly, and huge. It lumbered down towards the girl, who didn't move an inch. ""You're late."", she said. The dragon only huffed in response.For the first time in what seemed like forever, the girl moved, gracefully swooping herself up and clambering onto the dragon's back.Without hesitating, the dragon rose into the air, and they were off. The dragon twisted along with the river, following its set path. They wound over a small set of trees, big enough to be called a tiny forest, and traversed across endless plains in between mountains.They hovered over a small town, and people gawked and stared and pointed at the dragon and the girl, in awe at the sight.Finally, the dragon began to slow. It stayed floating above a patch of land, right where the river met the ocean. ""Are you ready?"", the dragon asked, speaking for the first time in this narrative.""I'm ready."", the girl responded.Without another word, the dragon drew lower and closer to the ocean, and the girl leaped from the dragon's head and into the water.She crashed with a splash, landing against the cool surface.For a minute, nothing happened, and the dragon awaited silently.A splash in the water, and the girl had transformed. She was no longer a human girl, but a serpent.She lifted her tail out of the water, bringing it down which resulted in a large gush of water.The dragon laughed merrily. ""Well done."", the dragon said. ""Well done indeed."" The serpent made a noise like a dolphin; a high pitched, laugh- like squeal. ""Thank you."", the serpent said, head out of water, and the dragon only nodded.""Shall we go?"" Another nod. The serpent and the dragon traversed the oceans, one by sky, the other by seas. They traveled far, far enough so that the little valley they had come from became but a speck on the horizon, and still, they travel farther than that.They journeyed through seas and storms, traversed through depths and highs. They traveled cities and unfound land, until they reached another valley, with yet another winding river a mirror of the one they had come from. Only because it was the same one. But in another form.Somewhere amidst their travels, they had crossed plains. The serpent reached the shore, and with a leap, transformed back into the girl. She landed gracefully on the beach, and the dragon stayed hovering in the air. The dragon could not transform, for he did not wish he could, unlike the girl, who did.The dragon lowered so that the girl may climb upon his back, and off they went.At some point along the winding river, the girl got off, and the dragon left. The nameless girl sat with her legs like a mermaid's tail upon the grass, and waited. For what, it was no longer that hard to tell. Hours later, there was a gust of wind, and the dragon re- appeared. ""You're late."", the girl said. The dragon only huffed in response.And so, the cycle continues. ----- Somewhere, in the midst of Kyoto, a young girl with straight black hair tied up into a ponytail sits, scouring the lines of a familiar book.""The Serpent and and The Dragon"", the title reads. She reads and re- reads every single page, making sure to catch every detail and missing nothing.Her room is dark, but there is a light on her night stand that gives a good view for traveling eyes, and her window is open, letting in the light of the full moon.She is having a pleasant time reading, flipping through each page delicately.From the downstairs, her mother calls. ""Hanako dear, it's time for dinner!"", she says.""I'm coming mom!"", the girl calls back. She re- reads one last sentence before placing the book on her bed stand, saving it for later that night when she would have the time to read it once more, and scurries down to dinner.The smell of baked sushi and cinnamon wafts from the kitchen through the staircase, and the girl smiles.She takes her seat at the dining room table along with her mom, her dad, obaachan and ojchan.They eat silently, disrupted only but often whispers from her obaachan to her ojchan, but her mother tries to keep up the conversation by breaking in the latest news she saw on the television.They eat dumplings and baked sushi, and talk about the weather and about a recent bank robbery near their house and obaachan scolds Hanako's dad for having a 'bad security' in their household.Hanako herself stays quiet for most of the time,thinking only of her book and about the dragon and the serpent.  That night, the dragon and the serpent traverse the winding river five more times before Hanako finally puts down the book and lets her mom tuck hee in for bed.She dreams about the story and imagines herself flying on the dragon's back, and riding the serpent through the seas. She dreams herself into turning into a dragon, then a serpent, then both. A dragon serpent! One who can both swim and fly.The next morning, she awakes reluctantly, sad to let go of her dreams. ----- Somewhere, in a land far away, a girl waits by a winding river. For what, we already know.She sits with her legs like a mermaids tail and stays silent and still, barely even breathing.There is a gust of wind and the dragon arrives. ""You're late."", she says. The dragon only huffs in response."
Through a Shattered Window,"Hermy walked out his front door early one hopeful morning.He stretched his tiny paws towards the sun and sighed with the simple kind of happiness that only the fresh, crisp air of early spring could bring.He lived with his mouse family in a Lilliputian burrow in the gnarled roots of a grand magnolia tree.The fragrant waxy blooms were just starting to drop their pink-tinged petals.Last year, he and his siblings had played hide and seek around the base of the tree, the petals were like overturned boats on a beach- perfect hidey places.When the game was over, the perfumed mice added the jasminny scent to their burrow, much to their mothers delight.This spring Hermy had a mission- he wanted to fly.Actually, the obsession had only festered all through the snowy winter, occupying every spare minute of his thoughts.From the time he could walk, he had snuck outside every night, no matter how frigid the earth, no matter the ominous hooting from the hills to the north.His eyes, round and shining like black drops of dew, took in the vast starscape- a clear night sky made his jaw drop and trapped his breath in his lungs.Sometimes the moon smiled fatly down; sometimes only a sliver glowed, like the fingernail of God.Then at last,  came.Their fluttering ebony silhouettes pirouetted through the magnolia branches and high into the twinkling ballroom of the sky.Bats!They were mice with wings!Hed finally exhale, jealousy and admiration fighting a battle in his heart.When the last of the flying mice chased its brothers and sisters out of sight, Hermy sighed and went to bed.He dreamt of flying of course.Normally, when he awoke in the morning, he felt a kind of melancholy that ached from knowing he was doomed to be weighted to the ground.Today was different, however.Today he had a plan.He ate a bit of bread with peanut butter and tip-toed outside before any of his siblings could sound the morning alarm and wake the parents, they were as rackety as a tin shed full of roosters!There would be feathers amongst the old damp leaves of winter, and plenty of them.He gathered over twenty the first day, most were taller than him but very light, he struggled to keep his feet when a breeze brisked up.By the third day, he had collected at least fifty.He hid them in a grassy ditch and covered them with leaves.At farmer Grumans big red barn he squeezed through a knothole and skittered across the dry dirt floor like a tiny grey puff of smoke. He made off with a ball of twine.On the porch of the charming white ranch house across the yard, old Grumans wife sat rocking and mending shirts.He waited until she went inside to refresh her lemonade, then he skittered to the sewing basket and snatched a spool of thread and a needle.He raced back to his hiding spot.When he rounded the boulder next to the hidden ditch he ran right smack into the tail of a blue jay.The jay spun around, in her beak were three of Hermys feathers!Stop thief! Those belong to me! he shrieked at the jay who was at least four times his size.The cobolt blue bird cawed, Ha!Finders, keepers!Hermy said,  found them first, I hid them here for safe keeping.Feathers belong to birds, what do you want them for anyways?Hermy looked at the smarmy bird with pleading eyes, I want to fly. And he sighed, figuring the jay would just laugh and steal his feathers.The jay laughed and stole his feathers.Hermy brushed his frustration aside, Go choke on a toadstool! he yelled in the birds wake.He found a superior hiding spot- a hollow under a spongey, mossy old log.At the supper table that evening, his three siblings chattered away.We made a bridge today!At Montys Creek! exclaimed Janey.Well, it was really just a couple of sticks, added Hammy.Janey said, Its a .Hammy rolled his eyes.Jenni looked from Hammy to Janey and back, but she refused to take sides.Mother said, You were out early this morning again Hermy, what sort of mischief have you been up to?Hermy shrugged, Just looking for mushrooms, watching the clouds, you know, the usualThere was no way he would tell anyone about his plan.His parents would forbid it and his siblings would say he was dumb.His dad said, As long as you stay clear of Grumans place.Heard they got a new cat, a saucy young Siamese.Sure dad, no problem.The next morning, Hermy again slipped into the misty iris colored dawn and down to his hidey-hole.He heard the obnoxious squawk of a jay bird and froze.He waited until the birds voice receded, then recovered his stash of supplies.He made a harness from the rope then sewed the feathers together and then to the harness.He slipped one of the straps around his neck and climbed up the tallest tree he could find.At the top, He wriggled into the harness and put his arms through the loops on the wings.It had taken all day, the sky now a deep indigo in the east.He said a short prayer...and leapt into midair!He glided downwards quite gracefully. Then panicked a bit when the ground came up faster than he expected! He flapped for downwind and soared upwards towards the sheeplike clouds that whisked away in his slipstream.Im flying!!! he shouted gleefully. His cheeks ached from grinning, while his mouth dried of all moisture; his whiskers quiverd against his face like mosquito wings.The brave little mouse flew over Grumans farm, over the woods, the meadow, and finally to the edge of town.Town was dangerous, .He tried changing direction and suddenly the feathers splayed apart, some coming loose!He fell into a dizzy spiral, plummeting to earth, his wings a ratty mess behind him.A great gust of wind blew him against a chimney that was at the top of a three-story house.OOF!He was stunned for a bit and pretty bruised.Grrrrrr He growled as he kicked the whole mess of feathers off the roof.They fumped softly and mockingly to the ground.He slid down a gutter pipe until he came to a wood molding sticking out half an inch.His wee paws pattered over to a window.The window had been shattered,  He eased through the window, being wary of the razor-sharp shards- anglers teeth- embedded in the frame.He used the dilapidated lace curtain as a ladder to descend to the night table. It was dark, with only a reflected strip of moonlight from the window. He climbed down the tables leg and hopped to the bare wooden floor.He waited for a minute, ears perked, and stomach filled with ants, until his eyes adjusted to the gloom.Hermy raced to itAnd wiped out as he tripped over something.He fell flat on his poor bruised nose and skidded a foot.When he got to his feet, he saw the leg.A birds leg.The blue jay thief- it lay silent and as unmoving as a tombstone.Serves you right for stealing my feathers!He again headed for the door, rubbing his nose gently.Shadow branches from the tree outside fell across the dusty grey boards, reaching towards him like arachnid limbs.He heard a Harpys raspy voice,stawwwwwwp.Stawwwwwp.He frozethen realized it was just those same branches raking the windowsill.He paused at the door.Hermy turned around and looked at the bird. Grrr. Rotten So-and-So!He thought, .Hermy went back and felt the birds chest.She was breathing.Glittering shards of glass lay around the bird like a halo of diamonds.She had obviously been the crasher through the window.Hermy gently pulled the birds wings open and found a ragged hole at the top of the birds left wing.Shed lost several feathers, the wing was crusty with blood.As he gently felt her wings for broken bones she moaned and came to, he moved away into shadow.The bird groaned then tested her wings. She winced as tears leaked from her clenched shut eyes.She opened them and sighed, folding her wings carefully against her body.Hermy came out of the darkness and looked into her watering eyes.The bird sat silent for a while as she brushed twinkling bits of glass from her feathers.I apologize for my behavior when we first met.My mate was killed by a bobcat just as we were building our nest.My eggs are due any day, I wasnt in my right mind, I should never have stolen from you.Im Matty by the way.Hermy said, Im sorry about your mate, thats just awful. If Id known why you wanted them, Id have given them to you.I was saving the feathers for a stupid cause anyways.Matty asked, What cause?I wanted to fly. Hermy said, feeling dumb and slumping his shoulders, Its dumb. I know, but bats are mice with wings, I thought I could fly too.The bird said, I totally get it.Next to my babies, flying is my greatest joy.Though Im not so sure I can at the moment.Lets get out of here, I have a bad feeling about this creepy place. said the mouse.You bet!Cmon!Their eyes were suddenly assaulted by bright overhead light!A tall human in a long white robe glided in, clasping his bony clawed fingers to his chest, What is this?! New subjects at my door!His eyes, bulbous behind his coke bottle lenses, took notice of the shattered glass, Or I should say windowHe cackled like an obsidian windchime.Very nice indeed. He said as he rubbed his shiny black gloves together.They made grotesque squelching sounds.He was as bony as a rickety ladder, bald and stooped, strongly resembling a Mr.Burns with a chest length frizzy white beard.His heavy glasses slid to the end of his nose.He peered over them as if spying a last tender morsel in his soup.His liver-colored lips curled upwards at the ends, like a rubberband.As he came closer, the mouse realized it wasnt a robe after all, but a lab coat, complete with speckled bits of what looked like brain matter and red gore.He pushed the glasses up his greasy bridge and said, What do you think Simon?Is this our lucky day or what?He turned slightly and Simon, a mangey scrawny Siamese cat, padded into the room.The cat licked its lips, its tattered ears pressed firmly to its head, his eyes glowing malevolently.The terrible cat lunged with surprising speed and caught Hermy in her jaws.Burns scooped up Janice in his slick rubber-clad hands.Down into the bowls of the terrible house they went.Through decrepit halls miles long, down rickety narrow stairs that complained with every step.Finally, the basement.Creepy Burns turned on the overhead fluorescents.He opened a cage on a shelf and shoved Matty inside.He then took the mouse from the cat and also deposited him in a cage.The cage was across from Mattys.There were many stinking cages. Some with alive animals, some with still fur lumps.There were two whole shelves holding at least a dozen jars each, each one containing a horror worse than the one next to it.In the hazy liquid depths faces floated.Mouths agape with silent screams and many cloudy eyes wide with the terror.On the steel table between them towered a confusion of tubing, vials, bottles, and shiny metal machines with colorful dials and glass windows with spinning needles.When Burns and Simon left, they turned out the lights.Dim light fought its way in from a small window high in the back wall.Red machine lights blinked on and off like devils eyes.Matty?Y-Yes?Were going to end up in a jar, arent we?Matty stifled a sob.Another voice floated from the gloomy depths of the chilly room, I may be next.Ive been here for two weeks already.Hermy zoned in on the voice and found it came from a cage to his left.He gasped as a face came to the bars.It was a small brown rabbit with its eyes sewn shut.The ugly black stitches leaked silvery wetness and its fur was matted with bloody scabs.Its ears drooped in despair.We have been here for three I think.Said a pretty white mouse.Next to her sat a catatonic twin.There were three of us. Her ruby red eyes involuntarily shifted to the jars on the lower of the shelves.A small white body was suspended in a clear solution, looking much fresher than the rest though all four of her limbs ended in tiny stumps.Hermys blood was freon in his veins.Matty shivered uncontrollably.Then he noticed a furry brown lump in the cage to the right of Mattys.Whos in that one? he asked the white mouse, pointing at the cage.W-w-ha? the furry lump moaned.The creature unfolded slowly.It looked black in the low light, with long gangly limbs and even longer tail.Im okay it groaned as it turned to face the cage front.His face was white in the dim light.A monkey?!Hey, Im Archie.Woah! exclaimed Hermy, Ive heard of monkeys but never thought Id see one.W-w-where am I? Archie said, Last I remember, I was in the zoos vets office.He gave me a tranquilizer to operate on my goiter. the monkey pawed at his neck.At least its gone now. And he actually smiled.(It must have been quite painful.)Were in a mad scientists laboratory. Said Hermy.And well all end up in jars if we dont get out of here.If I could get out, I could open all the cages. said the monkey.Just then a soft scratching sound came from the high little window.Shhhh! Said Hermy with authority.In the gloom, the scratching continued.There was a cat door in the human door.  went the flap as it opened and closed.The old scrawny cat padded to the wall under the window.What are you doing here? Simon asked the figure at the window.The figure replied, I miss you Pop. Its too dangerous here!Please go back to your new home.Ive heard its a nice ranch with kind people. Simon added, I love you Princess.But please dont come back, keep safe.The cat shadow at the window turned away.Wait! Hermy cried out desperately.Simon froze and turned his weary head towards the feisty mouse.The small Siamese in the window perked her ears and waited for the mouse to speak.Simon, why do you do that evils mans bidding? Whats he got on you? asked the wee mouse.Simon slumped like an old worn-out tire. He took my beloved Sarafina.Ten years ago.I followed but there was nothing I could do.He told me to be in his service would save her life. Simon shook his head sadly, she died five years ago.We had five kittens when he took her. Two went feral out into the woods, three went into town to be picked up off the street, hopefully to good homes.Princess, up there, he pointed to the window, Just found a home on a farm.Yes!The Grumans! exclaimed Hermy. I know the place!They are kind people and will take you in too.Live out your days with your daughter, Simon.Id given up on life after Sarafina died.He said he didnt have anything to do with her death but thats all hes about- cruelty, death.My heart says hes not innocentIm in.Princess, being the runt of her litter, was small, sleek, and quick as a whisper.Ironically, shed been adopted as a mouser.She contorted her sinewy frame through the narrow opening in the window.Here I come Papa! she said as she took a leap of faith to the floor.Simon caught his daughter.She immediately hopped to the table with wings invisible.She took a few frustrating minutes to open the monkey cage.Reggie leapt out, and within under another minute, unlatched all the cages with living beings still in them.At the rabbits cage, with the door open, the rabbit said, I have my part to play.Its not out there, but here, with my last friends.The monkey nodded gravely and gave her a hug, he didnt have an audible voice at that moment, just sobs.Then the acrobat grabbed tubing from the table and easily scaled the wall to the window.In the hallway outside, a scary man with a scary screech!Whats going on in there?! Simon!As the door flew open the crazy man saw the last of his captives tails slip through the window.The tail was a cats- long and scruffy grey with black at the tip.AAAAAAhhh! he screeched as he flew into a rage and whirled around.He saw the blind rabbit on the steel table.She turned her tail into the small Bunsen burner flame.It lit as a torch.She pulled the tubing from the tall metal stacks and the gases ignited in a flash.Her last heroic effort was to leap upon the mans white coathe became a torch."
Gretta's Window,"Gretta Holland was sixty-three years old when the pandemic hit. The world crisis struck South Korea in February of that year, well before it hit the states. Grettas grandson was working as an English teacher there. He had begged Gretta to get an app he could call her on for cheap, but Gretta didnt like computers for anything more than her card games, and even that she preferred to use real cards for. When Ed made the international call, his voice was tight with tension and pinched with stress. Gran, I want you to be careful when you go out. It hasnt hit the states as far as we know, but I want you to be careful anyway. Wear a medical mask when you go out, and stock up on supplies just in case. Dont be silly. You worry too much. America has the best medical care in the world. Ill be fine. Besides its only in Asia, isnt it? Yes. But you dont understand, theyre saying a person can have it and be contagious for up to two weeks. Ive been getting texts from the local government all day about places we need to avoid. Stores are shutting down to sanitize after being exposed. Theyre doing contact tracing and everything. This is serious. One of my students is in isolation because he was in the same store as someone who had it.It cant reach me here, Ill be fine. Alright Gran, I gotta go. Be safe, I love you. I love you too. Stay safe over there. They hung up, and Gretta sat in her rocking chair on the front porch, looking at the kids playing basketball in the street of the cul-de-sac, while others played on their phones as they walked in huddled groups. The Smiths drove into their driveway across the street, just getting home from a weekend trip out to the movies and dinner. She waved and they shouted their hellos back. She and her husband Ralph had picked Marina to build their home and raise their children in, because of the tight knit community, and the family friendly feel. The school was a rare gem left in the world. One of the few which still maintained a woodshop, an agriculture class, and a pottery class, all which they opened to the public during the summer. She had even taught a few classes herself before the shaking in her hands had gotten less manageable. She was an artist, and though she could still paint, no matter how good her work might be, it would never compare to what it once was. Her art had once hung in the studios of the most prestigious galleries. Though age and a shaking hand had taken her talent from her. To keep her gloom at bay Ralph had hung her favorite pieces all around the house. Lighting them with the skill of an electrician. The years had taken Ralph from her, just as they had taken her talent. Though she survived, mostly due to the kindness of their neighbors. Whom had all been there for her when hed passed. Now, sitting in her rocking chair, watching the kids play ball, she couldnt help but wonder what else the world had in store for her. It had taken so much already, and the note in her Grandsons voice nagged at her core. Her daughter, Denice had worked as a candy-striper for a few years while trying to get her medical degree. To show their support, and how forward thinking they were, theyd bought a box of one-hundred medical masks for a dollar at Walmart. She and Ralph wore them whenever they grew ill. Most of the community knew that if Gretta was in a mask, it meant she was under the weather. Sherie, would even bring her home-made chicken-soup if it got bad. She went to the closet, pulling out the plastic first-aid-kit, and extracting a mask from the cardboard box inside. Feeling silly she fit the strings over her ears and checked her reflection in the mirror. Ed had rattled her a little, and there was no harm in buying a few groceries, just in case. Soon after, the news that the sickness had spread to America hit, and Gretta would glumly move her rocking chair inside, on the other side of the large glass window. She wasnt one to sit on the couch all day and watch television, and she didnt like the internet. She would play cards with herself at the tea table. Gazing out the window and waving as people walked past. Sherie called her on the phone, waving from across the street to see how she was, and ask if she needed to drop off groceries. When she did, she would leave them on her doorstep, ring the bell, and go back across the street. Even with Sheries kindness, loneliness began to eat away at Gretta. She wanted a way to communicate with the outside world. To interact with them as she once had. In the third month of her isolation, she got out her paints, set them on the tea table, and began to paint a scene on the large front window. The large trunk of a great tree with roots reaching down into the earth, and branches spiraling up into the sky. Shades of emerald, azure, and mahogany decorated the glass. The people passing would stop to gaze up at it. Eyes wide over their masks as they stared. Each Saturday, Gretta would scrape the window clean, and start over from scratch. Letting each creation remain for the week, before doing it over again as something new. The second painting was a sunrise, in beautiful shades of goldenrod and periwinkle. Then an island, with palm trees. A lighthouse overlooking an ocean was the favorite of the family next door. During Halloween she used silver and glow-in-the-dark paint to depict an alien space craft crashing into the earth. Once winter came her painted fireplace on the window was cozier than any other. Each week more people would come, driving down their street, to admire her art from the safety of their vehicles. Some took pictures to post them on blogs, and others would honk their horns and cheer to let her know they were there. For an entire year it went on like this, and Gretta was finding she wasnt quite as lonely anymore. Though, when the following year came, Gretta realized she was running out of paint. All the paint she had gotten over her life, had ended up being stock piled in her garage and was now nearly spent. With only a few containers left of glass paint which she wouldnt be able to scrape off her window. Her mind toiled over the fact, as she scrapped away the picture from the previous week, a girl riding a bicycle through the park. How would she paint a new image? Who would come to see her and wave hello once it was all gone? As she pressed her scrapper against the glass, she pushed a fraction too hard, and the window cracked. For a few seconds Gretta stared at the crack, shocked. Then she got up and found her yellow pages book, to find the number of a repair shop. They told her it would be six-hundred dollars to fix, because the window was a unique shape and size, and it would have to be made special, but Gretta couldnt afford something like that. Coming to a decision she apologized and told the person on the phone she wouldnt need her window repaired after all. When she had been in her thirties, Gretta had taken a few classes in glass art. She still had some of the tools left over from it. Glass cutters, scrapers, grozing pliers, and copper foil. She went back to the window. Examining the fracture in the glass and planning out her approach. After cleaning her tools and getting them ready, she carefully began cutting out the glass. Piece by piece, scraping the edges down and wrapping the edges of the shards in the coper foil. Working late into the night, as the stars shined overhead, and the night breeze blew fresh air into the house.Ralph, having been an electrician, had left plenty of solder in his work room. Mumbling a thank you to him, she gathered a spool of it, as well as the soldering iron before going back to the window, which lay on the floor in pieces. Carefully she painted a thin layer of flux over the foil, before going over it with the solder, laying out smooth lines as she worked. When she was done with one side, she turned it carefully over, and worked on the other. Before gathering the paint that remained in the garage, transparent glass paint. Shed bought it for a project shed done with her grandchildren when they were young. Carefully she painted each pane as she went before fitting it back into the frame just as the sun peaked over the tops of the houses across the street. Many who had passed the night before had seen her window was broken and had spread the word that there would not be a picture that week. Thus, that morning, there was only a single child out, wanting to play basketball before it got too hot out. Though as he neared the hoop, his eyes caught on Grettas work, and he stood in awe of her new creation. Stunned by its breathtaking magnificence he could not look away. As his father came out to leave for work, he caught sight of his son standing in the street, and began to ask him what he was doing, until he too caught sight of it, and the two stared.They were the first to see her work that morning, though Gretta didnt notice them. She was sitting in her rocking chair, a spool of solder in her hand as she sat, resting after having completed her last great work."
That went so?,"Travelling in an Indian train is almost equivalent to rocking back and forth on a swing when you have no actual desire to fly. Although on a swing you are down in the dumps metaphorically, here amongst the leftover food waiting to be thrown on the tracks, empty plastic wrappers and water bottles, and the spit-out paan, you are literally down in the dumps. Even after an entire day and two power naps later, I'm a little woozy like after a roller coaster ride. A part of me also feels I smell a little but mother keeps insisting it's olfactory hallucination. As I remove my laptop from my bag, a part of me recalls last night when I was readjusting the same bag, again and again, to use as a very uncomfortable pillow. Later giving up and just sitting to get the view of the undulating countryside even though it's abysmally visible rather than the starless sky that is quite depressing, honestly. The current view of my bedroom window is not magnificent either, the horizontal grills keep interfering in the line of vision but at least the stars are visible to an extent. Also, the headlights of the cars on the highway ahead can create an illusion of fireflies if you allow them. Even though this had been an arduous trip, the thought of reaching home almost caused aversion. Don't get me wrong, I was looking forward to meeting everyone. However, the idea of the revelation of my plans to my parents tightens the coil of anxiety and makes me want to rescind this entire trip. Yesterday seems like a century ago, and everything has been going well so far. Though in my internal dilemma, it just feels like the calm before the storm. The buzzing of my phone distracts me from my internal turmoil. I call from Ivy, a human who is a perfect combination of ludicrous and scrupulousness and currently the only capable person to save me from my contend. ""OMG! look who is alive!"" she shouts even before I can bring the phone to my ear. Now is the best chance I'm ever going to get to trip Ivy after being the moronic victim to almost all her pranks. Also, Ivy is a distraction that I desperately need because, at the rate at which I've been thinking about everyone's response, I'm soon going to work myself into an anxiety attack. ""Hello?"" I do my best imitation of my mom, ""Ye kaun hai?"" Pretending to be someone else and embarrassing your overenthusiastic friend for being loud is not the best or most creative prank in the history of pranks, but it's alright for a beginner, right? Right. ""Namaste, aunty!"" she sounds so mortified. I can almost imagine her tugging her hair and mentally cursing to herself in a way that she had done numerously before when she spoke the wrong thing or at the wrong time or person or all of the above, ""Is Kiran there?"" ""You are speaking to her,"" I reply and release an involuntary chortle. ""Oh god!"" she groans, ""Why would you do that?! Do you know how embarrassed I was? You are the most insufferable, infuriating, poorest excuse of a friend I-"" ""Is there a reason you called?"" I cut her off because, as amusing as it was to trick Ivy, I cannot handle another trip down the memory lane, which she is eventually going to launch into of all the times she's chagrined. ""Well, I haven't heard from you since yesterday,"" she huffs, ""I wanted to know if you have talked to your parents yet."" ""I'm trying to settle in and, you know, plan out what I'm going to say-"" I start. ""Meaning playing every single possible scenario and outcome in your head and working out everything that can go wrong?"" she asks rhetorically. It's almost indurating at times how well she knows me and my habits. ""No,"" Yes. ""After being friends with me for more than two years, have you learnt nothing?"" Here we go with the life mantra again, ""worrying makes you suffer as many times as you think about it,"" I know that, god I do! It's not like I purposely work myself up every time for the smallest of tasks, but you can't understand what it feels when your inner coil tightens around you and constricts you from breathing or doing anything other than thinking about it. Though I can't tell this to Ivy, I know she'll try to understand, maybe even sympathise, but it will make her feel bad and will be more out of pity.I have to stop thinking about it otherwise I will start crying out of frustration and no, just no. ""First of all, you just quoted/twisted Newt Scamander's words,-"" I say I my voice as level as it can be with a bit of smugness. ""Beside the point,"" she interrupts. ""Secondly, easier said than done."" ""Kiran, think of it this way, you are eventually going to tell them, right? No point and procrastinating and postponing it and making yourself suffer through it again and again. Also, what's the worst-case scenario here? It's not like they are going to disown you and never talk to you again. Maybe they'll be sour for a while, but then eventually everything will go back to normal."" That's the great thing about Ivy. Even though she does not understand the entire concept of anxiety, she won't give you faux assurance about disaffections. Even when you are stuck in bad situations, she distracts you and prolongs you from worrying so that you freak out at the right time. Mostly, acting maturely like an adult person. ""Yeah, okay. I'll do it tomorrow."" I agree, ""Anyway, what's up with you?"" ""Well, my brother-dearest here ate all the crackers and left all the broken ones for me and WON'T HAND ME THE TV REMORT WHICH IS SERIOUSLY CUTTING MY CARTOON TIME!"" she passive-aggressively shouts the second half to her brother, I guess. Scratch whatever I said before, Ivy is a childish twit. We talk for about an hour before I fall asleep while talking and hit my head on the grills of the window when she was talking about the latest show she started watching. She recommends I watch it, but I know I'll keep repeating the same series that I've watched hundreds of times before. I bid Ivy goodbye and circumvent a comfortable position (or as comfortable it can get) to fall asleep. The efficacy of nervousness is still present. However, in this no-man's-land between sleep and consciousness, the trepidation seems almost feigned. When I wake up, it is because of the incessant clamour and chaos in my dream, the palpable drop in temperature due to the open window, and partially because of the overwrought feeling that I will miss my station when it strikes me that I'm already home. Even though I have more than three hours before everyone wakes up, I decide there no use in trying to fall asleep with the tumult within. Also, there is an agitated voice that keeps insisting me to think what if dropping out of college doesn't work out as I thought. I close the window and stand up. I try to stretch my limbs though they are so heavy and numb it creates an underwater illusion. I switch on my phone and realise it's about to die and rush to my study table plug it in, grateful to have a working powerpoint, unlike yesterday that made me vary in using my phone because it will die and, I will be left with no means of communication. Though observing the exodus of passengers get in and out and perpetual railway tracks did a laudable job in keeping my thoughts of future acrimonious discussions at bay even though they adhere. Sadly, no such distractions are available today. With nothing much to do and for a space from the failure outcomes, I start reminiscing about my very first train rides along with my parents. We used to carry packets of crips and soda bottles, how I would always fight for the window seat and then question my mother about the crops of multiple farms. I also recall being paranoid whenever my father would get off at some station to buy something or to look around, and I would freak out and beg for him to come back so that he doesn't get left behind. ""Kiran?"" my mother whispers, and I bang my knees on the corner of the table and feel an electric current pass through my entire leg. ""What are you doing up?"" she opens the door wider, enters my room and turns on the light. I close my eyes effectively blinded by the brightness. ""I need to talk to you and dad about something,"" I say, it's now or never. ""Oh, okay,"" she says, still squinting, ""wait, let me go and pick your dad up."" ""No, we can talk in the morning..."" I trail off because she is already out of the room. Maybe it's just best to get over it, and if they disapprove we can all pretend it never happened like some nocturnal tomfoolery. ""Kiran?"" dad comes in and sits down, mom following close behind ""what happened, sweetheart?"" The nickname tugs my heartstrings, god. ""I wanted to talk to you about college."" I want to disappear, maybe I should just tell them my test scores and call it a night. No, you are already here just spit it out. ""Yeah? Just know that we are very proud of you, and you are doing amazing, none of us has gone so far up until you,"" he says. God really laying it all out here, arent you? ""It's just,"" I look at the bottom of the wall where it connets the floor and is not painted well, not the point right now kiran, focus! ""I just think I'm not intellucatly challanged enough there now,"" Oh god, what if they flip out ""And my software desiginging business has been picking up,"" don't look at them! ""So I was planning to drop out of collage and persue it full time?"" it comes out more like a question and I'm teriffied and throat is so dry, I feel like I'm going to throw up. I grab my water bottle, hands shaking and take a sip. Finally when I look at them father has a furrowed expression on his face and mother is staring into void. Finally after what seems like an enternity, he speaks up. ""Okay."" Okay? Okay what? No this is a waste of time, no reminder how you paid my tution, no- ""You are a big girl, you are smart, you know what's good for you so I'm not going to hold you back"" he says and pats my back. ""Tell me more about the business in the morning tho"" he says and leaves. Well, that went .... well."
The Happiest Girl,"Once upon a time, there was a girl. Shes always happy because her life is lovely. She has nice friends and nice parents and her house is big and sunny. When shes older, she gets a boyfriend who is always sad and just a little angry. She doesnt know and thinks hes nice so she keeps him.One time this girl becomes pregnant with a child and she becomes very scared and cries a lot. Her friends remind her that she doesnt have to keep it, so she doesnt. Its perhaps five years or so later when she becomes pregnant again, the child pressing into her skin insistently, so she has it even though there isnt a father. The girl who used to be very happy becomes very sad. And she isnt as brave as she was before.It is not easy for her. Her daughter is beautiful and perfect, but she always wakes up in the middle of the night, her squeaky voice raised shrilly in protest of sleep, and the girl has to drag herself out of bed to get her. The girl is barely more than a child herself, most of the time.The girl is losing money and she goes to her family. She has not seen them since she became pregnant (for the second time, what a scandal) but she hopes theyd be willing to help her, at least for the sake of her daughter. But the family says no. They tell her not to come back, and that she cannot return home again.The girl cries all the time and isnt happy, not at all. Her friends go to parties and she stays home stirring milk and changing diapers. Her money is shrinking to nothing, and theres no boyfriend who would at least hold this little girl hed created. The girl is sad, with no idea what shes doing.She makes a choice.She tells her daughter over and over that she loves her, that she cares about her, and that is why shes doing this. Her daughter, just a year and a half, barely understands, but clutches her hand and looks up at her with trusting brown eyes.The girl finds a family with frizzy hair and big smiles, who are sad to see her have to say goodbye. They promise to take care of her, and her two new siblings took her daughters hands. She looks at them both, then at her mother. She is puzzled by these four strangers who dont look like her, holding her and preparing to take her away.Her confusion fades to screams when they put her in the car and away from her mother, and she scrabbles at the window like a cat, and the girl who is no longer happy cries but turns away.Her daughter rides off, and the girl returns home to grow up the best she can.The girl goes to bars with her friends and snuggles on the couch with boyfriends, but she feels as though theres an icicle in her heart, blisteringly cold and painful and doomed to never melt. Her family continues says that she cant come back, and the girl lets herself be crushed by their words for a few years. Then she wriggles out from underneath the boulder and makes her own family out of the people around her.Sometimes, rarely, the girl receives an email from her daughters family with a photo or two attached, photos she only opens when shes very drunk. And then, when she quit drinking, not at all. Or so she says.She looks at her daughters face, as it changes. Her pale skin tans in the California sun. The pink bikini she had bought for her disappears and is replaced by a blue one. Shes not very tall, but her waist is slender and her body beautifully formed. Her face matures, narrows into a heart shape, her light brown hair taking on pink highlights then no highlights. She starts wearing glasses to read. Her friends are all laughing and pretty and smile at her with an affection that tells the girl her daughter is sweet. Her birthday cake when she turns seventeen is blue with a surfboard on it and in the background-- the girls heart stops-- her daughter is kissing a boy with waves of blond hair, a tiny smile lingering on both their faces.Her daughter is beautiful.The girl stays trapped in the past for a while, letting the regret crush her. Then she decides not to let it anymore.She meets a man who talks loudly and loves hiking and drives a cute little Prius to pick her up, sticking his head out of the window with a dopey grin. She falls in love and they have a wedding with a blue cake.He wants kids; she always knew that. When the subject is broached, she fights it for a long time, not because she doesnt want them too but because shes afraid of breaking them again. He drives her to therapy and she works through it, week after week.The first one comes, and its a son. Hes perfectly built with small, steady limbs and blue eyes like his dad. He grows up to be adorable and funny and so patterned with freckles, the girl thought she might be able to count a constellation in there somewhere.The second is another son, quiet and gentle, and the third is a girl-- skinny as a wire, round glasses perched on her long nose, a booming, joyful laugh, and a waterfall of beautiful blonde hair. the girl sometimes catches herself thinking, on movie nights or car rides or camping trips with her husbands voice warbling into the trees, The girl lives her life and her daughter lives hers, two separate worlds that coexisted once but dont anymore. The girl wonders if she misses her, if she remembers. Sometimes at night she whispers to nowhere at all, but then she wakes in the morning to her childrens squalls as they try to fry pancakes, and she manages to cast the thoughts aside.She never loses the icicle in her heart, but the pain of it changes. Some days it melts a little bit, like when her sons come back from camping with their father, wild-eyed and recounting adventures which may or may not have happened, or when her brother sends her a tentative card, or when she sees her second daughter, proudly marching over the shyest, most nervous girl in her middle school for a declared, Abbys coming over for a sleepover tonight. (Abby turns out to be wildly funny and excellent at imitating accents.)Sometimes the icicle is colder, like when her mother dies in a car crash, or her sweet son comes home crying because a girl called him fat, or when her daughters family sends a picture of her, beautiful in a wedding dress, kissing that same blonde man up front with those tiny smiles on their faces. , the girl thinks, studying the picture through watery eyes, reflecting on the bitter truth that she had missed it. Such simple facts seem incredible to her.The girls life marches through patterns of normalness that seem devastatingly interesting only to its inhabitants. Her son ships himself off to Egypt to study archaeology, and her other son devotes himself to raising his triplets while his socially awkward, too-smart wife clacks away every morning in heels and a pantsuit.Her daughter marries someone elses daughter, and Abby, laughing and the life of the party, stands proudly as the maid of honour. The girl claps in the stands, smiling through tears, and tries not to think about the other wedding shed missed. The girl and her husband start to fight, then separate for a while, then come back together again. She hugs and kisses her grandchildren while wondering if she has others hiding a world away.The girl is draped in skin like cobwebs when she leaves, reclining in a white hospital bed, crying as she holds her familys hands and crying because there is someone missing.She lives a good life with an icicle in her heart, a family that left her behind, and a question pounding her temples through every moment of her life:  Shes scared to find the answer.The girl ascends the steps into heaven, draped in a white gown soft as bunny ears, guided through gates with riotous patterns and designs. She looks for the others, and theyre standing there in a group, waving at her and calling her name. She recognizes her grandmother, her mother, her brother. And one other face.Smiling at the front, her heart-shaped face shiny with tears, is her, dressed in pale blue robes. The girl recognizes her instantly by the curve of her grin and she hears a voice, a voice that takes her back to just yesterday, it was yesterday, wasnt it, so long ago but not long at all, beautiful and clear and echoing in her ears with that trace of a grin, she swears:Mummy! You "
windows,"In this morning, as all the previous mornings, Sam sat at his coffee table gazing at his beautiful colorful glass mosaic window. He made this window glass, but he never submitted it to its more general purpose, he never opened it. When the light hit these beautifully organized pieces, it gave rainbow colors that lit the room. These colors changed seasonally, it was an intentional work of genius by Sam and nothing gave him more joy in his isolated life than admiring it with a cup of coffee.He built windows glasses for churches, for castles, he was the top of his craft and now he is retired. He devoted the rest of his life to reading books and painting. He had never been interested in having friends or family. The things that made him happy were by the wind and sun and they could not be yielded, so he let them on their own, and he could not be happier than to excuse himself from satisfying.The breeze twirled the autumn leaves and Sam could her their rustle and he would smile and be filled with joy, but he could never see them from where he was sitting. He lived in a small apartment of an old building at the second floor, the only room facing the backyard garden was the room he was sitting right now, with only one window.Another morning, Sam woke up with his usual thoughts and wishes nothing can disturb this beautiful morning, he grabbed his coffee and headed to his favorite room. The perfect position, the perfect lighting, what a beauty and setting unable to keep his eyes off the window. CRACK, the window glass shuttered on the floor. Sam sat paralyzed at first in complete denial no, a rock didnt flew through the window, no, its not the crown jewel of my life work shuttered on the ground, then a burst of rage filled him.Sam heard a knock on the door and rose abruptly. Even with all this anger Sam was not very talkative, he stood frowning at the man who had knocked on the door. The young man, forty maybe forty-five, was overwhelmed by shyness to say anything first, and seemed very guilty and sorry. You Sam growled. My children were playing I am very sorry, come here kids and apologize said the man hastily. Three kids, one girl and two boys, moved forward. I am so sorry sir we are very bad, said the smallest boy, tears filling his eyes. Kind of an accident sir, said the girl. Dont say kind of, idiot said the tallest boy.Well, YOUR aim was badHe pocked her so she said to Sam in a calm voice.Sorry sir, the pigeons flew near your windowAnd why were you throwing rocks at the pigeons said Sam in frustrated anger. They started all to cry now even the tallest ones eyes watered.The father tried to apologize, but Sam was visibly grunting. I will pay for everything, just give me a price, Sam motioned him to stop talking then shut the door while they were still looking at him. Stupid children, he thought squatting on the floor touching the broken glass postponing cleaning it. He looked at the window, on the broken glass at the floor, on what remained on the window, back to the floor and so on.The window never had been opened, now shuttered was a completely new view. Should he challenge his genius again, create something more astonishing. But could I he thought, my hands trembling, my sight worsen. No, it will not do. I dont remember even how I made it and I am in decline. Sam nerves not too long ago risen with anger took a big dip to sadness and he felt weaker than ever. The window glass was a reminder of a grand era in his life, a souvenir of an excellence he once reached, I made this ever day he thought, and this morning it had been the last time he did, and he didnt know.Like a good friend, this glass comforted him in his bad days, now gone and replaced by a cardboard, waiting for repair. He grew more irritated, suffocated and in want. The room bleaker, he decided to remove the cardboard, he saw the garden from this view for the first time. Sam did not feel mesmerized or agitated by its beauty, he found it a normal garden and yet in this normal garden he saw a glimpse of the world, a world he felt a part of only now. He then participated in the plot of life, a viewer of children playing and adults chatting, with no glorifying as simple as it can be, and he felt for the first time, since many years, that a new day had started.The window had been fixed and Sam had nothing left to do. He went to the window, the three children who broke the window were playing outside, he stood and watched them for a while. At 11 pm, he went to backyard garden where the children were still playing and talked to them.Hey, come here he motioned to the older one, who was almost 13, did you visit the Graise castleNo, we were meant to go there as a school trip, but the teacher who agreed to take us there became sickThe other two children paused their playing and were looking at them.Adam, what are you talking about with the old neighbor?, shouted the girl. Adam looked at her without answering.Tell your father to drive us there as a compensation for breaking my windowAll of us?Yes, you and your brother and sister, he alluded at them and then add half an hour and I will wait for you at the gates, hurry up, he said that and stooped away.In the car the childrens father, named Hassan, would not stop talking, as measured in the standards of Sam, he kept apologizing and thanking Sam for the opportunity to repay him, offering him money again. Sam though not in the custom of being polite and revolted by the general idea of small talk, only sighed twice. The children in the back were very noisy for his taste, the two youngest kept asking about the grounds and making needless comment of amazement. The older, in hurry to be mature and wishing it to come faster by pretending, tried to speak of the weather and something about politics, he remembered hearing in the news last night.When they reached the castle, Sam descended from the car and in bold steps walked in the front guiding the others not looking back but making sure they were behind him by hearing their footsteps on the pavement. Ahh, we are going this way said Hassan smiling, but in complete puzzlement.You see this, I made it when I was about 30, Sam was standing in front of a big glass mosaic window reaching up to the ceiling, the other four remained quiet. Really! Nothing, I thought at least you would have something to say, Sam said to them specifying the little girl. its really pretty, I love flowers, she said shyly.The window glass was shaped in the form of a bouquet of flowers, colored in red, purple, and blue with a brown to orange background. It is best lighted this time of day, from the late morning to the afternoon, it was the time this room would be most frequently used. It is really pretty sir, said the little girl as if comforting him and feeling guilty for contributing to breaking his window. Dont feel bad about it, said he, smiling, you see there is a flaw nobody knows of but me and keep that a secret he said the last part threatening, half-jokingly, this chunk should be yellow and smaller, come here look closer. Sam sat all the afternoon explaining to the children and their father how to make a glass mosaic window, and on their demand, it was a once in week lesson, and he to his own surprise was not very disturbed by it."
Midnight Chaotic,"It was a quiet, eerie night that left most unnerved by its silence. No cars were driving around, no people walking about, even the neighbors in the apartment next door were quiet and not fighting. It was a definite weird sensation to be held, making one wonder what was so different about that night than any other night? Standing quietly, peering out into the darkness of the world was one Phayre Lark. Her long dark hair hung down her back, unkempt from her restless night's sleep. A thin silk robe wrapped around her body, hiding the t-shirt and shorts that she wore to sleep within. Her bare feet stood firm upon the cold wooden flooring of the apartment she shared with her goldfish, Tink. Even that night, no bubbles could be heard from the swimming fish leaving her dazed and left to her thoughts. Something was definitely off, but she couldn't put her finger on it. Her eyes roamed the streets just outside, usually busy with rushing cars that were laying on the horn or people walking the sidewalks to their nearby destinations. Sometimes a siren could be heard as someone was arrested or being chased down for some obscene crime they had committed. However, that was not the case that evening as she looked back and forth slowly, her green orbs never leaving the outside world. A world beyond her window, beyond the inside of her apartment, a world she would not rather be a part of. In fact, she would rather just create her own little world right there within her own home. A single street light flickered off to the side catching Phayre's attention. Her green orbs shifted to look at the faulty street lamp, flickering as if it were trying to get the attention of anyone inside. Well, it had her attention. Her arms crossed in front of her chest, weight shifting slightly as she finally tore her attention from the street lamp and let her gaze fall to the ground. She watched the floor and the way her feet moved as she shifted her weight from side to side. That was when her gaze was pulled back outside. A single car had driven by the apartment building, catching her attention as it slowed and moved through the city. A little black Nissan that had little skull decals on the back window. Nothing like a little rebellious action to make anyone mad, especially parents who had probably bought the kid the car. A gentle chuckle escaped her lips as she Phayre moved one of her arms from where they were crossed and combed her fingers through her dark tresses to keep it from falling in front of her face. A single orange tabby cat jumped from the alleyway, her eyes moving to follow its trail across the street and to the building across from her. A small boutique she had never entered, a place too expensive for her taste and too pink for her liking. On either side were small restaurants, the Cajun restaurant on the right was one she had frequented quite a bit. However, it had been closed the past couple of weeks and no one knew when it would be reopening. Shaking the thought, Phayre moved away from the window, closing her curtains so no one could see inside. Her steps were careful, quiet, barely making any sounds as she crossed over towards her room. There was nothing left to see in the eerily quiet city. Midnight had come and gone faster than she could blink and it was another day the coming morning. Climbing into bed, refusing to take the little silk robe off, Phayre laid her head gently upon her pillow. She stared at the wall for half a second before letting her emerald orbs drift shut, taking her off into an oblivious dream world. Somewhere she could create and disappear into until morning's light would wake her from a fitful slumber. Even in sleep her mind was hectic, uncontrolled and running free. It was as if she could no longer slow it down, control what thoughts she needed and what thoughts she didn't. Her mind was chaos and the streets were her only solace when it became too much. To watch the people and try to figure out what they were up to, counting the cars that drove by to find out which was more popular than the other. Without that distraction, Phayre was left laying there with her eyes closed and sleep avoiding her like the plague. Frustrated with herself, she rolled over and allowed her eyes to open once more. Another wall met her gaze, pictures painted by herself hung on every inch of the wall. Colors of blacks, red and pools of blue all mixed to create complex yet dark masterpieces that should be upon canvas, not the computer paper that she used instead. Her pieces captured the chaos that she felt within her mind on a daily basis, a chaos she would have preferred to silence much like the streets were that evening.With a heavy sigh, the papers swaying ever so slightly as her breath hit them, Phayre forced her eyes closed and pulled the large forest green comforter over her body. She tugged it up under her chin and curled her legs up to her chest as if it would protect her from the thoughts that invaded her mind at every second. She remained restless, even as she reached, grasping for the sleep that she knew would never come. If it did, it would be there far too late and she would be left with another sleepless night. She would end up welcoming the morning, watching the sun rise behind the buildings once more if sleep did not blanket her that evening. She could only pray that sleep came swiftly and that she wouldn't see the morning light that would greet her in only a few short hours. A morning she wished would wait only once so she could escape her chaotic mind and rest soundly without interruption."
The Day It'll Shine,"Looking out my window and hoping to see more than my reflection. What I did see was this same girl standing behind me reaching over to touch me. That same girl was me.When I turned around she looked exactly like me. I looked back out my window hoping to turn back around and not see myself standing there. So, I close my eyes wondering if my imagination was playing with me, but when I turned back around and there I was still standing. Is this real? Am I still asleep? Closing my eyes once again, hoping to wake up from a dream but when I pinched myself I heard a laugh. She told me, this is no dream, I see you as you see me. Looking at the time making sure its not devil hour, its late but not 3am at night. Should I scream and wake everyone up? But, What if what Im seeing is just an illusion? I can here my mom now asking me to talk to some shrink while my brother is laughing. He probably wouldnt let me go to the All Star Game next week. I am pretty sure I can handle a ghost. Whats the worse that can happen? Oohh, My ghost is going to eat me. Tear out my flesh and take over my life. Okay now thats not funny because Im not sure what she wants. Yea, thats the question, What does she want? Alright, Im ready to help my other self find peace. So, What should I call you? I asked. Duh! What does everyone call you? Tammy, she said. She has a smart mouth I see. Okay Tammy? What can I do for you? Why are you here? Is there anyway I may just be seeing things? Placing her hands together, she started to move towards the bed and then she answered. You called me here and Im not sure why Im here. I should be in the future picking glitter out our son hair after our daughter painted his nails. Now Im here with you while our idiot boyfriend is at home asleep. Boyfriend? I have a boyfriend? Thats not the point Tammy, I have a lot to do beside play chit chat with you. Jason is his name and you have not met him yet before you ask. Now, Can you answer my questions? Wow! Shes a cranky one with a smart mouth I see. So, let meget this straight, I called you from the future without knowing how and your blaming it on me? No, I know this is a dream now. Its time to wake up Tam. Wake up! Wake up! Slap Why did you do that for? I asked. I was just helping you out, she replied. Now are you awake?I am still here trying to convince a 3 year old to believe I am Tinkerbell. Sarcastically saying, Yes I am still here! Shocked as we were to be, stuck without a word to say. We both sat down thinking if there is any reason why this is happening to us. Where is the connection? Is there something we missed? Hold up, she said. Whats your deal? What is it your going through? I told you whats going on for me in the future and its time for you to tell me something. Do you have any tissue? I asked Why? I m sure I can take it, she said. Well, if you cant remember, tomorrow will be the day I have to tell mom I saw dad with Miss Lisa. I promised dad I wouldnt tell because of moms condition, but I cant take it to my grave. What I saw the other day was not right and Ill be wrong if I didnt say anything. Wow Tammy! Is this really the day when I told mom that dad was having the affair? Tomorrow, it will be and my stomach is killing me. Dad is going to be mad at me forever isnt he? No, not at all. Really? I asked. I shouldnt be telling you this Tam, you may want to sit down for this. Oh my, I wondered if I wanted to hear what she was about to tell me. Ouch! Why you do that? Sorry, I was hoping we both would wake up, she said. She knew that wasnt going to work cause it sure didnt work the first time. Dont tell me! I warned her, I want it to be how it should be. I know wishing 10 yrs would go on and pass me by only. Only.. Tam!! Did you wish you could go back 10 yrs by chance? I sure did! Yes. I did. Only because I missed looking out the window here at moms when I need to be alone and think. When I would glaze out the window, it was as I left my body. Life at that moment didnt exist. It was just me and the universe and it felt peaceful. Looking at her expression reminded me what our grandmother would say. No matter how cloudy it may be. No matter how bad the storm can be.. The sun will soon to shine and shine days after. Sometimes things may seem rough and out of control, but it wont last forever. Yes, Now thats true acceptance she would say. So, telling mom the truth will be rough, even if it disappoints dad. Eventually he will have to own up to his lies and deceitful ways. Right? Yes, Now for me, I know Jason may not understand how much I hate how he lacks not having any responsibility whatsoever. I need to stand up and tell him how I feel even if it puts our relationship on the line. Yeah, it will be rough without him, but itll be easier without him. All I ask for him to do is put a lot more effort in besides using it all up on the video game. If not, Im sure the sun will shine after the storm."
That Feeling You Get When You Leave Your Window Open At Night,"It is one of those long, hot, sleepless nights in the middle of August. The kind where you feel like the sun is still up and with no AC it feels like it might just be inside your bedroom. It is one of those nights where you feel like you have to open your window the one with no screen, you know, because the fan is simply not cutting it. You know that there are bugs out there, but at this point who cares? Right?	So, you open the window. It feels so nice for the first few minutes that you actually start to drift back to blissful darkness when you feel the patter of tiny feet on the back of your neck. You slap the infernal insect away before its proboscis can pierce your skin and you feel that you have won this battle. The cool outside air and the breeze provided by the open window are so relaxing that you figure a night of battling with bugs is better than restless tossing and turning.	There you are, just about to relax again when you hear the lazy buzzing of a fat and winged beast floating in on the wind. You brandish your fly swatter like its a sword straight from the scabbard of King Arthur himself and you dash your foe upon the rocks, taking its puny life. You feel like Beowulf, champion of the people, and knowing that you have just brought peace to your kingdom you return to your pillow, exhausted and ready to enter into a sleep almost as deep as that of the fly you have just slain.	Just as the last drop of wakefulness is about to leave your mind you feel The Presence of some infernal beast. Your eyes dart to the wall just under the window. It stares down at you with too many eyes as it lays there perched on too many legs, waiting for its opportunity to strike. Leaping from under the covers you once more lunge for your weapon. You square off against your foe, nearly as nude as the beast itself and begin to exchange rapid blows. The spider is too quick however, and it eventually scampers into that corner, you know the one, you cant quite reach it without stepping down from the bed, and so you decide to call it a draw and go back to sleep.	Now, its quite nearly two oclock in the morning, and you decide that no foe will keep you up any longer, after all, you have that meeting in the morning and you absolutely cannot be late, not after last time. You shudder to think of what Janice from accounting will think if you have to scamper in there with your tie half done up and your coffee spilling all over your sleeve. Those judgmental looks are just not going to be welcomed, not again, especially after a long and hot night like tonight.	Your eyes once again start to drift closed, thoughts of the sneers of your colleagues compelling you to sleep when you hear the sound of insectile feet scampering across your bedsheets. Oh no, you think, you are not going to take me like this, and you snap your eyes open just in time to see the many legged battle tank making its charge right for your pillow. The nasty creature has claws like iron and so many legs that you couldnt count them all, even if you had somehow managed to graduate Kindergarten. You naturally squeal like a small child and slam the first blunt object you can reach into the earwig over and over again until you are certain there is nothing more than a nasty smear left of your foe.	You look down at your bludgeon and read the somewhat smudged over numbers as 3:28. At this point you are resigned to a sleepless night, but a night of such terrors is simply not worth it to have a minute amount of added comfort. You slide the window shut and the lock snaps into place with a resonant click. You settle into your once again sweltering bed and resign yourself to the rest of the night night spent sweatily tossing and turning.	Keeping your head far away from the new smudge on your otherwise somewhat clean sheets you lay down to rest once again. When sleep finally and reluctantly takes you the only dreams you can dream are tainted with images of nasty vermin crawling all over your bed, you feel smothered and oppressed by the thousands of tiny insect bodies that are pressed upon you You jerk awake. The final echoing call of the horn of battle has sounded. You grudgingly press the snooze button and flop back down to stare out the window into the faint light of dawn. At this point the nine additional minutes of sleep are all you have left to hope for before you have to have a long and tired day at work.	What you see is enough to scare the hooves off a bull and you leap from your bed. Thousands of insects are perched across your window, clawing and scrambling to get in. You realize that the tapping you heard on your window was not, in fact, the tree that often plagues your sleep, but several Goliath Beetles wielding together nearly an entire stick which they are slamming repeatedly into the window. A crack is formed and is starting to widen.You raise your trusty, and at this point somewhat disgusting flyswatter and take a battle stance. If you are going to go down you arent going to do so without a fight.	Bang!	Bang!	Bang!	The crack widens and ants begin to pour through. You are laying about yourself with the swatter and meting out unmeasured destruction upon your enemies.	Unwittingly you are also helping them and with one final smash the shards of the window crash inward, carrying all the hosts of damnation itself upon their backs.	You stand no chance, but you are now getting rapidly surrounded and realize that hope is lost.	You have taking hundreds, if not thousands of their lives, but at what cost?	Their hosts are endless and you are but one.	The inevitable happens.	You fall.	The last thing your darkening vision sees is that spider. You make eye to eye to eye to eye to eye contact with the nasty creature and the world fades to darkness, all you can see is the smug look on the face of that tiny turd blossom.***	Two days later the day starts for detective Jones with a missing persons case on his desk. The first place he naturally checks is your apartment. Youve been gone for two days and your friends and family got worried. He kicks the door down and walks in with cautious steps. He steps through the door to your room and sees an unusual sight.	There are shards of glass all over the bed and obvious signs of a struggle. There is a grimy flyswatter laying on the bed, and the room is otherwise empty. It must have been a kidnapping he thinks as he takes out his note pad and takes his notes. He begins to leave once his report is finished, jumping slightly when he notices the spider that has established quite a nest in the corner of the room. There is no sign of you, and there never will be.	There are fruit flies on the bananas."
Moon and my shadows,"Moon was full and big tonight. She looked so close and bright. As I peered out of my bedroom window, I could feel her emotional intensity. It was so intense that it jolted me out of my dream in the middle of the night. It was like my soul could feel her watching; judging; envying. Moon and I had a special relationship. We stayed up late chatting about my daily adventures, but she listened to me cry myself to sleep most of the time. She liked it this way. She liked having me to all herself. She didnt like sharing me with Sun because when I spent too much time with him, I didnt need as many chats with her. The nights I slept peacefully, she would watch me sleep through my opened window. Sometimes she would try and shine her light on my face to wake me up but it didnt work. Tonight, she was upset. Youre spending a lot of time with him lately Mila! You know its hard on me when I dont spend time with you, Moon expressed. I know Moon but as much as I love our time together, I am human and need to sleep during the night. I cant keep getting up in the middle of the night to hang out with you at the window. Im sorry., I said, bowing my head down, wishing her goodnight and retreating to my bed. It was hard on me too. Most of the time I spent with Moon was filled with sorrow and heartbreak. I am tired of being sad. I thought. I couldnt understand why she was making me feel guilty for being happy. When I officially met Moon, I wanted to die. I guess I could say that she saved me. One night, I sat at my window, crying, praying to Moon to help me through this heartbreak. I prayed to Moon to hear my cries. She did. I heard her soothing voice while I cried and struggled to catch my breath. I had my mothers pills laid out in front of me with a glass of water. I was ready to go. But then I heard her voice. Calm, like a melody. Like the sounds of the ocean waves. So soft and calm yet it pierced through my drowning tears and choked-up cries. Every night after this one, she visited me. She hung high in the black sky yet sat with me. She held me in her arms, played in my hair, and listened to me weep. A shushing sound would escape her lips as I wiped my tears on her glowing skin. Once in a while, she offered wise words that made me think but it usually just created stronger tears. She gave my shadows a safe space. She shone her light on them, unafraid of my demons. She gave them kindness and compassion. She looked them straight in their piercing red eyes and said, I see you. I do not judge you as you are here for a reason. Lets talk. One of her best quotes was,  She was right. The more I cried out my pain and chatted with her in the middle of the night, the more I woke up rested and rejuvenated the next day. Sun was pleased. Good morning Mila! Sun said one morning. I had woken up early. I hadnt done that in a long time! I slowly opened my eyes, yawned, sprung out my arms and legs to stretch and peeked through my window, smiling. Good morning Sun! You are looking bright and joyful this morning! I replied. It was a different kind of morning. I didnt feel sad. I didnt want to turn my back to Sun and cover my face with my blanket. I didnt curse Sun for being alive. I didnt blame Sun for my anger. I was happy. I wanted more of this happiness. Then I thought of Moon and I felt sad again. If I wanted to protect my happiness, I couldnt spend time with Moon anymore. She always brought out my negative emotions and I couldnt do that anymore. I wanted to be better. I didnt want to cry anymore. I was grateful for Moon and everything she did for me but, I didnt need her anymore. I wasnt picking Sun over her like she made me feel like I was, I was choosing myself. I told myself. I thought I had it all figured out. For the next few weeks, I avoided Moon. I went to sleep before she awoke and woke up when she went to sleep. At first, I could hear her crying but I ignored it. No more crying for me. Only happiness. Positive vibes only my friends would say. It worked! I was happy! Until I wasnt. I was so focused on being happy and positive that when situations triggered my shadows, I suppressed it all. I pushed it down deep, all the way into my toes as to not feel the sadness. When I reached out to Sun to regain my positive vibes, he was too busy partying and surfing the waves of the day to listen. He would just laugh and say, Be happy! Positive vibes only! Enjoy my rays and relax! I loved Sun and how happy he made me. So much so that I would spend hours and most of my days with him. But lately, I wasnt feeling great. My happiness felt fake. It felt like a mask I had to uphold. I couldnt be sad. My shadows had been faced and filled with Sun. I couldnt be sad again! I needed Moon. I needed a heartfelt chat. I needed to make sense of my emotions. She was the only one who could help me. She would be so upset with me. She must hate me now. As the sky turned black and the stars sparkled, I waited for Moon. I waited and waited. Then I cried. I apologized for ignoring her. I cried big tears expressing my love to her. I expressed my need for her. I missed her healing energy. I missed the space she gave me to release the negativity of the day. To release all that heat with which Sun filled me. To release the stress and suppressed shadows of the day. Sun was great at keeping up the tempo and making you dance all day long but Moon helped me slow down, face my heavy emotions, and re-assess my daily decisions. Moon helped me release my fears, my self-doubts, and heal my triggers that my past wounds re-surfaced. Oh Moon, please forgive me! I need you! I prayed. I covered my face with my hands and let go. My tears fell freely into my hands and then my lap. I didnt care. Mila? Honey? What is wrong? Moon asked. I glanced out my window and came face to face with Moon. She was so beautiful. So gentle and compassionate. She looked genuinely worried about me. Moon?! Youre here! But... arent you mad at me for leaving you? She lets a smile and says, Of course not Mila. All I ever wanted was your happiness. If that is with Sun, then I am glad. I AM happy with Sun. But he doesnt listen to my shadows as you do. I dont happiness is meant to be alive forever Moon. Ive been struggling to keep my corners lit with his light. I cant banish my shadows. You are not meant to sweetie. There will always be corners therefore shadows will always exist. Shadows are not bad. They are messengers. They teach you what you need to heal. They show you what you need to face to maintain that happiness you speak of. That is why I am here but Mila, do me favour? Sure Moon, what is it? I asked. Dont be afraid of me. I may amplify your emotions and trigger your tears but I also heal and release. Our time together doesnt have to be negative. It can be empowering. It can be cleansing. Especially when I am full and round, this is when my powers are at their greatest. You dont have to see me every night, but please visit me when you need to. Dont suppress your shadows. I will always be here to shine my light and help your shadows find peace. Even when you dont need me, I shine through your window and fill you with my healing light. I am not here to make you sad Mila. I am here to help you find peace. Moon was right. I nodded as she asked her favour of me relieved that she wasnt angry with me. I was most relieved that I didnt have to end my relationship with her. I just had to change my mindset and how I viewed her role in my life. She always had a positive impact on me and was always one of the reasons for my happiness. I just didnt see it because I was in a negative state whenever we spoke. I promised her that from now on, I wouldnt only visit her when I was dying. I would visit her when I was happy to make sure that my shadows were being heard consistently before they became a threat to my survival. Thank you Moon for always being there when I need you most. Thank you for helping me grow emotionally and find happiness WITH my shadows."
Nana's Window,"My Nana lives with us. She is 78 years old, her hair is short and gray. Some days we go outside. Nana has a lot of trouble walking so we stay close to the house. Most of the time she sits in an old shabby recliner by the north window. She seem lost in her thoughts.I asked ""mommy why does Nana just sit by the window like that""?Mommy says ""that is something you need to ask Nana.""So I ask, ""Nana, why do you sit by the window?""Nana gazes at me over her horn rim glasses then says ""sit here Mira and let me show you"".I climb into her blanket covered lap. She points out the window and asks ""what do you see?""I reply ""I see trees, grass and flowers.""Nodding Nana says ""Yes, those things are there. What else do you see? Try sitting very still and watching.""So I sit still and watch out the window until finally I start to squirm and say ""there isn't anything else too see""Laughing Nana comments ""Mira, you will have to open your mind and your heart to the magic before you will see and understand why I sit here.""Just then my friend Kim arrives and I go outside to play. While we are playing pirates, I tell Kim about the talk I had with Nana.I tell her ""Nana says I have to be open to the magic before I will see what she sees.""Kim asks ""Do you believe in magic""?This makes me stop for a moment then I reply ""if Nana says there is magic, then there is magic. I just don't know how to 'open my mind and heart' to find it.""After playing for a bit longer Kim says ""I have an idea"".Kim runs over to the shed and grabs two boxes and puts them under Nana's window. We sit down on the boxes.Looking around Kim says ""you told Nana you saw flowers, trees and grass, right""?I reply ""that's right"".Grinning Kim says ""yes, but I also see a small gray cat chasing a squirrel"". She points across the yard. I see them too.Suddenly, a ruby-throated humming bird flies right in front of us on its way to the feeder on the porch.Kim whispers ""Mira look""!I look, I don't see anything so I demand, ""what, where""?Grabbing my head Kim turns it so I'm looking just above the grass line on the tree. Something moved.As I keep staring I ask ""what is that""?Kim squeaks ""I have no idea"".As we continue to watch intently for what seem like forever when a huge toad jumps out of the grass. We both fall off the boxes. Then laughing from our new seat on the ground we watch as the toad heads for the fountain.With a smile I turn to Kim and say ""lets go ask Nana if that was what she was talking about"".Turning towards the weathered window with its new screen; Kim studies it before she replies ""I really think there is more to it, cats, squirrels and toads don't seem magical to me"".Once we are inside, Nana smiles and says ""I see you girls joined me by the window. Did you see anything magical""?We tell her about the cat chasing the squirrel, the humming bird dive bombing us and the toad scaring us.Then Nana said ""let's try an experiment. Kim close your eyes. Mira tell Kim what you see out the window.""So I tell Kim ""there are trees, grass and several flowers"".Nana says ""okay reverse the process. Mira close your eyes. Kim tell her what you see out the window.""Kim tells me ""I see trees, grass and purple and blue flowers"".With a smile Nana says ""that's good. Now both of you close your eyes and I will tell you what I see."" After we close our eyes she begins ""I see three trees, one medium sided oak tree and two smaller pine trees. There are purple calla lilies near the oak tree and blue asters along the fence. The fence is wooden and shows signs that it's time for some new paint. The grass is green; mostly short except around the tree trunks. Open your eyes now. Do you see anything new""?At first all we see are the things Nana described. All at once we start noticing blue jays, cardinals, chickadees searching the ground for warms, monarch butterflies floating across the grass, tree frogs climbing the oak tree and a spider spinning a web between the pine trees. Both of us start chattering to Nana. She gives us a hug and we sit watching for a bit.Nana picks up a small book and tells us ""listen to the story as you continue to look out the window.""Taking a deep breath Nana begins "" The air is still as the afternoon shadows begin to dance across the lawn. Birds sing softly while the frogs join in the chorus. The butterflies sail from flower to flower. Rabbits raid the carrot patch, while chipmunks hurry to get the nuts before the squirrels hide them. All while the fairies prepare to start their day. When humans rest the fairies work their magic. Some repair broken foliage, while others set new blooms to open...""As Nana reads Kim and I begin to see fairies of all shapes and sizes gathering the things they need like sap, water, and silk. We watch as they flit about, we hold our breath as it looks like one is about to greet us in the window. At that precise moment my mom says ""Kim your mom is here to pick you up, Mira get washed for supper"".We blink and look out the window to see that the spell is broken. The only things we see are the ones we were looking at before Nana opened our eyes. We know now why Nana sits by the window. It truly is magical."
I am a dreamer.,"I have always been a dreamer. I dream days and nights, regardless when and what about the dreams. I feel like wandering my mind in the air, among the galaxy, among the twinkling stars and among the aroma of yours. I like swimming in the ocean of your creation, drowning myself in the miraculous world you had created for the blessings of the human race, surfing in the wondrous miracles with the hands of our Father Almighty. You are an Angel of mine. I used to have a dream, dreaming of you running in garden with me, it is our Edenic garden where no worries and sadness can invade our peace and serenity. Here we have everything we need  the sweet fruits of your virtues, the purest spring water from your river, the brightest sky from above, the clearest cloud floating, and the freshest breeze to brush my face. I used to have a dream, dreaming of you lying down on the ground, with your belly on the ground and your back face the sky, despite all the dirt and mud, your army uniform had never been so shining and beautiful as you were on a mission in peacekeeping. Guiding and guarding the safety of lands and territories. With your hair get with ashes and dirt, they were still smooth and soft and dancing in the air. There is no any other scenery prettier than this Mans portrait when he is saving lives. There is nothing greater than a Man sacrificing himself for the peace and liberation of his people. For justice and peace, this is a real Man. I used to have a dream, dreaming of me and you, sailing on your favourite boat that you made for yourself. In the middle of the lake, we were feeding birds and ducks, and hanging our fishing tools in the icy cold water, and never forget to catch our favourite salmon fishes. The weather is cold with a little bit of breeze, the water is freezing cold, but we didnt mind, because we have each other, together at the same moment, on the same boat, under the same sky, and with the same person. I used to have a dream, dreaming of you playing judge in the military auditorium, placing charges to soldiers who violated the National Defense Act, and giving justice to people who deserve it. I used to think, if I got caught by the military policemen, maybe one day I could be judged by you so I could see how cool you were in the court. With all the reputations and integrity, all the trust and wisdom you had acquired from your military experience, I have never had a single doubt about your competence and intelligence, especially when you still feel like a innocent little boy from the very depth of your heart. I used to have a dream, dreaming of you flying in the sky, and I was at you cuddle, together with you making fancy moves in the air. There are smokes and patterns made in the sky, you made a shape that represents you and me, and the shape that smells like the burnings of your spirits, and the furious ambition from your courage and compassion. You talked to the ground with pride, and your melodic voice has never sounded like a command but a song that could last eternally. You had to put on a very cool sunglasses, because even the Sun, needs to be protected from your beautiful eyes with lasers. Your pilot uniform has always been so fit with your athletic body, which is always ready for parachuting, for robe climbing and rescuing people from the sea. I used to have a dream, dreaming of you running through the jungles, and I was the lost wild animal, waiting patiently for you to come, to rescue me from this miserable world. I was taken into your cuddle, your great care to the shelter and to a great hand. You whisper into my ear, but I couldnt hear anything, because the frequency of your voice, had drugged me into coma. You presence is like an Angel, who would arrive by my side no matter when, where, how, and what happened. You are so forgiving about what I had done but to rescue me and kept me alive, because you think, there is nothing that cant be restarted, everything can redo and do well as long as the person has the mind put into it. You show me the real definition of not giving up. As you demonstrated, you never give up on anything, anyone. Especially oneself, you believe that everyone has the potential to do something good and big, it might just take a while, but it is totally possible and feasible. I used to have a dream, dreaming of you operating the submarine in the water, and I was the mermaid, luring you into my ocean, thinking that maybe one day, I could get this beautiful man join me in this mysterious but beautiful submarine world. Although you said, sea and ocean is never mysterious, it is only deep. But I am telling you, it always has many wild animals that bite and could kill, just like the human world. You then told me that, as long as I am brave enough to march forward with courage and truth, I should never be afraid of anything. Take yourself as an example, no matter how furious those bombs are, how aggressive those terrorists are, and how dangerous the situation is, as long as you can still feel the pain, it only means that you are still alive. Then all you have to do next, it is stand back up and trying again, until one day, victory comes to your arms. I always have a lot of dreams about everything, but ever since I met you, my dreams only have one person, it is you. My most courageous Hero and the most beautiful Man on Earth."
Paranormal? Laughter... I talk to the dead all the time.. And no one notices.,"Let me be honest. I am disabled. I am missing an eye, a foot, and my mind.My mind, I debate with myself if I am missing or not. But I am assured by the Shrink I was taken to that I am dead. And? He wanted for me to pay him money for my visits.So? I took him some place. How? Shh. I am what I am.Afterwards, instead of visits costing me money. He prescribed pills, and that was that. I did not have to go to his office.What did I show him? I showed him the truth about reality.Scary? Sure, I suppose if you were him. Makes you realize you are in a game called life and someone else might be playing you. And you are not winning the game.Which is awkward.And me?Oh, I am a Non playing avatar these days. Why? When I play, I expect things to happen. And now?I doubt if two people will read this.And? One will ignore the sh. And the other will yawn and not realize the truths I am writing about.Truth one. According to a very smart man. The secret of light is a secret. Meaning? Read the book. If you can understand the poetry. You can walk away with this as truth. You eat plants, plants eat light. Wola, you are nothing more than a stabilized energy or avatar playing in this game.Truth two? Anything you see is dead. Sh.. That is a secret you have to live with the rest of your life if you got this far into the story.Dont believe me. Read the Zombie galaxy or is our Milky Way galaxy a zombie? Then ask yourself one question. And realize the answer.If you can not find the question to ask. The question is if all I see is dead or stabilized. Does that mean I too am dead? The realization from that answer is awkward and absurd. But I assure you the answer is what it is.When did I start talking to the dead? I think when I was four or younger. I spoke to a lot of dead people. If you want, you too can do that. Go to an old folks home and talk with a person.They are all dying to get out of here nowadays.However, a very long time ago. In galaxy not like this one. But in another reality, they had wonderful stories to tell a youngster. Tales of working on New Deal writing project.Tales of writing the real-life story of Butch Cassidy. Tales of a train bound to Saint Peters burg to save the Czar.Tales that would blow your mind.And?Well, I listened I was a kid. What else was I to do?And?I wonder.Those tales got me through some rough realities.Now I talk to the dead a bit more or less because they want to escape their hell. Which is not nice, I suppose.But they are in hell. I can tell you hell is real. It is not a nice place to live in.Nor vacation in. Or anything else, for that matter.So, paranormal? Well, that is a matter of opinion. If you died, say when you were born and somehow ended up in someone elses body. Who is to blame for that?I am not sure anymore.To be honest, I am not sure.Oh, how old am I?In this body 50.According to the internet and my writings since 2016? Something like 4.5 billion years old.Laugh with me.You see, I wrote a lot. I write a lot.I journal even more.According to journals, I awoke in Sagittarius 2016. And Well, I lost 1.2 billion people in my reality. I am quite sure deagel.com had 8.5 billion people and US had 365 million US citizens and numerous illegals.Now?Who knows?I am, after all, just writing what I wrote then repeating things with memories? Or data? Am I real or just data that is the sad question, is it not?Paranormal? Sure, I guess that is what I am talking about. What did I learn in a billion years?That everything is possible and those opposing the will or Fate of God should stop what they are doing and pray forgiveness.Outside of that?Who knows?I dont.Am I talking about Mandala effect? In a sense, the wheel of time. Which way is the galaxy turning?Clockwise or counter clockwise? Which way does a soul spin when moving from a dead reality into the day of judgment?That is the awkward part of this story, is it not?For me being 4.5 billion years old or talking to the dead?Either case is absurd and wildly illogical. In yet?Here I am and here you are. And?Tomorrow you might be hell and I need to say. Pray repent. Beyond that. Believe in Jesus?Who else can save you.Let me tell you about hell. People wont like you there.It is awful in a sense like Wheel of Thrones book where in alternative reality Rand finds people have changed from good to evil.Sadness. You can not trust people.And those trustworthy?Well, usually end up in jail, dead, suicide, or in AA if they are lucky.Meaning?The world has lost hope, faith, and trust.Not a very nice place to live. I assure you.And?Beyond that?I can tell you Hillary Clinton did not lie about Abe Lincoln being a senator. For I am sure he was a senator in my reality, too.What does that mean to us here and now?I suppose this is one day in reality when a paranormal person passes through saying HI and Goodbye.And you might catch a glimpse of the idea.But the knowledge that this life is already all dead and gone?I am not sure. I dont know.Fate is real, so saving you is beyond my scope of this story. And my soul?Judgment day or? Well, that is the kicker the bible has changed here too and?Who knows what is possible with God or Adonai? I sure did not expect to be on Orion's arm nor Orion Nebula after all for years I assure I was told was on Sagittarius."
AI or OI or is OA the newflex story forgot to mention.. laughter from the zombie worlds,"People forget. I forgot. To be honest. I was dead, a lot longer than anyone realizes.You see that question. Who was the president in 2016? Laughter.. If I tell you who would have won if Katrina the hurricane struck in 2003, not 2005 like here, you would laugh.Should I?OA or AI or Alice should have said Bobby Jindal. Not Obama for President in 2016. Meaning?So few reality shows talk about the alternative worlds we travel. And AO or AI or Alice are checking peoples perceptions and memories. Laughter.You see, not all realities are the same. Nor do they end the same.Can I tell you how some ended? Yes.Going backwards in time? I suppose?2017 December 12 Hawaii was nuked. The retaliation from that destroyed humanity. Can I tell you more? I could, but I have a longer list than you would expect.Let me skip to the more interesting ones.2003 Katrina called in by HARRPA to stop the discovery of 20 trillion dollars missing from the US tax payers.You see, not all hidden things stay hidden in a persons lifetime.The unique part of that? People think Atlanta, Georgia or the CDC is where the zombies came from? Laughter again.That story is an auditor went into a level 5 bio weaponized lab. The back up files required of all government offices were stored 6.5 miles from New Orleans in the basement of the lab.And? Well, instead of discovery, which happened in some realities. They let loose a virus on the auditor to see what would happen. And? He lived. But no one else did for a time.Zombies are real folks.Thinking back farther?Communist fighting? How about this 1978 when Russia not in this reality invaded Afganistan and Jimmy Carter nuked Russia?I can still remember drawing those pictures. That was horrible.Or prior to that? Sure.When JFK went to NASA in Dallas came out and told people the US government have been dealing with aliens since 1950s. That destroyed everything. Meaning?Depended on the reality but most people can handle thinking of aliens but dealing with them and realization that all your technology since 50s are fifth or sixth deleted obsolete versions of something truly could change humanity changes how mankind thinks of itself. Oh, there was 6 in the limo and the governor was shot in the neck as well.Or the time Jackie shot JFK? Or when the driver looks shocked turns around and shoots JFK. Or when the car is white and four seats?Why the hush hush about this? It is the end of time now. No use saying we did it right. For an ending is an ending, and this is an ending.And for me?I am pretty sure another ending is coming.I mean the CIA with Bill and Resident evil computer system turning everyone into the living dead to fight.That is the funny part. Giants? The giants are coming folks. And the living dead. And when that is over?Well, the UFOs or heaven which ever you want to say it is. Their technology and magic are so similar you could not tell the difference.Prior to that?Well, there have been many endings for, if you play as an avatar, 70 billion years I suppose.Will I play again?Doubt it. I am broken. I can not even fight a squirrel these days.A squirrel. Maybe that is a recurring event?Yes, why not a squirrel, the tale of Detroit riots.The Detroit Riots 1960s.Some forget that the Speakeasies took a lot longer to remove than a change in legality of drinking.Meaning? 1919 prohibition law to stop deviant behaviour at times lasted a couple more decades in some realities.And?Well, vampires are not what you would believe in just yet here.But there? The blood plague that you are starting here with quantum dots and concurrency inside your vaccine took effect some people much more than you would expect.Meaning? Their ability to survive depended on exchanging live blood for life.And?Well, quantum entanglement and sins and judgment etc aside. What you do here has affects in the afterlife or zombie galaxies here. And?Well, that goes into age. Did I get born in 71 or 63? In what calendar? In what reality?Meaning? I might be a billion years old. And you would not know it because I look 50.And?Well, vampires at times find the most amusing things to do.This one created a vampire squirrel in revenge. And let it loose in Detroit. Causing the Detroit riots of the 60s n 70s.Why?Love, I guess.I already wrote that story.Maybe deja vu is better.Did the book state Interview with a Vampire or Interview with THE Vampire?Makes you think for a sec?Life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you are going to get.If these are not the zombies worlds, why are all the good quotes in the past tense perfect? Life was like a box of chocolates you never know what you are going to get?And if this be the zombies worlds?What actually happened to the vampire and squirrel? Shh.. That story is for another time and place.Maybe the phrase 11:11 over and over again?To understand that phrase or number repeated, one only has to realize that time is at an end.And when it flips over?Boy, are people going to be surprised. Especially me.Why?Simple. I died a long long time ago.And I listen to stories these days.I wonder if people ever read stories these days?BE good. DO GOOD.And I look and wait and see. NOPE.Seems like another Ukraine or another issue pops up.I wonder.Did reality always end this way?I am assured it had a happily ever after story once upon a time.In yet when I ask those stories, the storyteller turns away with a tear making me wonder. Are they stuck in hell forever?Must be. Because the next day they claim I am nut and dont want to tell me their story."
You are a Sign of Beauty and Intelligence.,"I am looking for a sign. A sign could guide me through the darkest moment of my life, the deepest valley of the mountain and the most mysterious ocean where I had drowned.I am looking for a sign. A sign could lead me through the mist, through the jungle of mazes, through the foggy forest, through the most furious thunders and storms. I am looking for a sign. A sign could show me the path of hopes and dreams, the beautiful marbles on my journey, the toughest weeds and wildflowers grow on my way to my legacy. I am looking for a sign. A sign could coach me when I was lost in the sea of confusion, teach me when I was mazed by temptations and illusions, show me how and why when I was confused by evil and villains. Then you showed up in my life, my Hero. You are a sign of phenomenal beauty. I have never seen anyone else like you. No matter what happened, you always face the situation with the most gorgeous smile. I often ran to you and asked for your help when I was bullied in school or at work, then you always told me that, when I am facing bullies, just simply smile at them, they would think I am going to bite them. Honestly, this trick works every time I tried. When I was bullied, I felt sad and defeated, but with a smile, my mood and temper magically disappeared and I also had the most power weapon for bullies  forgiveness and courage. As a honorable Veteran, you taught me, hatred is the origin of all evils. Hating someone might hurt your enemies for a while, but it will hurt you at the same time and leave a scar on your soul. I watched your scars and wounds from the battlefields, which you had fought for most of your life, I believe in you and I am keeping my smile. You are a sign of forgiveness. Ever since I was little, I had always been a terribly naughty child. I could never settle down in any situation and I was almost diagnosed with some mental problem. I was too active so I triggered so many troubles and some people even called me trouble-maker. Until I went to you, I was not sure what happened to me, I was totally tamed by you. Maybe it is because of your experience in coaching high school boys in baseball games, maybe it is your years experience in leading and coaching soldiers in several battlefields, maybe it is your true love in teaching, maybe it is your genuine talent in herding people, maybe it is your ingenious insight in studying people, maybe it is your intelligent thoughts in psychology, I am not sure. You never mind what I had done in the past, and always remind me that, everyone can have a chance to go back to the origin as long as the person put a mind to it. You always say, between good and evil, there is always an option, and the choice can be made by no one else but you. Tomorrow can be beautiful and ugly, and you are always the person who can make the choice. This world is beautiful because you make it beautiful. I always leave your words in my mind, and they always make me smile and never give up for the future. It is your forgiveness and generosity give me hope and dream, and give me the courage to move forward. You are a sign of greatness. You are a very humble person and always look like a friendly convenient store man. No one can tell from your appearance and behavior, that you were a once fought in battlefields where terrorists were raging their fires and guns and killing innocents. No one could tell from your smile that you were a serious military Judge who was responsible for exercising justice and make sure the society is in a fair environment. No one can tell you were a Man, who drove various airplanes and tanks to go to work, monitoring submarines and swim with mermaids, flying in the sky with birds, running in the jungles with wild animals, and saving lives as always as a Superhero. You never brag about your past, because you said, whoever stay in the past would likely get PTSD and you think the future has more interesting things to look forward to. You are always reminding me that, life is always like a clock, no matter what happened, it always has only one direction, which is forward. No matter how terrible the past was, there is no way to move back or stay, but go forward with courage and faith. You are a sign of intelligence. Ever since I met you, I had barely made choices with terrible consequence. Your method is a universal principle, which is to do everything with truth, courage, and compassion. I always remember you said, when you were a leader in the army, you made yourself study psychology very hard, until you made sure you understand all your soldiers and to herd them better. Because you know, every decision you made, it is about life and death, every step you take, it is about the failure or success of a mission. You always deny that you are smart, but a Man who always loves learning and studying, but never being slaved by the enormous amount of information. You are very humble about everything and I have never seen you brag about your success and triumphs. You are such an adorable creature. You are a sign of cuteness. I know I am not smart, but you are always patient enough to teach me everything until I understand. I am very dependent on you and I cant even imagine what the world would look like without your help and assistance. Your guidance always brightens my path forward and I need you. May God blesses this beautiful Genius, to have a long and happy life."
Nan,"The school bus always dropped me off at the corner of my nannys house.Bus 535.It was always sticky, and my light-up sneakers always stuck to the aisle. My best friend was on that bus. We got off at the same bus stop; she lived down the street.Nanny would always be waiting at the house, ready to fill my stomach with chocolate pudding or cinnamon-sugar toast.My little brother was already there, not yet school age. My older sisters would be there too, having come home an hour earlier from high school.Wed play outside on the swingset. To a six-year-old, nannys backyard looked like Disney World. A playground with a slide connected, with swings that when swung too high, the poles would come out of the ground. Your bottom would fly a few inches off of your seat, but you just held on tight and swung even higher. We had bikes, scooters, and all of the popsicles we could ever imagine.Nanny loved to play card games with us. War and Go-Fish were two of our favorites. I dont remember who won, but I know that every game was filled with laughter and hot tea.Dinner was always something that we liked. Hot dogs with mac and cheese, chicken fingers, or our favorite potato soup. Sometimes, mom would even drop by with Burger King.Nanny had well water, which means that showers and baths were never long. If we took long showers, she would run out of water. To me, this was a godsend. I never liked taking showers or baths and I hated getting my hair washed and always put up a fight.Most times, I would sleep with nanny in her bed. We would fall asleep watching her favorite shows under her sheets that smelled like sweet honey lotion. Sometimes I would sleep on the couch in the living room. Without fail, requesting the cream-colored sheet with a mini strawberry print. That was my sheet, and when nanny couldnt find it, Id throw a fit until she found it.Id get up for school the next day and we'd do it all again. It was a routine, and almost every day was the same but it was never boring.Easter, birthdays, Fourth of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. All of them were celebrated at nannys. Her rancher house would be packed full of people. Cousins that I'd only see once a year, aunts and uncles who would sneak me five dollars, big sisters who brought my nieces and nephews. The spread of food nanny would make could probably have fed a small village. Everybody always left with a plate of leftovers for the next day. But dessert was the best part. At Christmas, nanny would make homemade root beer. The bottles would line the floor right behind the table. Ten, maybe fifteen bottles of root beer sat patiently waiting for Christmas day to arrive. She also made homemade sugar cookies with frosting. Each cookie was a little different. Some were shaped like Christmas trees, bells, or angels. For Easter, they were egg or bunny-shaped. They'd be topped with colorful icing and an array of sprinkles. No matter what shape though, I could always put away four or five at a time.Nanny definitely didnt let her grandkids be skinny, she knew how to feed us.At Halloween, all of the kids in the family would go trick-or-treating in nannys neighborhood. Nanny would make her famous potato soup and everybody would bring hot dogs. The kids would all sit on the living room floor in their costumes and trade pieces of candy after a big bowl of soup.As I got older, family parties and holidays started to get smaller. Someone was mad at someone else, someone passed away, someone had to work, grandkids got older and didnt want to go anymore. But I was always there. And I was always the last one to leave.I dont believe in psychics, but if I did, Id think I was one. At summer camp, youre not allowed to have your cell phone. Its just a week where you disconnect from the world. I was eighteen and it was my last year of camp. Normally, I would have had fun that week, but I knew something was wrong back home.Nanny has cancer. mom told me.I had been home for a day.I dont remember what I said that day. I just remember mom telling me that it was going to be okay. That she was going to get surgery and be okay.Nanny had surgery. Went to rehab. Had surgery. Went to rehab. It was a vicious cycle.I went to college. Called nanny every week. I always told her that things were going to be okay.Nanny had a good spirit, but inside, she was terrified.I was too. I just couldnt show her that.Nanny got worse every time I saw her. Every time Id come home from college, she had declined.At first, she wasnt able to walk as fast. Then,she wasnt able to walk without the walker. Soon after, she couldnt walk at all, and it was a milestone every time she took a few steps.Slowly, our calls got simpler.What did you have for dinner? Id ask.I get to come home in two months.Im praying for you nanny.Ill see you soon nanny.I love you, nanny.Our calls never lasted too long, she had a hard time hearing and comprehending.Within four months, two of nannys sons died.A year later, she was bedridden. This wasnt the same woman who would get down on her hands and knees to scrub her kitchen floor, or who would hold two babies on her hips at one time, or who would spend hours in the kitchen cooking and baking.It only took two years for the cancer to spread to her entire body, and on top of that, she had a broken heart.The last I saw nanny, I kissed her head, gave her deteriorating body a big gentle hug, and told her,See you soon. I love you.Not even a week later, she was gone.My mom got a phone call, my sister was on the line.Shes not going to be here much longer, she said.I said my final goodbye on the phone that day. I know she could hear me, she just couldnt respond.So on the other side of the country, opening day of Junior year, I held my broken mom in my arms.Her sobs were heard throughout the entire campus.Every memory of my nanny flooded through my mind.Learning how to ride my bike in her backyard, the ten-dollar birthday checks every single year, watching Christmas movies, sitting outside the bathroom as she got ready for bed because I was afraid to be alone, the big family Easter egg hunt every year, how she would call every squirrel she saw, Frankie. Every memory became so foggy, but her kindness remained crystal clear.Some people in this world are kind because they have to be. Nanny was kind because thats who she was. Her kindness was like warm sunlight coming through the window, it was like snow on Christmas day, it was that salty sea breeze on the beach, it was like the cinnamon sugar I put on my buttered toast as an afternoon snack.It was warm, full, sweet, and you could feel it.No matter who you were, where you were from, what you had done. Her kindness reached everyone.Ive read that the brain can hold up to 2.5 million gigabytes of memory.Id like to believe nanny takes up a lot of that space."
My Sleep,"I have 100 dollar bills running around my sleep, when I wake up they all go away and I am inside a forest full of beauty and shining, I walk outside while my soul is lifting with the sun that comes from the tallest tree and the biggest mountain, the glaciers of water surround me and rotate around my world of dry tears and empty thoughts, I wonder where everyone else is at an what kind of problems I have, without money, without a house, without anyone to talk with, in the most beautiful place yet to be in. As I come down from the air everything freezes and it gets really cold before it starts to snow and a lot of memories make me feel warm. I speak mundane and I walk towards views of fogginess that surface around in every corner I wish to settle in. And if it starts to rain I wont know what to do as my lips no longer can move, I close my eyes and imagine I know where I will be if I continue to keep my legs moving, and all of a sudden, I run into an envelope, saying: Fear your new views, your new thoughts"", and I begin to think, is this being said to me because I no longer care about where life takes me? And my steps become stumps and those stumps became regrets and the sky gets dark and here comes another forest ahead of me, and I get wild and start running chasing nothing just my fears, and I stop at the tip of a waterfall full of life. I think to myself If I see the sun or the moon or the grass green in the morning if I happen to be sad only because I dont have much, then what do I have? Ambitions, selfishness that is all illusions to a new beginning which is only so far away, do they matter, do they make my present, so if I go down this waterfall will I find everything I had been looking for? Do our worries come from this earth that gives us everything we need? Do we really care deep inside about ourselves? Or what everyone expects us to have? Where is the long elastic-free ride to the feelings of self and what it means to run away from whatever wants us to be like everyone else, I come to this end, hoping it will be my best view before who knows what happens next, you see you can actually go anywhere with your feelings as long as you know deep inside you are not living trapped and nothing will stop you from waking up every day and knowing you will be okay with or without clothes, a place to live, or finally a dog? It doesnt matter what you do not have, what matters is how you feel and what actually is most meaningful to absorb and never let go of as this one life can raise you from the dead and take you back and swirl your world make it all green until you finally wake up and see what other colors are to live. You might call crazy, a person who is happy for reasons you cannot understand, when a person desires to feel happy nothing should stop them, you enter a world without meaning to the actual reality, where you may be lonely but you understand to be alone will serve you just as much, it doesn't matter as long as you understand that this world is not small at all to believe we are alone. If we decide to residue in the waves of the ocean instead. Well, then bloody salt, I cannot swim down further on my dreams. you finally wake up and see what other colors are to live. A good time to be bornto be felt to be bleeding, and surrounded. By allthe open Sky; Its all part the whining. And bloody sweat of one big wound that is also celestial,a shower of clear water if one knows the meaning of it.It all comes together like the sea at times picking up anything or devouring it as fast as the wind that manages to make it all seem less irrelevant.Oh, my love, where have you been.I have grown to learn that it feels like you've built a character out of the little I can control.How is it that even though my sleepand all of my thoughts you take over one way or in all forms.And if I dont rely on youI am a dead fish or the salt of the sea,undrinkable, and unable to be used by humanityas well as the destroyer of all kinds of regular forms that cannot standwhat is made up of.While the leaves of the trees continuously come and go, how the salt of the sea sucks the fingers of the human cells up and dries the skin after you stay in it for too long, even if we care or if we don't whether you love the sea or cant help being soaked by it oh thats how love feels when you are missing from those you know as much as from those you dont.The sea may bring much more fish and have all kinds of creatures and hold the deepest secret but nothing can have the same meaning. The salt that surrounds it is as different as the water and The water that makes up the living for the fish is a single as the strength of every wave that brings the living and shakes the earth. And if I were to fall in it with all of this blood I would not know how long I will last forit is all kinds of creatures that are silently enjoying the single right of existence and nature and are so used to it,so dont expect my blood to last me much,When it is all gone, as I float around bleeding myself outI will remember the waves' sounds and how the sun made my heart feel warm. as timing allows the most powerful force to take over meI wont have time to think much unless I am ignorant enough to listen to how my body reactsand remember First or beforeif anyone out there ever made me feel I was presentand sucked out as well as in while drowning in my own."
An unwitting accomplice,"It all started with a frantic tapping on my bedroom window just as I was falling asleep after late-night bingeing on various TV channels. I initially subconsciously blocked the noise out, thinking it was noise from upstairs, where a new couple had moved in over a week ago. But the persistence was hard to ignore as I tried turning over in search of a warm spot while nestling under my duvet. A flash of light crossed the blinds, accompanied by continuous tapping. Scrambling out of bed in frustration, I peered through a slit in the blinds and saw a bearded face mouthing something indecipherable, forcing me to cautiously open my ground floor window. 	Sorry to disturb you, I am Dan, your new neighbour. I moved in with my wife last week. We havent had a chance to introduce ourselves. Unfortunately, I forgot my key and locked myself out. Please could you let me in?	How do I know who you are? Yes, I have heard someone moving furniture upstairs. Dont you have a spare key? Or alternatively, why not contact the estate manager?	I dont think they operate a 24-hour service. The spare key is with my wife across town. I thought I should try you first rather than phone anyone else. Im sorry, I also dont have anything to identify me by, apart from this parcel with my name on it, delivered today. It is too big for the post box, and the postman left it nearby.	Putting on my dressing gown, I padded bleary-eyed to the front door and opened it.	Thanks, mate. You saved me. Otherwise, I would have had to phone my wife for the keys. I am sorry to have disturbed you. Good night.As Dan made his way upstairs, I closed out the blast of cold wind coming through the front door and went back to bed in pursuit of my elusive sleep.	Early the following day, my cleaning lady Dina came as usual. She had been a regular since I inherited her services from my parents when they moved to the coast. I was one of those people who tidied up before her arrival. Sometimes I wondered why I needed her services since she was adept at shifting dust from place to place rather than keeping the home clean. Whenever I explained to her that I could look after myself, she would start the sob story about my cleaning contract putting food on her table. Having worked for me for so long, she felt she was part of the family. 	You started late today! Youre lucky you are self-employed! Dont you start, Dina. I had a rough night. First, my new neighbour woke me up, knocking on my windowpane, wanting to get into his flat. Then I couldnt get back to sleep!	Oh, so youve met the husband, have you? I have not even had a glimpse of the couple. They are keeping themselves to themselves.	Theyre still settling in, and the wife only comes during the daytime till they get themselves sorted.	Whats he like, the husband?	I was half asleep and didnt take too much notice of him. Tall, dark hair and a scruffy beard. That sort of thing. I let him in, and he went upstairs.	The day dragged on while trying to write the next chapter of my new short story. I had spent more time revising the plot in my head than putting anything worth keeping on paper. I was glad I was not paid by the hour. Then, a gentle knock interrupted my flow of thought. 	Yes, how can I help you? I opened the door abruptly to find two unfamiliar faces staring at me.	Sorry to disturb you. We were on our way upstairs and thought we should not put off introducing ourselves any longer. We are the Watungas, Dan and Vimbai. We moved in last week and had heard that there is a famous writer in the building. It is good to meet you. We hope we are not disturbing you. 	The couple were in their late 60s. The husband leaning on a walking stick, wore tartan carpet slippers, a grey tracksuit and large black-framed glasses on a clean-shaven face. His wife was slightly taller with sharp blue eyes, hair in a chignon, a calf-length tweed skirt and a blue pullover. They looked content in their skins.I asked them in. The couple shared the sofa and started chatting as if we were old friends. They reminded me of my parents in their younger days as they finished each others sentences.	Dan, who was the more vocal of the two, said, Apart from introducing ourselves, the reason we came to see you is that we thought you could help. We have not fully moved in, waiting for the utilities to be sorted. Our daughter said she would organise that side of things. But shes always so busy. At this rate, well have to delay moving in properly till the weekend. 	Dan, Im sure our new writer friend doesnt have all day! Have you forgotten what we came for? said Vimbai jokingly.	I get carried away sometimes. The oddest thing happened last night. I know were getting a bit forgetful, but I could swear that we locked the main door when we left after unpacking yesterday evening. However, when we arrived today, the lock had been picked. Overnight, someone broke in and scattered our belongings everywhere. My wifes few valuable pieces of her familys heirloom, including an emerald brooch and pearl earrings, are now missing. Otherwise, theres nothing worth trashing the place for. We thought you might have heard a disturbance from upstairs last night.	You forget to mention your gold fountain pen, said Vimbai. Weve searched high and low and cant find it.	Yes, theres that as well, said Dan. It has left us very unsettled. And we havent even slept in the flat! No-one warned us this was a neighbourhood prone to break-ins!	Thats most unfortunate! I wouldnt say there are many burglaries reported around here. Have you already redirected mail to this place? I said without sounding too inquisitive.	Yes, my daughter did some online shopping for us and sent it to this address. It has probably already been delivered. Now you mention it, we havent checked whether theres anything for us above the letterbox. Why do you ask?	Im just curious. A while back, someone stole all the parcels left above letterboxes. But it is not something which has happened since.After that revelation, I changed the subject and advised Dan and Vimbai to call the police before ushering them out.	In my police statement, I had to admit I let someone in, who it was now clear, was not the new tenant. The resulting criminal investigation proved fruitless, and the file joined all the other unsolved cases."
Like  a shadow on the surface...,"When that ghost of the spirit came through  it came to play shadows on the surface of the window...Well you know? It is all about Lin again. Lins mum for sure did believe in ghosts. So growing up listening to magic and to odd stories can make you begin to see things. Both indoors. And outdoors.The family lived out way beyond city-life. Rather among farmers and peasants and just opposite to the church. The ghosts on that site could make anyone see and sense that vision through all windows in that godamn house. It could be labelled a mansion, as the priests had lived there once way back in history. That is why Lins mum talked about priests that she saw when gazing out the garden. Through all those windows that sort of surrounded them from each sides. Everywhere there could be tapping on the chrystal senses of the opening out to the remote place. Countryside that is.As the priest had been the important once among farmers there were gossips about the priests, both the living and the dead ones. More so about the dead priests as they were thought of to peeping in from the openings of the walls. Weird kind of word it must be, but opening there was.And one November night Lin could see a shadow flippering in the glass of the window. Aha, John F Kennedy was there to visit them. She spoke nothing about if for the whole night. But when morning came Lin asked her spirit master mum about it. How about if Kennedy wanted me to see things? How about if there are political ghosts peeping in, and not the priests as you said? How about?Well her mum had a debate with herself. Thought about it with her fishermens and sailors mood and said that no one could be sure. The next night mum sat down at the very kitchen table, white and round, and began peeping out herself. Did she see flimmering shadows dancing on the surface of the window? But no. She saw none and nothing. How about a priest, it would have done nothing. But a president roaming around their garden, what was it a sign of?There came many nights after that one and Lins mum begged her again to study her homeworks a bit harder. But Lin was in for politics and gave no damn about priests peeping through that magical windows, but -? She wanted to have the political feeling about it all. As a matter of fact she had turned over so much to her rational mind that she was clear about it in the end. The windows surface was shadowy and let lights play with the dark and the dark had games with the light. All this alltogether made sure that everything could turn a vision. Ever political leaders could dance on the edge of life to come around with messages. How about it? Through that mirror of it all? tslike your own face play on that glass of something. Like the glass hold a reflection and you become part of both projection and rejection and reflection. So? On and on the same game with the mysteries of projections. Is it on the surface or is it deeper into the windowy screen? Somewhere Lins mum had thoughts she gave to her children.Mum explained lots of stuff about magical windows where ghosts come to visit the family. There were of course several windows in the house, but the one in the kitchen was more of a wonder world os events. Ghosts came there. You could see both past and future things. You could imagine others thoughts and let them be played out in the open. As a matter of fact such a window gave a spirit to Lins family. As a matter of fact that family life gave the window a spirit and it gave room for more projections. As projection needs mirrors or windows Mankind became more open to playing out their fears as soon as the first house was built way back in the history, cause then the peeping Tom could begin. And as the peeper was out on run the more solutions Mankind needed. And the more questions was asked to the windows. Who there? Whats up? What is out there in the open? So Steeped in projections because of a window.Lin began picking her mums habit looking through that thing of a flat surface, the flattering visions the more the projections played and intermixed in her brain. That is how she came to be lostWindow window on the wall, tell me who I see today! Window windows call, tell me who I come to see! And yes, the very one who has ears to listen can shut the eyes and begin to hear so much more. Window window when its fall, fall all flocks of snow just fall!!!Through the window each season passed by. And as they all came and went so did ghost come to visit the house out in Tvelss. The small village with the most odd priest, and - ? Still Mrs John F Kennedy must have visited Lin and told her things. Many years after Lin could vividly remember his face but forgot all his words and even forgot his politics.Yeah, its true. Ghosts can be extremely spiritual, as they can be rational, visionary creatures through science, moody, awful, cruel, kind, debating, and: For sure there was Mr John F Kennedy coming through. He wanted to tell Lin about his woman affairs. However Lin said that no gossip of that sort could be listened too. Besides womans magazines were all over the world about fashion, kitchen work, cleaning and such. So in the end. Some nights after the first one: there he was again, as a huge flame on the window screen. Mr John F Kennedy. He gave space and time a new dimension. Perhaps he tried to have done so when alive. But now he wanted Lin to tell the world about his mission.Lin sat softly by that kitchen table many nights after the first one. And he, the president, brought her messages. One hint after the other. And when spring came Lin knew all aboit politicam mission.She was going to write a book about Radical thoughts. Thoughts that went to the core of the people because of propaganda. Was he killed because of it? Journalism tries to solve information when they are wrapped up in pr and not only that...Information is wrapped up in itself, like a reflection coming from a window of the past. Ghosts may belong to another dimension. Still they can listen to news everywhere. But how about a politician beginning adressing the information society as a threat? He would then become the target for journalism. Better then having a window in the kitchen and no TV screen. Too many projections out on the run, Macha,,,,?"
The best super hero duo,"For a moment, Sarah was so enchanted by the light of the moon and the hundred stars shining bright that she forgot about the darkness. The darkness of the night, of the room, and in her life. For a minute, everything seemed stone-still and pale. The silence lasted only a minute, which was interrupted by the mere-hooting of a tawny tiny owl on a nearby tree.Its large broad head, binocular vision, an upright stance, and sharp talons made it seem ominous and fearful to the world. But the baby owl thatd waited for hours seemed the happiest to be right next to its mother after so long. The big white owl fluffed out its feathers and seemingly hugged its little one staring out into the darkness of the night.Memories of the past flooded Sarahs thinking. The image of a tiny baby, pinkish-white in complexion and so small that he fit perfectly in Sarahs tiny arms. He was named . And the name suited him of all. She remembers the day he took his first steps right by the tree in the garden where the night owls rested now and the first day he called Sarah by her name. She remembers how happy she was and how she hugged him and kissed him and couldnt wait for Monday to tell all her friends at school about how her little brother called out her name for the first time ever. She remembers how shed stayed up all night the first time Jojo fell sick and over a hundred degrees. Shed replace the small white towel on his forehead every couple of minutes so that hed recover the soonest. Shed taught him how to ride a cycle, how to swim, and how to make an omelet when mom isnt around. She remembers the annual science day when Jojo got first place in his third grade and she cheered the loudest as he collected his shiny yellow ribbon on the stage.Hed always take two of everything. Two chocolates, two ice-creams, two t-shirts, two bicycles with matching helmets, and would ask for two wishes from God whenever he prayed. One for himself and the other for Sarah. He would never spend one day apart and always preferred to hear his bedtime stories from Sarah. He used to say Shed read to him the stories on Jack and the beanstalk, the tortoise and the hare, the ant and the grasshopper, the ugly duckling, the sleeping beauty, Aladdin, belling the cat, Hansel, and Gretel and a million more every single night before he went to bed. She would read a story beforehand and substitute the leading heros name of the plot with that of Jojos and he loved it!Hed form his own versions of Hansel and Gretel and would paint imaginary stories where its Sarah and Jojo against the world, battling all the evil and winning it all every single time. He even painted a picture of the duo with gold-colored capes, black sunglasses, a magic wand, and a shiny tiara made of diamonds for Sarah. He had put it up on the wall of his bedroom where the sunlight would hit the wall the first thing in the morning and hed wake up smiling. They were the best of friends, always together in spirit. Theyve seen the best and worst of each other and have stayed by each other through the darkest of days as well as the brightest of summers. She remembers all those countless fights over the toys that her parents bought them, as to who would keep the fire truck and who would have the airplane. Sarah loved the fire truck. Shed bring her tiny human figures and place them by the fire truck. Shed take the hose and pretend to put the fire off any building that was usually a book on the shelf. Sometimes shed save humans and sometimes shed save the animals. Jojo knew how much Sarah loved the fire truck and would always pick the airplane saying its the best though secretly he loved the fire truck more. If there was a synonym for inseparable, it would be Sarah-Jojo.Like they say  and that nothing lasts forever, this one had its time too.But never in a thousand years did Sarah think that it would happen this soon. She doesnt even have a picture with her brother in his graduation robes and a shiny certificate. Their dreams of going on a long drive with Jojo at the steering wheel and Sarah being the DJ for the day are now left incomplete. The plans they had about spending the summer working together on a community project helping the unfortunate kids are now shattered. All those tiny big dreams now lay stone white with the death of Jojo. It happened so suddenly that she could not even say her final goodbye.If she probably knew it earlier, shed have given him the warmest hug and the lightest kiss on his forehead. But it was now too late. She looked at the two white owls and wished for that one last hug, for that one last touch of care and pure love. For one last time, shed say I love you and for one last time, shed look at him smiling with all of his heart.Time flies when you peek into the memory lane and Sarah didnt even realize when the darkness of the night vanished with bright sunrays flooding her room. It was the community help day and she wouldnt be late. She dresses up and reaches the old church right by the end of their lane. Its already filled with a hundred little kids all over the place who come from less fortunate families. She starts distributing the items theyd collected the past week from each house in the area which composed of toys, warm clothes, faded shoes, used storybooks, and much more.She opens up the box shed bought from her basement to give the toys to the kids. A little boy with bright blue eyes and his cute sister with a pretty ponytail run right to her and hastily pick their toys from the box.The boy picks up the fire truck ecstatically and the girl takes the airplane but with a heavy heart and sad eyes as of a puppys. The little boy gives out a huge innocent smile and stretches out his hand giving his sister the fire truck and says"
Wild Goose Chase,"There was always something going on at Nannys house. At Christmas, she would organise a large family gathering with party games, including hitting a piata. Easter there would be a similar gathering, but with an Easter egg hunt in the garden.Between times there would be barbeques, or friends around. Whenever Amelia and Jake called to see her, she was busy doing something: baking, gardening, packing to go away, you just never knew with her. She lived alone with her two fluffy cats, Tiger and Lily, but it didnt mean that her house was quiet.Then lockdown happened and for most people life changed. It did for Amelia, no more school, Rainbows, parties or swimming lessons. Because Nanny lived on her own, Amelias family became her social bubble, which meant that they could still see each other. It did change what went on at Nannys, but it was still a busy house. Whenever Amelia and Jake visited there would be games of Britains Got Talent, Hide n Seek (which involved Nanny hiding in the bath, and Mummy getting in the wardrobe ), or the Queen game, when Nanny would be the queen and they would all ride in her carriage  the sofa. Some things like the gardening and baking continued in the same way, and others developed. For instance, Amelia and Nanny spent a morning making cakes. Then, they dressed up in party frocks and fascinators and invited Mummy and Jake round for a high tea. Or Nanny collected lots of cardboard boxes in the garage, and they used them to make things, or kick around the garden when they felt cross.	Sometimes, Amelia and Jake would stay with her for a sleepover. They slept in Nannys spare room, in the big bed with the sparkly duvet on. It was a long, narrow room, which stretched from the front to the back of the house. There were lots of interesting things in the drawers and wardrobe in this bedroom. One drawer held candles and torches, another was filled with Nannys old make up, yet another had miniatures ofshampoo and shower gel in, which Nanny said that she had bought back from the hotels where shed stayed over the years. She did have some rules, you were allowed to look at and touch whatever you wanted, but when you had finished you must put it back where you had found it, and you mustnt break anything.	One of the sleepovers was to be very special. Amelia and Jakes cousin, Nicholas was going to stay too. Amelia was six years old, Nicholas five, and Jake three, so they played together well, although the boys fought sometimes. Nanny had made a bed from the cushions off the sofa in the spare room for Nicholas. Everyone was excited; they started the evening with Amelias favourite dinner, fish fingers and chips, followed by ice cream. Then, they had their baths, one after the other. Nanny let them choose what bubble bath they wanted from her drawer of miniatures. After that the four of them, Nanny included, sat in her big bed watching Sooty and Sweep on her laptop. This was another of Nannys rules, she didnt put the TV on unless you were going to sit and watch it, and you didnt play on her laptop, phone or iPad, they were all for finding out about things. Tiger and Lily came and sat in the bedroom with them. Finally, Nanny said that it was time for bed, and she took the three of them into the spare bedroom, although she knew they wouldnt sleep.	The children were delighted; Nanny had laid out dishes with sweets in for them to have a midnight feast. It wasnt quite midnight yet, but it felt late to the children. There were bowls of marshmallows, Haribous, smarties and chocolate buttons. They had a lovely time, jumping on the beds, looking in all Nannys drawers and playing super heroes. Occasionally, she would put her head around the door and say.	Calm down. Youre getting too noisy. Until eventually, she came in and said.	Time to settle down now. Into bed you three. She tucked them into their beds, kissed each of them on the head, turned off the light and left. Amelia had other ideas. She liked looking out of the back window in this room. From here, you could look over the neighbours back gardens, and more interestingly you could watch the people walking up and down the alley, which ran next to Nannys house. In day time, you could see people walking their dogs, children riding bikes and people pushing prams, and all the time they wouldnt know that you were there. She dragged the dressing table chair to the window, and stood on it. Parting the curtains, she looked out. It looked quite different at night. The gardens were dark and still, she could see the street lights glowing in the nearby streets, and the sparkling stars and moon in the inky black sky. Nicholas wanted to look.	In a minute. You can have a turn when Ive finished.	Suddenly, she saw movement. It was a girl of about her age walking down the alley. She was dressed in a Minnie Mouse onesie, and had a Bing Bunny under her arm. Amelia told Nicholas what she could see, and quick as a flash, he was up on Amelia and Jakes bed, parting the front curtains and peering out the front window.	Shes crossing the road.	Lets follow her. She may be in danger.	Quick as a flash, the trio left the bedroom. A brief glance into Nannys room showed them that although her light was on, she was lying in bed, on her back with an open book on her chest, gently snoring. Quietly as they could, they went down the stairs to the front door, and put their shoes on. (Another of Nannys rules: take your shoes off as you come into the house. So, there was always a pile of shoes by the front door). Amelia unlocked and opened the door. Jake took one look, and then headed back up the stairs, saying.	Dark, no go.	Amelia and Nicholas left the house, gently shutting the door behind them. There was no sign of the girl who theyd had seen from the bedroom. Across the road, diagonally opposite Nannys house, sat Tinkerbell. She was a neighbours friendly cat. She beckoned the children over the road. 	Come on you two. Its this way.	Amelia looked at Nicholas, and asked. Did she just speak? His eyes wide in astonishment he nodded in answer. The children held hands, looked both ways in case any cars were coming and crossed to Tinkerbell.	Go down there. She said, pointing with her paw down the footpath, which ran down beside her house. Make for the school, and then go down to the river. Amelia knew the way well enough. She used to go to school every day, but that seemed a long time ago. Still holding hands, the children hurried along the path between the houses. It led to a car park by some flats. They were surprised to see other children heading in the same direction. They were all dressed for bed, some walked alone, others in twos or threes. There were also cats and a few dogs, all walking quietly and purposefully towards the river. Past the dark outline of the school they all went, its gates locked and playground empty. Their numbers growing as they got closer to the river. Through the last cul-de-sac of houses, until the path opened out to a grassy slope, and Amelia could see where they were all headed. It was the childrens play area between the school and the river. There was a crowd of children and animals gathered there, and more were heading towards it. It was noisy now too, as children recognised their friends and exclaimed in surprise that they were also be out at night. More surprisingly, the animals were talking too, not in barks and meows, but real understandable words. Suddenly, there was a hush; a large cat had jumped up onto the middle of the climbing frame. Amelia squinted from her place at the back of the crowd. She recognised him, it looked like Nannys Tiger. Yes, it definitely was, because at the bottom of the frame, weaving her way, restlessly in and out of the bars was Lily, and the two were rarely apart.	Thank you all for coming. It was Tiger, he was speaking loudly and confidently. As you all know, we are going through strange times. A disease called coronavirus is making many humans ill.	It wasnt us, it wasnt us. This was a rustling, whisper, which came from an odd group of animals who were hanging upside down by their feet from the zip wire. They were about the size of mice, but had leathery wings wrapped like cloaks around themselves. Amelia recognised them, they were bats.	And it certainly wasnt us. This came from two animals, which were unfamiliar to Amelia. They were sitting side by side on the roundabout, and were the size of small dogs. She could see fur sprouting from their undersides, but most of their bodies were covered in what looked like small tiles. It looked like they were wearing armour. They had long pointed faces and bright beady eyes, and long thick tails. Later, she discovered that they were rare pangolins.	We are not here to blame anyone. Tiger continued confidently. We are here because we are worried. Humans are dying, everyone is shut in, and no-one can enjoy all the things that they used to do. Tonight, I propose that we go on a fact finding mission, to see what we can find out. There were cries of Hear, hear from the cats.	The birds have kindly agreed to carry some children to other places, to see exactly what is going on in the world, and report back to us. Id like some volunteers, children who are brave, and not afraid of flying. Immediately, Amelias hand went up, she had always wanted an adventure. She looked around her, and could see a spattering of hands up around her, including Nicholas.	Thank you. Okay I want everyone, especially us cats, to leave the play area and gather by the school fence. Only the volunteers stay here Tiger leapt down from the climbing frame and trotted out off towards the school, leading all of the other animals, and most of the children away.About twenty children were left, Amelia recognised some of them, including Poppy who lived in the same road as Nanny, and her boyfriend from school, Lenny. They waved shyly at each other. Suddenly from above there was a sharp breeze and a loud flapping sound, as the largest bird that Amelia had ever seen landed above the children on the swings frame. She thought it was an eagle.	Right, I want you all to space out. The boys are coming in to land. Obediently the children moved apart. There was a great commotion above them, as a great flock of birds appeared and flew down, each settling near a child. Amelia noticed that the eagle had moved towards Nicholas, next to her a great, grey goose had landed.	Hello, Im Griselda. Whats your name? Amelia answered the goose, who went on to explain to her how to climb up on to her back, and that she need only to grip on tightly as they took off and landed, otherwise the flight would be quite smooth. Around her, other birds were taking off with children on their backs. Once, Amelia was settled, Griselda said.	Ready. And she could feel the birds powerful muscles move beneath her as she began to flap her wings, and used her yellow legs and webbed feet to leap up towards the sky. Up they flew, Griselda pointing her head and stretching her neck upwards, great wings moving backwards and forwards. Amelia leaned forward, lay flat along the birds back and looped her arms around the birds long neck. Griselda issued a few load honks and immediately they were surrounded by other geese, all honking in greeting at each other. They fell into a v formation, Griselda and Amelia at the front. When Griselda had reached the level that she wanted, and her wings had settled into a steady, effortless beating, she said.	Were headed to Oxford. They flew through the night sky. Far below her Amelia could see rows of twinkling street lights, dark silhouettes of buildings and trees, and areas changing as they flew, sometimes hills or flat fields, other times vast built up areas with streets of houses and high rise flats with the odd square of light in a window. After what seemed no time at all, the geese began to slow, and Amelia could see that they were approaching a great city. It had many spires and towers piercing the sky line, and Griselda skilfully flew between them. The rest of the flock had disappeared. The goose circled around, apparently looking for something. Finally, she found it. It was a modern group of office buildings, and although it was late at night the lights were on. As they approached, Amelia could see people in white coats, hard at work in laboratories. Griselda landed by an entrance, and said In you go. Amelia slid off her back, and rather doubtfully pushed open the double doors. Before her there was a long corridor with doors leading off it. Hesitantly, she began walking down the long hallway. She could hear voices. It was two women, one was saying.	Yes, we have found a vaccination. If we give people this, it will stop the spread of the virus and protect them. She knew that this was what she had been sent to find out. Joyfully, she turned around and headed back to Griselda. Carefully, climbing back onto the birds back, she waited until they were airborne and flying steadily before she shared what she had heard. The rest of the flock had re-joined them, and they were heading back to the playground.	Good news indeed. commented Griselda. It seemed to take even less time to fly back. The great goose landed, and Amelia again slid from her back. This time, she went to the birds head, thanked her and kissed her goodbye. She stood sadly watching as Griselda flapped her wings, and took to the sky. When she was high up, Amelia saw the rest of the flock re-appear and the birds fly off together. For a moment she felt lonely, but all around her other birds were landing, and children were jumping off their backs on to the ground. When all the birds had gone, Tiger led the main group back to the playground, and gracefully jumped back up onto his place at the top of the climbing frame. He asked each of the volunteers in turn to tell the gathering what he or she had seen. Some children had seen some terrible things, such as people dying without doctors to help them. Others had visited countries where life appeared to be carrying on as normal. Nicholas had been to Germany where he had seen a scene similar to the one that Amelia had witnessed. Finally, it was Amelias turn, and she told the meeting about the scientists finding a vaccination, which would protect humans against coronavirus.	Then we must convince all grown- ups to have the injection. After all, I get taken to the vets every year to have my jab. This was from Tiger, who then said.	Now, everyone back to bed. Remember not a word to anyone, but tell all adults to have their vaccination. Amelia took Nicholas hand and turned to walk back home. There, on the edge of the crowd, she saw Nanny and Jake. After they had left the house, Jake had run upstairs and woken Nanny. She had followed the animals and children to the play area, where she had watched the whole thing. She was cross, as she led the children back to her house she said.	You must never, ever leave the house again without telling Nanny. And as for that cat, you wait till I get my hands on him. Of course, Ill have my vaccination, does he think that I want to be ill!"
It didn't happen.,"There comes a time in every girl's life where they stumble upon Pinterest and get the urge to move their entire bed frame to sit right under the window. And it's almost always worth it. And usually during the day time alone, I would lie on my bed, watch out the window and take a power nap in the afternoon. But for the first time ever, I decided stupidly, to experience night life. I was going to stay up past midnight. This was not because of teenage rebellion 'I'm gonna stay up in the night because my parents didn't want me to.'No.I usually fall asleep pretty quickly in the night so I downed some Coffee in the evening time.  Now this is a true story.That night I was feverishly typing on my laptop's keys trying to get work done. It was Exam time and I was dedicated to being the valedictorian of the school. Alright, well I didn't want to start off this story with a lie but my fingers typed it for me.  That night I was feverishly binging episodes from my favourite youtuber while procrastinating the fact that I had upcoming exams. I'm not a horrible student but I just didn't feel like studying. It was almost midnight as well. I opened the windows for once in my life. I always had the irrational fear that someone would come up to the window and look at me while I'm sleeping. I would always push it aside tonight because my room is not ground level. If someone were to casually come up to my window and take a gander, they would have to levitate.But tonight, all those fears were pushed aside. I was wrapped in my blanket and although everyone in the house had fallen asleep, I felt safe. I felt so safe that my toes peeked out of the blanket.I wanted the night vibe to whisk me off to dreamland. Through my video, I heard a 'pstttt' sound.I chose to ignore it the first time.That didn't happen, it was my imagination.Then it happened a few more times.I knew in the back of my mind, it was coming from the window but I decided to not immediately look at the window. I was doing that 'look all around the room' schtick just wanting to believe it was something else. . We didn't have a cat but it could be a cat.Exhausting all my options, I decided to take a peek and then run like hell. What I expected was a man to right up on my window sill gazing at me with wide open eyes and a creepy smile on his face.In my mind, that was my fear, I was prepared for it. Had a little bat near my bed, just casually pick that up and casually slam it directly into his face. I didn't get that.  What I didn't expect was to see the open window of the neighbouring house. The light was on in the front room illuminating everything except the man himself. He was a darkened figure obviously looking into my room.Once more making the sound, confirming it was him. My heart dropped.I was expecting something, but I didn't expect me to be right. I'm almost never right.I wished it was like those sitcoms where the character thought he saw something and it just turned out to be something else that's not at all scary.It wasn't.No matter if I was to write this from a 3rd Version point of view were I analyze his feelings and thoughts into the story. It would still be the same. An unknown man was looking into my bedroom, trying to call my attention and talk to me. And he was getting frustrated thinking I was ignoring him.Well, I was.But I didn't want him to think so. I wanted him to think that I was just busy and that I had not heard him. That I was deaf or something.Thinking about it more, he wasn't unknown, I could remember waving to a guy now and then just for politeness sake. He would be next door, not a part of the household but over there enough to probably stay over some nights.  Knowing it was a man watching me, I did the only thing I could think of. Shut the windows and close the curtains. Now I see why people stupidly die in horror movies.Shock makes you do stupid things. I could have woke up my parents,I could have called the police on a peeping tom.I could have slept in the living room that night. But instead I closed the windows and laid on the bed, blocking the brightness of the screen pretending that I had just gone to sleep.I peeked once more to check if he was still there and he was.Just sitting this time. It was  harder to take a picture as I could only see the top of his head concealed by dark.He was no longer standing and pressing the entire top portion of his body to the glass. I rolled over and continued to watch my video.It didn't happen. The night ended and morning came. I was awaken by a familiar sound. Tic.... Tic.... Tic...It was getting louder as I lifted my head. I knew it as the sound of  pebbles hitting my window. That only happens when someone would be cutting grass with the 'Weedeater' machine. It's humming would usually be in the morning so I didn't find it strange. However, the humming of the machine wasn't there.Like an idiot, I peered out. I saw the facial features of the man. It was the man I would wave to out of politeness sake. He was throwing pebbles, trying to get my attention. My parents weren't home this time, my dad would usually drive her to work. Curious... I opened the window."
The Present Impossibility of Amphibian to Human Transformations,"Princess Literella heard an urgent knocking on her window, a sharp rat-a-tat sound, the kind that might be made using long and pointy nails. She sat up in bed, pulling the soft woollen covers up to her chin, and listened.Rat-a-tat, there it was again. A shiver ran up her spine. Being a princess and all, she knew she had to be careful with strangers at her window late at night. And where were her guards, she mused, who would usually spring into action and ward off unknowns?Nevertheless, her heart did skip a beat when she thought someone may have arrived with a new frog. A frog that she could kiss, that would become her prince.Now all of this had started a long time ago.*Once upon a time, there lived a princess called Literella, in a kingdom far, far away. Literella was the only daughter of King Polonius and Queen Moderna and they raised her with the greatest love and care two parents could bestow on a little girl. And given their royal status, they were able to shower her with the type of extraordinary riches that the hoi polloi could scarce afford.The little princess wore a crown of rubies, and little anklets of gold. Her arms were adorned with diamond bracelets. Whatever she wanted, she got. And thus she grew up to be a very spoilt little girl.When she was two, the first fairy tale the King read to her was The Frog Prince. Literella was enchanted with the tale. As soon as the King finished, she clapped her hands and said, Again! So the King read the tale again. And then she cried, Again! After the third reading the King was tired. He was contemplating a war with the neighboring kingdom, and whether to raise taxes on the feudal lords. He had neither time nor patience to read The Frog Prince a fourth time.Time for bed, Literella, he said, and blew out her candle. As he left, he could hear the princess sobbing into the arms of her lady-in-waiting, begging for another reading of the story.As the years passed, the King and Queen hired the best tutors to begin educating Literella on the fine arts of public affairs, politics and history, the management of the royal household and the best modes of charity. But Literella never forgot The Frog Prince. Every night, she would pull out her dog eared edition of Grimms Fairy Tales, and read the tale.When she was twelve, much to the King and Queens consternation, she declared, I need to find my own Frog Prince.And what do you mean by that, my dear? said the Queen.Im looking for the Prince who's trapped inside a frog of course, Mother, said Literella.Thats just a fairy tale darling, said the Queen, shooting the King a meaningful look for some support.What do you mean, Mother? said Literella.Well, not everything you read in books is true, said the Queen. After all, have you ever seen a Prince emerge from a frog?Well, weve never seen God either, and yet we pray to him all the time, said Literella.She has a point there, said the King, unhelpfully.Really? said the Queen, flashing him a look of annoyance. Dont you have a war to fight, dear?*Word of Literellas obsession with a frog prince spread far and wide. The palace was inundated with merchants, peasants, hunters and lords, all carrying frogs. Literella had been used to getting her way for a long time, and she insisted on turning no frog away.If you stop me, I will stop eating,"" she threatened, adding, ""Father, Mother, this is my future husband were talking about.Yes, we know, they said despondently to their headstrong, twelve year old child.The Queen turned to the King. ""What shall we do?"" she whispered.The King was the chief spoiler of children. ""She's just a little girl with a wild imagination,"" he said. ""It's harmless, she'll outgrow it in time.""And so they watched her traipse off to her sitting room and receive frog bearers one by one. Each would hold their frog in front of her, arms outstretched. Then Literella would close her eyes tight, pucker her lips and kiss the little creature, only to frighten it half out of its mind. At this point, if the frog hadnt already jumped clean out of the palm of its owner and escaped, Literella would insist it be released into the Royal Pond.The Royal Pond became overpopulated with frogs. The kingdom's snakes were going hungry. And everybody was laughing at Literella.As usual, the King turned over the more intractable problems to the Queen.Here, he said. You handle this. After all, youre the one who brought her up this way. He loved to foist the blame on her for his own transgressions. Then he got on his horse and said he was going hunting.In despair, the Queen approached the Royal Wizardess. Wizardess, I need your good counsel. The situation with Literella is literally out of control, said the Queen.Indeed it is, said the Wizardess. And I know just what to do. Leave it all to me.*That night, encouraged by the possibility of her frog prince, Literella ran to her window and pulled open the curtain. It was a moonless night, and all Literella could see was the silhouette of a hunchback. In his palm he held the most exotic frog. It glowed green with red stripes. She peered closely into the window to see the hunchback's face. He looked like he was a hundred years old, with a deeply lined face, and sunken eyes. He held up a thin finger and gestured to her to open her window.Literella looked behind to see if any of the palace guards were around. There was no one. What luck, she thought to herself. She opened her window, and before she knew it, the hunchback had jumped into her room.Princess, do you want to kiss this frog? he asked in a thin, quavering voice.Yes, she said. I do!Now, remember, said the hunchback, Once a Prince emerges you must marry him. You may not complain he is not to your liking.But arent all Princes wonderful? asked Literella.All their find them wonderful, of  we can be sure, said the hunchback. And then he cackled, a high pitched whining laugh, and Literella was suddenly very afraid. For the first time, she wasnt sure she wanted to kiss the frog at all.How do you know this? asked Literella.Because  was a prince once, and my mother  thought  was wonderful, said the hunchback.At this Literella shrank back in fear. The hunchback, a prince? He didnt look like any of the princes in her picture book. What if she kissed this frog, and he turned into a hunchback prince? What would she do then?I dont think Im going to kiss this frog, she said, stepping back.Ive come all this way and brought a very special frog for you, said the hunchback. You cannot refuse. He held out the green and red frog to her, and the little creature seemed to peer at her hopefully.But I can, she said, and stamped her foot.No, you cannot, said the hunchback. Except under one condition.Anything, she said. She was now mortally scared of being betrothed to a hunchback prince for life. (This is unfortunate, but hunchback princes were really not very popular.)If you refuse to kiss this frog, you must promise to never go looking for a frog prince again, said the hunchback.Never! she agreed readily, breathing a huge sigh of relief.The hunchback put the frog into his pocket. Then he placed one leg over the window sill, and then the other and disappeared into the black night.Outside the palace walls, the Wizardess found him and gave him twenty silver coins.She then said, Ill take the frog, please. Hell live in the Royal Pond. A good reminder. And then she laughed, a hearty, wicked laugh.*The next day, the Princess awoke and declared she was done with seeking out Frog Princes. The Queen was overjoyed. The King returned from his hunt. The green and red frog croaked in the Royal Pond.On the Wizardesss recommendation, the King and Queen hired a Science Tutor for Literella. One of the first lessons they covered was, The Present Impossibility of Amphibian to Human Transformations.Literella still read The Frog Prince again from time to time.

calypse,"shes putting up her clothes when her brother walks into the room, but he doesnt say anything, just picks up a hanger from her bed and twists it around and around until its not a hanger, not a shape at all, anymore. she wants to ask if hes okay but she knows the answer is a solid and so she chomps down over her bottom lip and her top teeth stick out like they belong to a rabbit, or a hamster, or a very old man named hector. her brother takes the hanger and wraps the wire, now wasted and outstretched, around his wrist once, twice, three times and then he looks up at his sister. she smiles and her teeth fade back into her mouth, back into the neat rows her braces worked so hard to achieve.are you okay?he shakes his head, no, are you?and she takes the unraveled hanger off his wrist and shakes her head too so now theyre sitting in silence, but the silence is louder than any words or any songs or movies or plays or the sound of crickets outside. in the silence, they both hear too much.do you want to go get food?im not really hungry right now.i know, but you should still eat something. i can drive.she laughs and then realizes he was serious, even though hes barely old enough to sit in the front seat, much less actually drive the vehicle. you cant, its not allowed.and whats allowed, then? who makes the rules?she doesnt know.i do. ill make the rules.then let me drive?she nods. its not like shes in any shape to drive them anywhere. ok. this time only, though. next time, ill drive us there, wherever that is. what do you want to eat, though?i dont know, what do we have money for?let me check.she gets up and walks into the next room, takes the drawer from her mothers dresser and pours out the contents on the bed. theres plenty of jewelry, but she doesnt want to sell it yet. she paws through the tangled necklaces and janky rings until she finds what shes looking for, wrapped with a pink rubber band and hidden in a mens sport sock.there are two one hundred dollar bills.she thought there would be more.lets go get sushi! she decides before her brother, always more logical, could object. there was no real money for them to buy sushi, especially not now when the prices were so high and mighty, but she wanted sushi and it was one of the only things she wanted that she could have. go get in the car, she calls into the next room, and ill be right there.okay, sounds like a plan! her brother walks into the garage and hears the door closing behind him. when shes sure hes gone, she folds the money into tight squares and tucks them into her shirt, beside her small knife and the bigger one, too. money and knives and sushi. that could be her autobiographys name, she supposes, if she ever makes it to a place with paper, a computer, pens, whatever she needs to write again. but writing is the least of her concerns at the moment. there are bigger fish to fry, and they are knocking at her window as she turns towards the garage, ready to join her brother in their (perhaps futile) search for sushi. the knives bounce against her stomach as she walks and she is glad she wrapped them so well, but its the irony she finds in something so sharp bouncing along almost that makes her smile. shes still smiling when she gets to the car.and then she stops smiling.her brother isnt where he should be, not sitting in the drivers seat of the car her parents gave her on her seventeenth birthday, three months before they-her brother isnt where he should be.where are you?she opens the car door.this isnt funny-theres still no one there.you have three seconds before i get in this car and lock the doors, videri.videri does not answer. she climbs into the car and locks the door. the keys were in her brothers pocket, therefore she cant do a thing but sit there and wait to see if hes coming back or if he, like her parents, is gone. not dead. gone. and not disappeared, either, because she knows where they went. rather, she knows what theyve become.theres a knock at the window, and then, before she can duck, the glass shatters.she scrambles, feeling the sharpness and the blood against her face, her hands and neck, seeping through her top, a shirt gifted to her by someone she loved. the content dog, once a light brown, now seems to snarl through red, coppery stained teeth. she cant do anything about it because shes not thinking about her ruined clothes or the glass in her hands; shes not thinking of the crunch she heard from her fingers as she moved too quickly, how they bended too far back, hung in angles too sharp and yet, like overcooked pasta, stuck to the seats of the car if she left them there too long. shes not thinking of the inevitable, shes processing what she should do next, and shes climbing over the piles of junk in her car. theres a jar of mixed nuts- one that brought a lot of jokes from her less mature friends- and a gym bag full of horrific smelling attire. she doesnt laugh at the mixed nuts and she ignores the smell of her sweaty socks for the overbearing smell of fear, stemming from the gristly face staring back at her through the window.it looks like her brother, but its not.its hands claw, curled, through the gaping, glass-less hole where the window used to be stationed, and she has to scoot backwards quickly to avoid being further ribboned, further sliced into long, apple and potato skin pieces. she feels tears start to drizzle her cheeks, mixing with the blood swishing like paint down the roof and walls of her body, but they too go unnoticed entirely. she can be sad, she tells herself, if shes not dead or-well. she can only cry if shes alive to do it, so she continues towards the back of the car and then, as best she can, squeezes herself into a roly poly shell of a person, her hands making rice crispy noises under the weight of her body and her bones, knees and ankles and shoulders, joining in that painful chorus. in the dark between the outside world and the cocoon she has made for herself, this split second between alive and not, she can hear someone calling her name.she keeps her head down and she doesnt answer and she feels her heart catching in her throat and for a moment she wants to look up and see her brother, his kind of sad eyes but mostly amused smile, looking back at her but and if thats the last thing she remembers, that will be enough.she never should have sent him to the garage on his own, that was her first mistake. she should have known there would be someone out here, someone waiting to snag another innocent body and turn them, almost all at once, into a creature only recognizable in flesh but never, not ever, in mind in heart or in soul.theres a minute now where she imagines herself to be somewhere else, somewhere peaceful on a beach or an island or maybe a beach on an island but as long as its far from here and as long as its safe, she doesnt care. it doesnt matter because she is where she is but just for that minute, the while that lasts a second too short, she is safe. her family is a family and she is eating sushi and there are not two knives and two one hundred dollar bills pressed into her ribcage.another window breaks above her. before she can uncurl and get her knives, there is a hand and it reaches towards her and tears at her hair, yanking her upwards and through the window and then the cement of the garage is cold underneath her, scalding and freezing all at once. there is the face of her brother, the monster he has become, in her view and his teeth are so sharp she cant imagine him any other way and this, she realizes, is good because she cant kill him by remembering who he was. in order to remember him way, she has to-she tears the knife from the careful wrapping and clutches it between her fingers, the ones of the hand she hadnt crushed easily as peanut butter crackers in the bottom of a suitcase, and she steps forward.you wanted me to make the rules? ok. ill make the rules. you hide, and ill find you.she stabs her knife into the creatures left shoulder, the one that, when belonging to her brother, she used to cry and laugh on, with, for. as the knife plunges, she doesnt expect blood. she expects a shudder and maybe a second to run away, but she doesnt expect this monster to blink up at her with familiar eyes and then, all of a sudden, sit down in a heap.videri? she holds her hands out. her brother blinks again and holds his shoulder.theres in the midst of and she wants her brother back but then, before she can help him off the ground, the monster is back and it whips a leg around and kicks her in the shins and she stops herself before falling, grabbing her second knife and slicing underneath the first one, making two holes where there was one. the monsters eyes are blank again. she grabs both of the knives and pulls them together, creating one hole again and this one is bigger and the monster howls, backing up into the wall of the garage.she slams the monsters head into the shelf, one filled with fishing poles and old albums that their parents used to play on anniversaries and other special occasions but mostly left in the garage to rot because, as they said, this was not the age for records and their adjacent players. the monster stops moving. she unhooks the key ring from the pants its wearing and she scrambles back into the car, broken windows and fingers and heart and all."
A lifetime,"This was where I got my first kiss, just before he fell on Ma's aloe Vera plant trying to flee the uninspected intruder into my room. That night, the moon was as bright as today and the stars as twinkling as my eyes each time I saw himWilliam.Thinking of it again, this window has been my greatest and most silent witness in the past years. I had some of my happiest, saddest and funniest moments right here. With the sun illuminating my smile in day times, and the moon hiding my tears at night. I watched my dad leave by this window. Just after another dispute with ma. He had come home drunk with his salary half cut out again. He walked to his motorcycle, and all I wished was for him to turn once, only once to give me a smile, an ''I will be back'' smile but he didn't.He had gone many times, but this time he didn't come back. I was still six years old and Abouem was just a baby, but it feels like yesterday. Sometimes later, we heard about his wedding and his new babies  the brothers I never knew. Here, I admired the fireworks in the new year, right after we prayed with ma and Abouem for a better year. There's something about these sparkling whizzes that filled me with hope and a positive clairvoyance. I wrote my best stories here too. Painting on the dim blank sky the fruits of my imagination. I sometimes thought it would be great if there was a thought recorder. Genuine thoughts tend to go faster, but the real challenge here is to recognize them. It taught me how to listen to silence and just admire the moment. How to feel nature communicate with us through the wind brushing your skin, the unrehearsed concerts of birds and insects, and the scattered but yet peaceful movements of the clouds  the things we take for granted but which are some of the most beautiful signatures of mother nature. I applied to hundreds of opportunities here. It was the first to celebrate my successful replies, and also the first to collect my tears in cases of redirecting replies. It gave my room some light when we had no electricity. Not because ma did not pay, no, but due to the countless rolling blackouts we had. That was the bill she paid off first. We could go for months without subscribing to TV streaming services but we would always stay in light. Ma said light gives hope, that it is hope. At this window, Abouem and I had our best karaokes. We would sing so loud that the neighbors would start shouting for us to stop. I remember the days when we had nothing to eat. We would wait for Ma here till evening. We told each others stories until we got tired and just listened to music.Abouem would run as fast as Usain Bolt the instant she saw Ma coming. She came with either cooked food or groceries, but we loved the cooked food better than having to cook everything. I found out about dad's death by this window too. I was standing here when a middle aged woman parked her car by the house. She was accompanied by a man in a suit who was apparently her lawyer. Ma answered the knocked door and some minutes later, I heard loud voices. When I went to the living room I heard the man in suit talking about the house. How it didn't belong to us but to my dad's 'legal' wife. The woman who was very pretty and looked so nice was actually one who wanted two kids and their mother out of 'her' house. She didn't mind their living conditions or if the kids were her late husband's children. They gave us a week to move out and when ma followed her for more explanations, she turned and pushed her on the floor. I learned a lot about self control that day. Ma was very still. A week later, we moved to Baya's house. Ma did not want to start any legal procedure. She said it would certainly cost more than renting a little apartment for a year.Baya was my favorite opponent. We fought for the first position at school every sequence, but preferred to see the other in this position than any other classmate.Our mothers were very good friends. They were the only single mothers in our street. We stayed with them for two weeks, until we found a place. On my way back to school, I could not hold myself from staring at my room. I wondered who stayed in there and the possible links they may start to build with the house. We learned to accept our new conditions. Abouem better than I did. I understood why we were all different. Your dad proposed to me by this window. Just before telling me he bought this house for us. He always said that he got his best teenage memory in this place. When he kissed me and later fell on Ma's aloe Vera plant. You surely do not understand all that I'm telling you now, or maybe, but I am happy to share them all with you. I've had a lot of memories here. The best being your coming into our lives. I'll plant roses down your window, so their delightful smell wipes out any scent of sorrow, and their vivid colors brighten up your days. I hope you will not kiss a boy any time soon, because it would be unfortunate to have him crush the beautiful flowers. Now it is your window, and I pray that your memories here are far more beautiful and enriching than mine. That you sing as loud as you can, as long as we do not get any fine and it makes your eyes shine. May the love we have for you accompany you every single night and stand by you in every single fight."
Midnight Sun,"Insomnia had reared it's ugly head once again.  Was it just her or did others have this same issue.     Lately it seemed to be happening more often.  It was getting old and very annoying.  Was no fun losing sleep as her doctor kept telling her how important it was to get a good night's sleep for your health.     If that was true he should have prescribed a sleeping aid for her.  Instead here she was once again.  The clock is ticking at midnight and she finds herself sitting at her window looking out into the dark of night at her sleeping neighorhood.  She was jealous.     Something seemed different about this night.  It wasn't just looking at the moon and stars.  The shadows were not still.  They seemed to be moving.     Then her eyes had done a doubletake.  They told her that the apparent shadows were not shadows at all.  It alleared that someone in the apartment across the parking lot was moving out.  But why move in the middle of the night.     This night the moon seemed to be hiding so she could not tell who was leaving.  Guess she would find out in the morning.       Thank goodness she was retired and did not have to be at work.  So if she ever fell asleep she would be able to sleep in.  After watching for a while she decided to try to sleep again.  Thankfully she went to sleep quickly.     For some reason when she awakened the next day she went right to the window to look out.  To her surprise there were four police cruisers across the parking lot.     After she fixed herself a cup of coffee she returned to her window to see what was happening.  For almost an hour she watched.  Suddenly it struck her that it was at the same apartment she had watched last night.  Was there a connection?  Should she walk over and check or mind her own business?     She had opted for minding her own business.     Just about noon her friend Lois arrived for their daily coffee and game show.     ""Hey!  Did you hear what happened across the way?""     ""What do you mean what happened?""     ""The Johnsons have been on vacation.  Their grandson has been feeding their fish every other day.  When he came this morning he found the apartment trashed and the balcony door wide open.""     ""Wow.  When did it happen?""     ""Had to have been one of the past two nights.""     Her mouth dropped open in shock.  Had she seen it without knowing?     ""Last night I thought I was someone mmoving out over there.""     ""What?  That could have been the rats ripping off the Johnsons.  Did you tell anyone?""     ""Tell them what.  I am not really sure what I saw.""     ""I know but it is entirely possible you are a witness.""     ""Don't these apartments have security cameras?  Can't they just roll the tape?""     ""Any criminal case benefits if there are witnesses.  You might be needed if they ever catch these guys.""     ""Lois, you watch too many CSI reruns.""     ""Seriously.  You should let the police know what you might have seen.""     ""The coffee is ready.  I'll get you a cup while get the tv tuned to The Price Is Right.""     Nothing more was said about the previous night's event until her friend was on her way out the door.     ""You really should let the police know the time at least.  It could be important.""     All she could think of was if the police needed any help they would ask.     When bedtime rolled around again she could not sleep.  She kept thinking about the night before.  Needless to say, after glancing at her clock which glowed midnight, she once again found heerself looking out her window.  Everything seemed pretty quiet.     Then she saw what looked like the same u-haul van from the previous night slowly moving across the parking lot with no headlights on.  Could it be the same one?  Maybe she should call the police just to be on the safe side.     This time she decided that is what she should do.  Within ten minutes police cruisers had the van surrounded.  One officer came to her apartment to thank her for being so alert.  Seems it was a group that had been breaking into apartments where the occupants were away.  Nobody had been able to catch them until now.     That made her feel pretty good.  She had helped stop a small crime wave.  It made her want to sit up at night to keep an eye on  her neighbors.     For two nights in a row nothing extraordinary seemed to happen.  She did see the Becton boys sitting at the community picnic table smoking.  She wondered if their parents knew.     During the next few days she felt like this had become her new regular routine.  Rather than even try to go to sleep at bedtime she would sit in her darkened room in front of her window and watch.     She began to notice that there was other activity.  The usual, except for the fact that it was the middle of the night, taking trash to the dumpster and those Becton boys out smoking.     Then Mister Acton began leaving his apartment just before midnight.  The older couple, the Klines, seemed to like taking their walks in the dark.     Another night she saw the college boys across from the Johnsons throwing a party.  She thought it was going to last all night but it wound down shortly after midnight.     She learned who had a dog that needed to go out during the night.  She saw who stayed up after midnight and did not turn out their light.  But it seemed odd to her that nobody left an outside light on all night.     After almost two weeks with no unusual activity she decided to go to sleep at a normal hour.     Which worked.  She fell asleep shortly after retiring for the night.  It did not last long as just before midnight she was awakened by the sound of sirens.  They seemed to be getting pretty close.     She found herself looking out her window at midnight again as the EMS stopped at the apartment below the college boys.  If she remembered right, that was old man Parker's place.  His heart must be giving him issues again.     For the three years she had lived in her apartment she had thought it was in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood.  There was more action under the Midnight Sun then she ever imagined."
The Town,"Once upon a time, there was a man who entered a small town named Robbinsville. It was a town hidden away from society, not a lot of people were aware of it, nor did they know where it was located. It was an incredibly quiet town where everything was organized. Every morning the people would wake up, brush their teeth, take a shower, eat breakfast, and go to school or work at the same time and when they came home, they would eat dinner, brush their teeth, and go to bed all at the same time. They all had the same soap, same toothbrush, etc. They all sounded the same and wore the same clothing. Women would wear a simple gray dress and men would wear a gray shirt with gray pants. Everything in the town was one solid color gray. The man was not aware of this. He was traveling and had gotten lost when he stumbled upon the town. Being that he did not know where he was, he decided to stay in the town for at least 3 days to rest and get some direction. When he entered, he got a weird vibe from the town but decided to ignore it, it did confuse him that everything was gray but shrugged it off. He stopped one of the townsmen on the street and asked for directions towards a motel. The man looked at him for a couple of seconds then pointed in direction of one and continued what he was doing. The man nodded a thank you and headed in that direction. On his way to the motel, he looked around he noticed that everyone was in gray. From men to women to even their children. He stuck out like a sore thumb in his blue jeans and black sweater. He picked up the pace and made it to the motel. When he got to the motel he noticed that there were a lot of cars parked in the lot. Some of the cars still had keys in the ignition. The man walked up to the front desk and dinged the bell. How can I help you, asked the worker at the desk. Behind the worker, the man saw that all the keys were there but didnt think much of it. I would like a room please responded the man. The man handed him a key and showed him his room. Thank you, said the man. He entered the room, put his bag down, and headed to the bathroom to shower. In the bathroom, he noticed dried blood on the side of the bath. Hmmm, he thought, took a shower, and went to bed. The next morning the man woke up to a loud siren. He got up frantic thinking something was wrong. He heard banging at his door which he quickly ran to open. It was the man at the front desk. Is everything alright? he asked the man from the front desk. Its time for you to get up and get ready he replied. Excuse me, the man said confused. Its time for you to get up and get ready the front desk man repeated, he handed the man some gray clothes and left. The man stood there still very confused. He realized the sirens had stopped blaring. The man went to shower and got ready. After he went to have breakfast. When he got there, he saw 2 men standing in front of the entrance. When he tried to walk through the one on the left stopped him and told him to go back to his room. But Im hungry, the man said. The man on the left again told him to go back to his room. When can I get breakfast? He asked. The man on the right answered him saying when the time comes you will know. The man went back to his room and sat there. What is going on he thought. After about 30 minutes another siren when off. He heard knocking at his door. He answered it and saw the man who was standing on the right side of the breakfast door. You can come down now, he said and left. The man followed him to the breakfast area. He was showed to a table and told to sit down, which he did. 5 minutes later he saw a server coming out with food. She stopped at his table and sat his food down. The man looked around and it was only him. He ate his food and went to leave the motel. On his way out he was stopped by the man at the front desk who told him he could not leave until it was time. The man sat down on the bench next to the door and waited. An hour later a siren when off. He saw people walking in the streets and he followed them. He saw gray all over the place. After the weird morning, he just had he really wanted to leave the town as soon as possible. He asked the man in front of him for some directions to Rosewater which was the town he was traveling to. The person he asked looked him in the eyes and said, Once you come here you cant leave. The color left the mans face. What? he said. Once you come here you cant leave, he said again. W-what is this nonsense, the man said shocked. Hes trying to leave the man he asked screeched. All of a sudden everything stopped, and all eyes were on them. Hes trying to leave the man screeched again. Gasps were heard all around. Whispers Hes trying to leave, Why is he trying to leave, Who is he, but he cant leave, we must stop him. They started to surround the man yelling you cant leave once you come you have to stay. The man pushed himself through the crowd and ran. The crowd started to follow him. Wherever he ran to in the town the crowd would follow him, and the size would increase. The man was so scared and didnt know what to do. He ran into some alley and was able to hide for some time before the crowd would find him. He took deep breaths and started to think. By now there was somebody guarding the entrance of the town to make sure he wouldnt leave. Could he go back to the motel? No that wouldnt be a good idea most likely people would be there. He knew what he would do: he would wait until night then make his escape. He already looked like one of them thanks to the clothes he had gotten at the motel and thankfully he remembered his way back to the entrance. When nightfall came the man was ready. The man left the alley and looked like a townsman walking in the street. He passed the motel and continued to have his head down while walking. Since he was in gray and looked like everyone else the people in the town didnt pay much attention to him. Sirens started blaring again and the man noticed that it seemed like everyone was going in the opposite direction he was going in. He started to pick up his pace. He was so close to the entrance of the town. He continued not stopping or slowing down when he heard someone yell hey youre going the wrong way. And with that, he took off running. He heard yelling behind, he assumed it the person calling more people to help stop him. But he wouldnt be stopped. He was leaving this town today and now. He saw people coming at him from the sides and he started dodging left and right. Only to be attacked right at the entrance. They dragged him to the basement of the motel. The man fought with all his might but it simply wasnt enough."
Passing Through,"With stringy hair, a muddy face, and a panting breath, a young woman stumbles into Greely Greens. Her shirt, once white, is a matching dirt brown. Her ripped jeans reveal scrapes and blood at nearly every hole.Lee the bartender wipes the counter as he notices the stranger plop down on the stool in front of him. He tries to meet her gaze, but she buries her face in her arms. He then observes her head bob up and down and hears a faint sniffle. Shes cryingThe girl lifts her head and wipes her face. Uhh yeah she says in a raspy voice, barely above a whisper. Can I please have a cup of water.Lee obliges and leans against the counter, meeting her at eye level. Areare you okay?She gulps the whole glass. Yeah, Ill take some more water though, if you dont mind.He refills her glass. Miss, I dont want to pry, but if theres anything more I can do.anybody I can call?She sips the water this time and places it down. Maybe you can answer this question for me. Where am I?Why, youre in Greely Greens! he says with a smile. Friendliest bar in Patsville, Massachusetts.Massachusetts she says to herselfMiss, seriously if theres anything I can do. Anything at all. Just tell me everything that happened.No. No. she says, looking around the bar. Im done explaining things, if thats ok with you. If you dont mind telling me where I can find a hotel or something, thatd be great.Lee takes a step back, pauses. Uhh, yeahIf you just head straight down Dawson and make a right at Phillips, you should find Sallys Inn right there.Great. Thanks. The young woman finishes the rest of her water, grabs a crumpled wad of cash out of her pocket, and sifts through the bills. She finds a one-dollar bill, flattens it out on the table, and nods her head. Names Missy she says, then turns and walks out the door.***I said Jack and Coke...Lee? Hello?Lee startles and shakes his head, thawing out of his frozen state. Yea-sorry about that, Timmy. One Jack and Coke coming up.A minute later, Lee returns with the requested drink. As Tim raises it to his mouth, his grip on the glass feels sticky. The alcoholic soda is dripping on the sides. Somethingon your mind there, Lee?Lee notices only a few other people in the bar, all occupying the round wooden tables by the windows. He walks around and takes a seat next to his old friend. Isnt it the customer thats supposed to unload his problems to the bartender? he jokes.Just spit it out man.Lee tells of the young woman who came into Greely Greens not ten minutes before Tim. I dont knowI just feel like I, or like have to do something you know? Who knows what kinds of horrors that kind of woman has gone through? Cant imagine shes got any money.Well, you said shes staying at SallysHell, Ill go with ya.***Tim and Lee ring the door-bell. A classic Victorian House with colorful detail, Sallys Inn rests on a vast lawn decorated with geometrically trimmed hedges, a beautiful garden, and a tasteful apple tree. The door opens.Sally Tim says. Hate to disturb you at this hour.Although nearly 80 years old, Sally flashes a warm smile that emphasizes her youthful spirit. You couldnt possibly. How are you guys doing? Would you like to join us for dinner?I think were ok says Lee. Now this might sound strange, but did a young woman named Missy stop by here?Oh, yes! What a sweetheart, that girl.You mind if you tell her that were here? That is, if shes awake.The old innkeeper looks back into the house. Sure, one second. Ill let her know youre here. You sure you dont want to come in? I made lasagnaLee chuckles. Really, its fine. Dont worry, we know how good of a cook you are.Oh, youre so sweet she says. And hows Linda doing? She is such a wonderful soul.Lindaisgood. Ill tell her you said hi.Sally presses her hands together, almost as if in prayer. Oh, please do. That was such a nice wedding. So pretty. St. Pauls Church in the Spring! Nothing like it. And the whole town that raised you was there to celebrate. Oh-so precious!Thank you, Sally. Yeah, it wasspecial. Lee scratches his chin, urging to end the conversation and make clear his purpose for being there.Ill go get Missy then, right? she says, beaming at both Tim and Lee.Thatd be great, yeah Lee says, starting to feel tired.After a few minutes, the door opens. Out walks a beautiful, blonde woman in a pink nightgown. Her radiating beauty on a cold Michigan night is more intoxicating than the drinks Lee and Tim had shared at Greelys. Lee studies her face and can only recognize the smallest resemblance to the disheveled vagrant in the bar. She grabs Lee by the hand. You have past my test. Now you may have me.Jaw agape, the befuddled bartender turns to Tim, who shrugs his shoulders. Lee allows Missy to lead him into the house, leaving his friend behind. Her soft, lustrous skin and sexual energy stir up his loins as they walk up the stairs.They make it to her room, the beautiful mansions top tower, which serves as a citadel to the small town of Patsville. He looks out the arched-shape window. I can see my house from here he says. Pauses. Thats where myThats where your what? Missy says, gently touching his face.He turns to her and grabs her waist. Nothing.Kiss me she says.He does so, while caressing her body. They make their way onto the bed and continue. Lee cherishes her soft lips against his, until he feels a jolt in his spine. A syringe needle protrudes from his back as he falls face first onto the bed. He lifts his head up to look at the woman. Although appearing angelic a moment before, her blonde hair starts to darken, her eyes turn red, and her skin shades into a ghostly white, manifesting signs of an evil spirit. Although shedding effulgent innocence, in this form, she somehow looks even sexier.Before he fades out, he hears her words: You have failed my test. Now you may have nothing.***Hello Sally Smithers chimes as she waits outside Missys door. Are you finished in there? I made oatmeal raisin cookies!Come in says a faint voice.A red-eyed, pale-white woman humming a lullaby and dancing around a dead body: such is the scene as Sally steps into her often-vacant tower-room.Sally places the cookies on the nightstand and walks over to the closet, opens it. Put him with the others.As if Lees body were a bag of feathers, Missy grabs him by the shirt and tosses him in the closet, all the while humming her lullabies.Good says Sally. Have a cookie dear, theyre fresh.Missy obliges as they both munch on oatmeal-raisin goodness.My dear Sally continues. We will rid this town of all the sinners until we can restore some values here. One at a time.Missy looks out the window, surveying Patsville. One at a time."
the windows of the soul,"I am an ageless timeless being of infinite life. Before bedtime, and before I close my eyes to sleep I look out my window, and often imagine that the stars in the sky are kissing me on the cheek and that they turn into angels, and hold me close in their arms. I see the darkness as a light of life. I may not naturally see in the dark but spiritually I can see through it. I am ageless because age is a state of mind. I am timeless because there is no time in the spirit world. my body may die, but my spirit lives forever. My eyes are the windows of my soul, and what I see enters into it. There is no time like the present. I believe in the now not later. I believe in success, not failure. even when I do fail I get up and try again. I am a spirit, I live in a body, and I have a soul. I try to be the best I can be but, perfection never resides within my being. I notice many of my bodily members getting weaker, but my spirit says strong, and it supports my soul. I don't know a lot about the beginning, and end of life, but I do know we are born in this life, and in time we die at the appointed time our heavenly father has chosen for us. You might say that our eternal life is on the way. We have to live this life on earth for the betterment of man in order to live in harmony in heaven with God. As a child I was strong, but now I am old and so weak. I can not relive my childhood, but I can remember the good times. I can see them outside the window looking at the playground we played on. the friends we made, the first real kiss on the cheek from a girl. Outside every window, there is always someone looking in while you are looking out. We can not see them, but they can see us. God sees us. He sees us when we sleep, and he sees us when we awaken. He sees our yawns and knows how many times we breathe. I wish other people had a window like mine. they can see their dreams become reality, their visions will appear before them. I am somewhat sad because there are days I do not want to leave this world. Not until I have done all I am called to do and even then I would miss everyone that was left behind. My window opens and closes. It opens so I may feel the breeze hitting my face, and drying the tears from my eyes. My window closes when evil tries to enter it like a thief. I have to hold my window up because there is no brace to hold it. It takes all I have to keep it open, and all the strength in my body to close it. Looking out my window I see the sunrise and sunset. I see the daylight and the night. As the sun shines I can see its reflection create little sparkles upon the water after a rain. At night the moon and stars are my light in the widths of the darkness. It seems like the darkness is but a short time, and then the daylight is reborn once again. My bed is next to the window. I can see yet sleep, observe and yet dream. I can see everything and everyone going to and from my window. I welcome the good but close it when the evil forces try to attack me. I love my window. I can see for miles and miles away even with my eyes closed. One day I will be in heaven and look out from its windows, and see the glory of God around me. My window will stay open forever, and ever then the earth will take that which is hers for spirit, and soul will never ever end in death."" good morning window. I am so glad to see you"" Life is so precious, and death is far away but yet close at hand. I must keep watching out of my window for God's invisible hands to reach into it, and pull me from my mortal body, and place me in an immortal body. do you want a window of your own.? God will help you. all you have to do is reach out to him, and let him take your hands into his. He may seem so far away but he is closer than you will ever know. He may not speak audibly, but in the spirit, he has but one voice that you can hear if you just listen. Listen.! don't you see it, hear it.? it is the air you breathe every time your window is open. open the window, and let God in. He wishes to dry every tear from your eyes. his invisible hands are outstretched to. Rejoice, for it is God's pleasure to give you paradise. watch, pray, and wait for the darkness to become light. God is so close, and never far away. My window is white. white is the color of purity. I painted my window by myself. I even gave it a name. I call my window: Nature's eye. I can look into it, out of it, and when closed I  still see everything. ""Oh, the windows of heaven will be much greater."" I have had this window all my life, but I could never see out of it until I realized that my eyes could bear to see such a sight. My window is my world. I see everything in and around in. At times I see my reflection, and other times I see others looking in wanting a window of their own. My tears fog up the window so it is hard to see out of, but God often takes part of his mantle and clears the window so I can see through it. my widow. There will never ever be one like it because it is my world and I won't desire any other. My window is a virgin. it has never been broken by evil. God's strength holds the pane in place, and the glass is unbreakable. At one time my window was no more than the weight of a feather easily broken and ruined, but God fixed it to be stronger than ever and built to last a lifetime. Never again will my window be broken or neglected. I keep my window clean when the dirt from the outside covers it, and when the dust accumulates on the inside. the eyes are the windows of the soul. look into them. you can see my window.!"
"The Day, Night Dreamer.","The feeling you get when your alone and thinking to yourself while your by yourself. Starring out his window, like he always done so many times, Doug Travel was in deep thought. Doug was thinking of scenarios that he put himself in, those day dream imaginations, though they most likely would never happen.  It was one in the morning and Doug could not sleep. Doug always thought of himself as someone special and somehow important. Therefore, he would imagine he was doing those special and important things, and being that special and important person.  Sometimes Doug was a preacher, preaching to so many people. Other times he was a ninja, saving a village from bad ninja's, but just the same, they all were him being and doing special and important things.  This time Doug Travel was thinking of a girl. He had seen her in the convenient store earlier that day, when he was getting gas for his car. She had the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen, her complexion and smile, he was beside himself thinking of these qualities of her. She also had coal black hair, though she had white complexion.  Doug dreamed of being with someone like her. The very sweet thought of him and her together was so satisfying that he never wanted the thought to end. It was not easy finding that one and actually able to win someone over to be in a relationship with you.  Doug thought of so many scenarios with him eventually talking with her and sweeping her off her feet so they could be together. A few obstacles of course stood in his way, as most of his imagination day dreams went, ninja here, monster there, but just the same he always got what he wanted in his mind.  The wind came through the window and hit Doug in the face, which woke him up from his day, night dream. It was refreshing and the smell that came with it, honey suckle, was so nature sweet. He could now hear the tree branches close to his window sway back and forth. Doug also noticed his front yard, looking out his window, with the light from his garage shining half way through his front yard.  That feeling he had about the young female was still with him, but with a added feeling of content, sadness, and lonelyness now looking out his window into the empty world outside his window. Then thoughts of a fantasy world full of elf's and fairy creatures swam through his thoughts almost immediately. For some reason his mind jumped to these thoughts every time he looked out his window at night.    It was like that world was calling him, and he actually believed that the possibility of that world was real. He believed he was connected to the unseen world, the fairy world somehow. Have to remember though, Doug thought of himself as someone special and important. What was that, as Doug got chill bumps and noticing something moving down on his front yard. Just a rabbit he thought to himself, which was running up to his tree, by his window. "" Ok, I am letting my imagination run away from me again."" Doug said aloud.  So Doug decided to go into the kitchen for a late night snack, to brush off his thoughts of the unseen, fairy world. Every time Doug thought of these things it was like he summoned that world to him, and as if that world came alive. It scared him the most because he also believed it brought malicious beings he did not want near him. Deciding to fix himself a turkey sandwich Doug was now thinking ghosts or demons could be lurking about his home. Doug started to look behind him while fixing his sandwich, in the silient kitchen.   A one person hysteria was now coming over him. Why does it always end up this way Doug thought to himself. He just wanted a nice imagination session with the girl of his dreams. Calming himself down finally, Doug made it back into his room and turned on his game console and TV. Doug thought it best to play some games to relax him before he tried to go to sleep.   While Doug was playing his game and eating his sandwich, the rabbit outside, which Doug now unaware of,  was chasing something invisible off Doug's property. Then at that moment two other rabbits popped out from the nearby bushes. These rabbits as you might have guessed by now, are not ordinary rabbits. These rabbits were in fact from the fairy world, and have been protecting Doug his whole life, and the reason Doug felt so connected to that world.  In fact Doug Travel was a very special and important person, to the unseen, fairy world that is. You see every few decades a fairy creature reproduces with a human female, so Doug is a half fairy creature. They do this to keep tides with the human world, unoticed by the humans, because since Doug his half fairy creature himself, he will also in return protect them if the time ever arrises. Therefore, the fairy creatures get to see what the humans are up too because Doug will think nothing of their presence, since he will believe it is a normal thing.  In fact, his father, which is a fairy creature, right now is chasing off the bad fairy creatures in Doug's front yard, as a rabbit. Soon, when the time is right, Doug's father will tell him of his heritage and bring him to the unseen fairy world. They need to make sure the humans never found out about them ever again. The war so long ago, during the bronze era, almost wiped out both fairy and human creature alike. The last time fairy creatures let humans reveal them was with Merlin the magician, and that turned out to be almost another fairy human war.  Swallowing his last bite from his turkey sandwich, Doug turned his game off and crawled into his bed. He was now feeling somewhat happy and reassured himself everything will be ok tomorrow. The fairy rabbits outside hopped around his front yard to guard Doug. "" Soon my son. We will bring you to me and we can make this world the way it once was."" Said Doug's fairy father."" You have the gift of foresight, but soon you will understand."" Doug's father looked out across the front yard, layed his body close to the cold ground and then closed his eyes, as he knew Doug was also finally going to sleep, then whispered,"" My day, night dreamer. My heir to my throne."""
Chuma,"I was a Peace Corps volunteer. I arrived as a stranger to a town called Chuma. There I had the most wonderful dream. I had just taken a 19 hour bus ride for less than 101 miles. Note miles not kilometers, Meaning? I was on an alternative reality world. Where pounds, miles, and the sun was yellow not white. I had met some people who invited me to a party. That the party is or was for several days and nights. I did not comprehend. Why? I did not party like that. Nor in my reality did we dance for days on end. So getting off the bus. I was met by one of my only friends in that reality and the rest of realities. Angel. He has passed on. But I believe his soul was kind and his attitude towards life was wonderful. To me a complete stranger? He invited me and shared his home with me for the next. Well, that is a matter of opinion. For me I believe I was there for 14 days and nights dancing. While I am assured here that the party only lasts 2 days and three nights. However, according to my trip log. I was gone for a total of 18 days. So.. I am no longer sure. Which it was. I know I ate in more homes and was the life of a party.Why? I was a gringo and for some odd reason they had a legend or story about some white guy showing up. And? Well, lets say I danced as a bear for four days. A slave owner for five days. And with a group of I really don't recall what their costumes were for 6 days. And we ate, drank, and danced from around 5 AM until 3 AM the next day continuously.It was a strange town in the middle of nowhere Bolivia. And I was the stranger. And? The ladies loved me. Why? I would pick one and waltz her to a music that I can only describe to you as a dream. And? Then I would swing her to a different tone. And then? I would dazzy chain her, her daughter, and sisters together in a square dance. Sounds fun. And it was. And the older ladies loved it. And I?I loved dancing.The drinking? Well, chicha is fun to drink They had both kinds. However the real kicker was the trigo. A sort of three times heated alcohol which makes you dream such lovely dreams. And did I dream? Well, I am a strnger to this realm after all. I dreamt that I lived on Sagittarius for forty plus years. Who is to say this is the dream or that?After all the final few minutes of death one experiences such a wild ass dream that I beliv I am watching the end of time. Tht bill gates and microsoft with their patent 2000060606 is the mark of beast. And that an end of things is upon mankind. So who knows. That I am dead here I am pretty sure I died here a long time ago. And that I am passing back through. I mean this is a nebula galaxy a passing through galaxy of the souls to the realm of the dead. Oh, I am a stranger alright and you are in my host story now.So where was I?Ah Peace Corps? So, there I was dancing drinking. And eating. When I got introduced to some professional soccer player. Evidently famous in his time. And he told me the weirdest story of why Peace Corps in 1960s was kicked out of Bolivia with the help of Sweden and China communist.You see Peace Corps was accused of promoting abortions and sterilzing women in 1960s with a movie called El Condor. A film financed by China made by a Swede about Peace Corps volunteers sterilizing women in Bolivia without their permission or knowledge.Anyway, according to this soccer player who was some sort of political person then. Peace Corps in 1960s was setup to help in the war against Vietnam Communist. Why? Because with all the US supercomputers and linguist they could not break a code that the Northern Vietnamese were using over the radios. And? Finally the convinced the President JFK to create a volunteer force of people tto help US find people to speak different languages. Because evidently at that time few people were interested in leaving the US. So Peace Corps was born to find the secret language used by the Vietnamese were using over open radio and which supercomputers could not break.So sometime in 1962 a Peace Corps volunteer got lost in a remote part of Bolivia and happened upon a village that had the language used in Vietnam. Meaning? The Chinese had picked up on the secret of the code talkers in World War II and found a language in Aymara dialect that was unbreakable and is to this day.Why was it so unbreakable?   Simple each place and location had a different tone, and reflection which meant something totally different to the people talking in the conversation. Meaning? Well, from my understanding say you were in your garden talking about your garden. Well the whole conversation on your property was your conversation and tone and reflection meant the same. While, if you were on the other person's garden the tone and reflection meant his garden. And?So Viet Cong used photos and the code was the photos. So if one was told to pick up say photo 1.  The whole conversation went with photo 1. And if you did not have photo 1 you had no idea what the two people were talking about.  Now. Remember this was told over a drinking game.  What game was that?Seemed they thought they could out drink me. And?  I don't drink. I am a nondrinker. However, I held my own and put 43 people to sleep by doing one shot per shot until they said enough.  And? Well, My story continues. You see I am a time traveler. Going back to the dyson sphere or heaven or hell. I have not figured out which yet. And you? If I truly lived on Sagittarious you have been dead some billions of years now and are just playing a part in afated story in which either I am evil or a sinner and that is something I am looking forward to finding out which."
The Home and the Homemaker,"A long, abandoned farm house in the middle of nowhere waited, through years, changing seasons, and the inevitable encroachment of nature. It waited for breath and heart beats. Memories of laughter and life echoed through its lonely halls. It stood alone, in stoic silence for so long that it eventually lost itself in a sort of deep sleep. Until the day she returned. It knew her instantly, though she was a woman now. How many years had it been? It couldnt be sure but she was just a girl when it last saw her. 	She had to thrust all of her body weight at the dark, mahogany door to open it. She wandered through the house, tracing the walls and furniture with her fingertips, as though she were reading it by brail. She moved slowly, reacquainting herself with every corner and every detail, until she reached the shabby door of what used to be her grandmothers guest room. 	The door opened with a crack, as she broke the seal formed by time. It was exactly as she remembered, from the glow-in-the-dark stars stuck to the ceiling, to the white-washed pine floors. She sat on the antique metal bed and bounced a little, chuckling as she remembered the screech of the springs. 	It didnt take long for the tears to come. Isnt it funny how the best memories make the biggest tears? Everything had been left untouched, since her grandmothers passing. She ran her hands over the quilt on the bed. Her grandmother had made that quilt. Once, she had been down with the flu. Her grandmother had covered her with it, and sat by her bedside the entire night. 	I remember you, grandma. She said out loud, wiping the tears from her eyes. I remember the apple pies you made. The way your hands looked covered in flour. The way you smelled of butter and cinnamon. I remember pulling raspberries, warm from the sun off of the bush and the way they tasted, sweet and tart and beautiful. 	I remember laying on the floor and watching T.V. with you in the evening, while the breeze brushed past the curtains. You had the same phone number my whole life and no matter where I was, how long it had been between calls, no matter how late, you always answered, and you always listened. I miss that. I miss you.  Walls have ears and wood has a memory. The house sighed deeply. Every person has a purpose, depending on the person. Every house has a purpose and it's to be a home. Life was, once again, under this roof.  A truck pulled into the driveway. The sound of the door slamming pulled Colleen Donovan into the present. She ran down the creaky, old stairs and opened the door for the contractor. They walked every inch of the house talking about plans for renovation. 	Youll take the master suite of course? He said, pulling a pencil from behind his ear, jotting, showing a note. 	Uh... no. actually Im taking the guest room.  He cast a confused look in her direction. But this room is considerably smaller and 	I understand. She replied, smiling, not expecting him to understand.  A crew of workers came. They sanded and stripped and painted and restored, but she wouldnt let them touch the guest room. The house became a home again. She slept every night under the same glow-in-the-dark stars and hand stitched quilt from her childhood.  That little, white farm house was her soulmate and she thrived and bloomed there. She spent golden afternoons and purple twilights gardening, reading, and sipping tea. 	A fall night came bringing a thick fog that covered the fields and orchards. She lit a fire and laid in the glow reading John Steinbeck in awe. The world was quiet and still, except for the homey pops and snaps of burning wood. Then, a gentle knock at the door brought her to her feet. She peered out a window and saw a man. He stood as tall and stately as an elm and he was singing softly to himself.  Now, Colleen was not a stupid woman and normally she would not open the door to a strange man in the middle of the night. But, she was inexplicably compelled. She opened the door a crack and looked up at him, straining to make out his features, in the dim porch light. 	Can I help you? 	No. But I can help you. His voice was low and yielding, a peculiar mixture of accents and tones. His presence reminded her of the feeling you get when youre trying to remember someones name and its right on the tip of your tongue, but you just cant quite recall. 	May I come in?  She stepped back and opened the door wide, before she even realized what she was doing. He bowed his head to enter through the doorway. As he stepped into the light, she could see that he was blond, with clear, slate-gray eyes. He was all at once both stunning and unremarkable. 	Can I get you some tea? She asked, walking towards the kitchen.  Yes, please. As she made busy, lighting the stove and filling the kettle, she marveled at herself. She was completely at ease, comfortable even. She placed mugs on the counter and sat across the table from him.  Who are you? 	I am a messenger. His eyes were fixed to hers and she suspected that he could read her thoughts. 	 And you have a message for me? 	I do. He nodded. About that time, the little yellow kettle hissed and sputtered. She prepared the tea in easy silence... the kind of comfortable, quiet familiarity that normally develops through years of companionship. She sat the cup before him. 	Okay she said, returning to her chair. She watched the chamomile steam rising from her cup for a moment, then looked up at her messenger. 	Your children are waiting for you, he said, in a feather-light tone, barely above a whisper. Somehow he loved her, she knew it. She furrowed her brows, confused. 	I have no children. The doctor said I wasnt able 	That is true, and still your children wait for you. He drew a deep, long drink from his cup and then continued. You are a homemaker. Its your calling. You will share your gift with all different types of children. Some will stay with you a while,others will stay just a short time. But, all of them will remember you and this place. He scanned the cozy little kitchen with the herbs growing in the window and the faded brick fireplace, and he smiled. Maybe, the only genuine smile shed ever seen. It will be hard. Anything worthwhile is. You know that. But the good will far outweigh the bad. He finished his tea, stood and made his way to the door. 	Wait! She was fighting away tears. Tears composed purely of joy, overflowing. I still dont understand! Her eyes begged for answers. 	He turned to her, with the knowing devotion of a father. Your understanding will become clearer in the morning. Whats meant to be will come to pass. Its not up to you to design. He left, walking into the apple orchard beyond the house. She began to forget him the moment she closed the door. By morning he was completely gone from her memory, but his message remained.  That day, she signed up to be a foster parent. She signed the papers, took the classes, and within two weeks time, she opened the door to her first child. A painfully thin, wide-eyed, ghost, with bruises head to toe. She was filthy, tangled and traumatized. Colleen had no idea how she could possibly help this child. Five years old, nearly to the day, but she would not speak and her eyes were empty. So, Colleen gave her a bath, combed her hair, and gave her the guest room. She too slept beneath the glow-in-the-dark stars and a hand-stitched quilt, just as Colleen.	In the morning, the little girl awoke to the homey smell of pancakes. In that house she learned about hugs and comfort and the stunningly simple pleasure that is banana bread. She was resurrected by the sounds of Carol King on the kitchen radio, rain slapping the windows, and the never-ending hum of an old, metal fan. The simplicities of home brought that girl to life.  There were many more over the years. They came broken and often left mended. Some of them were harder to love than others. Colleen felt her humanity then. She grew the most and loved the hardest, and sometimes wondered if any of it mattered at all.  When she was old, too old to take on any more children, they returned to her. One by one, they were all drawn back to that little farm house and the room with the glow-in-the-dark stars and that old hand-stitched quilt.  Those children, her children, who she had loved and set free, went out into the world and became important people. They were doctors, architects, blue-collared workers who came home and poured love over their families. The closest to her heart were the home makers.  That old farm house always knew its calling and it never considered that it may not be able to fulfill that calling. It never discounted itself as unimportant or unworthy. It knew that the seeds of life are planted at home and the effects of that place, home, are incalculable. It waited, dormant for its other half. The home maker. And together, they touched the world, as only they could."
The Room,"The room was dark. Cold. It was impersonal; untouched by friendly voices, light, or mirth. It had been this way for years. Nothing adorned the walls save some white paint. Nothing decorated the dark wood floor to lessen the chill. The bed was saggy in the center as if it had once seen years of use and the coverlet was frayed around the edges. Now, nothing but the dust gathering in the corners seemed to inhabit the space.A photograph in a black frame on a worn out nightstand lay face down, suggesting it had either tipped or been placed that way on purpose. The lamp with its shabby yellow-cloth shade, hung over the photo as if it disapproved of the frames decision to fail in its one simple task. The walls looked on placidly. Oh if only they could talk and share what had happened to this room. Why it been stripped of any personal touch.Noise could be heard outside. It was part of a house with happy inhabitants. They ran up and down the halls but never once opened that brown wood door. Never once did they enter inside it to look round them or to clean its cracks.The single window at the opposite side of the door, hung above the saggy bed, overlooking a garden; and further the ocean could be seen. A raging storm, just days ago, had created a crack in the drywall around the sill. But if anyone knew about it they did not care. For no carpenter appeared to aid in the restoration. No, now when a strong storm blew through, the window creaked and the crack grew in size.Once the room had been a shade of white that did not appear so dismal. The walls had paintings and framed photographs of various plants on them. The bed had been younger and more springy. A knit kaleidoscopic rug had covered a great portion of the mahogany floor. The photograph had stood proudly on the simple nightstand and the lampshade was free of dust.This had been when the room was in constant service. When the owners of the house had parties and allowed travelers to stay in the room. Then, there had been no crack in the sill and the room felt loved and touched with adventure. But times had changed.No longer was hosting travelers considered safe or even wanted. The couple who had loved the room had long gone. The house had passed into anther's possession. That person cleared everything out of the room except the photo which they had lay face down in its present condition. As the dust began to build, the house found a new owner and another after that. And none had ever done anything with the room except to poke their heads in, with the stuffy man in the suit, when they were purchasing the place.In fairness the room was tucked away. It was on the top floor at the end of a hall, cramped in where one side was actually under the eaves. As a result that side of the room had a low wall which slopped upward as it outlined the roofs shape. It was an easy space to miss, forgettable. In fact it had been forgotten. An occasional child could be heard outside its creaky door inquiring about what lay within, but they were always called off the hunt and would go away again without ever entering through the portal.Wind rustled in the trees outside the window. The breeze filtered in through the crack bringing a small and momentary freshness to the room. The house creaked and the room shifted imperceptibly with it.Once, a vagrant had slept in this room. The owners couldnt stand the idea that he was outside with a massive storm on its way. The bed contracted bed bugs and the rug had to be fumigated but the owners had felt a massive sense of relief in their consciences, and the vagrant had felt compassion for the first time in years.He returned to the room several years later as a respectable gentleman and stayed the night for old times sake. As he stood in the little guest room overlooking the garden and the ocean, the owners had stood in the doorway crying tears of joy at hearing his tale. Hed been so moved by their generosity that hed managed to turn his whole life around. The walls of that room had never glowed so brightly since.The Owners were dead now. Long gone. Their stories and their guests locked within the walls of that room. The springs of that ancient bed telling the tale of a once loved once bright and chipper household.The door to the room creaked open. The room waited, the air from the crack in the window sucked out by the variation in air pressure. A woman poked her head inside. She was new. The man in the suit was with her.See just a room under the eaves. his voice was saying. The door closed as the woman with yellow curls nodded her head.Cute.The room settled back into the darkening gloom unchanged. Another owner. Days passed and the usual noise of those moving out and those moving in took over. The ratty sheer curtain that hung over the broken window shifted in the breeze of the oceanic air.Once a sailor had rented this room from the owners. His ship had sunk off the harbor mouth and he had to wait for his company to send him a new ship to ride on. He was foreign and barely spoke any of the language, but his voice was clear and clean like that oceanic breeze. He sang several sea shanties and love songs from the window of that room. The room had felt alive then and foreign.Once, before the Owners had died and the shifting ownership had moved in, a young girl with bright curls had stayed in the room for weeks. It was supposed that she would be the permanent occupant. She brought in a photograph of herself with the Owners and placed it on the nightstand. But she became deathly ill. She threw up all over the kaleidoscope rug and shortly afterwards she was removed from the room altogether. As was the kaleidoscope rug. But it returned in good health three days later.Days rose and fell. The moon shone on the room in eerie cold lights. Once, on a night when that same eerie glow had been shining, a man and a woman flew into the room in a passion. They were there the remainder of the night but they did not sleep. The next day when they left, the room looked as though a hurricane had passed through it. The pictures were skewed on the wall and the coverlet had been tossed in a heap. The photograph was under the bed. The room had never known such excitement.But now it was raining and the rain was filtering in through the crack. A small damp puddle was beginning to form on the hardwood floor. The wind sighed through the room as if it were as melancholy as the sad little space.Voices could be heard outside the door. Traveling closer. Closer. Closer. The door creaked open.Well need to get oil for that door. A man in coveralls says. His mustache is twitching as he sneezes in the room. Dust flies up and then settles. He carries with him crack filler and the necessary accoutrements to fix the problem.The blond woman follows him. She nods, her curls bouncing. She walks to the nightstand and looks down at the photograph frame that is overturned. She picks it up to look at the photo.I once lived here. she murmurs. Her fingers glide over the faces in the picture.The man in coveralls grunts as he begins to work. Is that right?Yes. This was my Aunt and Uncles house. She places the photo upright and absently begins to dust with her fingers. Shooing the dirt to the floor off the simple round wood base of the lamp.What happened? The man dries the crack and the floor with a dirty work towel.I became very ill and had to be sent to hospital. I stayed there for most of my life and they unfortunately passed away before I was free of the place.The man tips his dirty cap back on his head revealing more of his forehead. This is a bad crack.The girl turns to look. Her adolescent face is reflected in the photograph on the stand. This was my room once. It looks like no-one has used it since my Aunt and Uncle passed. Do the best you can. I intend to bring this room back to life. She left the room quietly and the man got to work.Once done he stood and admired his handiwork before taking a turn round the room. A bit of paint and a new bed this room might be alright. he left.The room felt warmer somehow. The glow of the afternoon sun filtered in through the ratty curtain and fell upon the photograph."
A letter to my first love,"Sleep is a notorious human activity. You see, it is the time when the human soul swings between life and death. Many like you and I survive but some proceed into deep sleep, which extends beyond the physical realm you said to the five-year-old me who was cuddled beside you. The words soul, life and death seemed to be carved out of a mystical book until a year later, when you passed away in your sleep.For the world we were a family of three, but only you and I knew that only we two were the family. The man who used to share our accommodation. He was my father in the eyes of the world but a stranger in my heart. Eyes of the world it is a funny metaphor. Everyone knows about its eyes but no one knows about where its heart lies so that it could see how lonely I was without you even when it had just been a few hours since you stepped out of this world which gave you nothing except dejection.My tiny eyes were swollen up from crying all day. Give him something to eat. He will feel fine said a woman with a big belly, Sleep would help him said an old man from the other side. Sleep, indeed would have helped me but I wanted the one like yours so that next day I could wake up beside you as always. Alas, I couldnt. I woke up back again in that tiny room of ours, in that old wooden bed, everything was there but not you.I expected your side of the bed to be empty, just like my soul was, but it was occupied, no not my soul, your side of the bed. It was occupied by him, that man, your husband. He hadnt woken up, but tears were trickling down from his eyes. First time I saw his face so close to me. His skin was not as soft as yours, it was withered, it was dry, and it had scars here and there. The distinguished smell of his when he used to come back home at night was no more, but it doesnt mean it was as sweet as yours my dear Maa.We will be having an activity that will be an ice breaker for the new boy in the class said my teacher when you got admitted to a new school. The thing that was between him and I was not ice Maa, it was stone and to even make a crack in the stone without hurting oneself needs some skills along with the force.His sudden proximity with me felt like a force without any skill, the pressure built from it was sucking the air out more and more from my lungs, from the home and from my life.The chapatis were half burnt, the milk remained cold and curries tasted bland but I ate them without any ifs and buts as you had said Lucky are those who get roof over head and luckier are those who get both roof over head and food in the belly the tickle at my protruding tummy would often made me to forget to ask about luckiest ones. Today I will complete it for you Luckiest are those who get roof over head, with food in their belly along with the ones who love them. With your demise I had slipped down from the luckiest clan to the luckier one.Like sleep, time is a notorious act of life. It makes you forget things. The essence of you started fading in my fragile mind but the body was still in inertia. I made sure it stayed right there. See, I have stitched it back, now dont tear it again you said, relishing the efforts that you put to obscure that tear. But it got torn again at the same place this time it was worse.When he saw it, he didnt say anything but next day he got me a new shirt. I threw it away and ran away from him, he was taken aback. He followed me, taking big steps at a time. So, I ran out, out of the house, alone, wearing knickers and bare-footed. The pebbles on the road were causing piercing pain but that pain was not strong enough to beat the pain that was burning me from inside. At last I collapsed onto the dusty road. The world seemed to be moving around too fast. Round and round, like we two used to do and then fell on the floor laughing. In the midst of unknown faces, a known yet unknown face sprouted out. It was him, the man who lived with us.When I woke up, I was lying on our same old wooden bed. Besides me he was crying. I know I am not as good as your mother was, but I am trying to become better than I was, he spoke as he cupped my face in his burly hands. It was the day when I saw the warmth that used to linger in your hazel eyes.That day marked the start of another chapter in my life, not with the man that shared our house, but instead with the man who was making efforts to be my father and the stone between us carved into abeautiful bond, from a stranger to a father and then a friend.Its been thirty years since you left and every day I wish you could be alive to see how both of us made our lives together and moved on from all the regrets and complaints.Today you are now no more just a mother, but grandmother of my son. Yes I have grown old, older than you.HmmIts late. I have to leave now. This time I had decided to not burning this letter like others. Its going to stay with me. Always. Like that smile on your lips.Lots of love.Your Son."
House Rules,"It was totally empty. The guest room that was in the three-story home of the Slices. The ad said nothing about it being empty. Leaf Cole was a traveling photographer from New York. He ended up in the town of Lone Oak. MA by way of an assignment given him by the editor of his paper. Mr. Sam Sawn called Leaf to his office. Hey, son I got an assignment for you in Lone Oak, MA. I need you to go and take photos of the town. This isnt a big town, but Im told it would be a perfect place for a movie. A movie Leaf thought. Sam could see the look on Leafs face, he could tell Leaf was surprised by this. Mr. Sawn told him this assignment was kind of off the record. This assignment was for a movie that Sawns friend wanted to shoot and was looking for a location. The friend needed photos of the town. The photos would help him decide to film there or not.What kind of movie is it? Leaf asked. Sawn, told Leaf it was a ghost story of such. Leaf, I will be paying for everything so dont worry. I need you to get online and find yourself a place to stay, just let me know"", Sawn instructed Leaf. He told Leaf to be prepared to be there for at least two weeks. Leaf had about a week to make his plans. He had it all done within three days. He decided to drive down, and even that was taken care of. He was provided a car but he chose to drive his own. A  gas card was provided with no limit. Leaf thought, this must be important.Leaf found the ad online about the Slices guest room that was available. The ad said nothing about it being empty, not one word.This was his assumption because the ad never mentioned any amenities. Leaf thought nothing of it because at the same time, though it said nothing about being empty, it said nothing about what was in it. This had to be a misprint he thought. Leaf took the room because of the price. Why he was concern with the price was beyond him. He did not have to pay for it, and he knew it. He had already made an agreement that he would take it and time was of the essence, so he took it. The agreement was for two weeks with the option to extend if need be. Leaf arrived at the Slice house around 2pm on that Sunday. The address was 4217 Oak Tree Rd. The house was easy to find, of course the GPS made it easy. As Leaf was driving through the town, which was very quaint. It was nothing to write home about and I guess this was what Mr. Sawns friend was looking for, Leaf thought. He pulled up to the three-story house. It was white with black shutters around the windows that were across the fronts and sides The front door was black as well. What was odd, not so much the house but that the surrounding houses were almost identical. They were various colors, colors he himself had never seen on houses. But Leaf thought he was from New York which had mostly brick homes. So, this too Leaf put aside and gave it little thought. Leaf imagined that someone would come out to greet him, especially with his loud 2001 Red Mustang car. It had loud exhaust pipes that could be heard down the street, but no one came to the door, no one looked out the windows, nothing. Leaf took his black duffel bag from the trunk. And when he lowered the trunk there stood Mr. Slice in front of his car. It literally scared Leaf to the point he let out a squeal and dropped his bag. He shook his head and thought, where in the heck did, he come from?! He was not there when he pulled up. Hello, my name is Bryan Slice, welcome to my home. Mr. Slices held out his hand to shake Leafs. Leaf shook his hand and graciously accepted Bryans invite to his home. Bryan led Leaf inside and showed him the room he would be staying in. Thanks for allowing me to stay in your home. I hope to be gone within two weeks and wont have to extend my visit. Leaf said. Bryan said nothing as he showed Leaf upstairs. Leaf thought that was strange, the man said not one word. The bedroom was upstairs and in the far corner of the second floor. The door the lead into the room was black. A piece of wood with the words guest sleeps here on it hung on the door. ""Whoever carved those words into the wood did a very good job"", Leaf thought he would vocalize this to Bryan in hopes to break the ice. Bryan again said nothing. He reached in his pocket retrieved the the key to the door. He proceeded to open it and the door swung open and Bryan allowed Leaf to go in first. Leaf did not know what to expect but knew he had better be prepared. However, much to his surprise there was a well decorated bed with two big pillows. The bed looked to be a queen size with four posts. It was made of wood, but he did not know what type of wood it was. The comforter was black, the curtains were black. Leaf did not notice the black curtains when he first pulled up. But none the less, Leaf was pleasantly surprised. He had a black recliner chair, a small desk with a lamp on it. There was a door that led to a small bathroom. It had a tub, shower sink mirror, just like back at home. He had a dresser and on it was what looked like a 32-inch flat screen TV. Bryan simply stood there saying nothing as Leaf took everything in and looked around. He finally spoke and again startled Leaf. Mr. Cole. Leaf interrupted him, You dont have to call me Mr. Cole. You can call me Leaf. I am not inclined to call you by your first name Mr. Cole. We dont have that type of relationship. Mr. Slices replied. So, if you dont mind, I will continue to call you Mr. Cole. Leaf could do nothing but to respect Mr. Slices request. Mr. Slices without saying it, Leaf knew he wanted him to call him Mr. Slices. Leaf had no problem with that. Mr. Slices asked if he needed anything before, he left. Leaf was shown the closet with bed linen and with towels, all black. When asked if there was anyone else living in the house he was told, yes. Mr. Bryan Slices had three kids and a wife. They lived on the first floor. Mr. Slices handed Leaf a list of house rules for Leaf to read. Bryan, though he did not have much to say, he did however, quite sternly and somewhat insistently all but demand he read the house rules.     Leaf found Mr. Slices a nice guy but rather snappish. He had a snap reply for just about any question or comment Leaf had. He went back outside to his car after being shown the guest room. He still needed to get his camera equipment. When he got to his car there stood John Slices the older child of the Slices. The two Slices' girls were away. Mrs. Slices still had not made an appearance, but Leaf was okay with that. John walked around Leafs car and without being asked he began to give him a round down about it. The motor, horsepower etc. Leaf was impressed and it was clear that John was a car enthusiast. You like cars I see, Leaf spoke, breaking Johns gazed from the car. Yes Sir, I do. I like how they can get up and go. I bet this can take off. Its a Shelby. I know they got speed. John could not deny it, they do, and he was proud of his car. His grandfather had bought it for him, and he had spent many hours and lots of money getting it just right. It had already had some wear and tear, but Leaf saw what could be. Leaf finished up his conversation with John and headed inside while John began to make his way down the street to meet his friends, Steve and Larry who were coming up the street.Nice meeting you Sir. You too John. Before he got too far up the street, he turned back toward Leaf and yells, Read those house rules!Leaf headed inside and almost made it up the stairs to the guest room when he heard, Hello young man. It was the softest voice he had ever heard. It was finally Mrs. Lucy Slices, Bryans wife. She was dressed like any other middle-aged housewife, white caprice pants, red sleeveless blouse that button down front, her sunglasses rested on her red shoulder length hair. She wore white Keds slip on tennis shoes to finish her summertime casual attire.Leaf had to admit she was a decent looking lady. She wore just enough makeup that you knew she had it on, but at the same time, it was not melting off her face. Leaf turned and spoke, Hello Maam, how are you? Im doing well. She had just come in from the back of which Leaf was yet to explore but  he figured he would in time. She had two bags in her hand, would you like help with those, Leaf asked. No, I have them. She set them on the kitchen counter. Leaf preceded to tell her he had met Bryan, her husband and John, her son. Bryan? I am certain he corrected you, Mr. Slices, right? Leaf was invited to eat dinner with them. It was the house rules that the first nights dinner of all guest was on the house, afterward they were on their own. Bryan did give you a copy of the house rules, right?, she asked. Yes, he did, Leaf replied. I hope youve taken time to read them.No, not yet, Leaf replied. Okay, Leaf thought what was it with these house rules? That was the third time he had been told to read the house rules. What on earth could be so important that he had to read them? He thought, make sure all lights are out, keep door closed, no loud music, keep room clean, what?He continued in his mind, you buy and cook your own food and clean up after yourself if you cook your own food. Leaf laughed at himself at that one. He found himself in his room. The day had been long, and he was tired. He laid back on one of the big black pillows on the bed. On the nightstand laid the piece of paper Bryan had given him earlier, the house rules. He picked it up and begin to read. In the morning he thought if asked he would be able to say, yes I read the house rule. There was only one rule, Never open the attic door."
Chasing the Sun,"The grandson was looking out of the window, down at the woods that ran through his wildest imaginations.	""Hey!"" a voice shouts from behind him.	He turns to see his grandpa standing in the doorway.	""What are you doing up this late at night?"" Grandpa questioned.	""I can't fall asleep, can you tell me a story?"" the grandson asked.	There once was a great shining knight Grandpa started before being interrupted by his grandson.	Ive already heard this story before, can you tell a different one this time, Grandpa? the grandson pleaded with beading eyes.	Alright, Grandpa said before putting down the book, I have a special story for you.	Wheres the book? the grandson questioned, sitting up from his bed to look at Grandpas hands.	There is no book for this one, this is from the heart.	But how will I read this story again? the boy continuing with his everlasting questions.	Whenever youre sitting in your bed, just like now, and you need something to entertain yourself, just think to yourself, and the story will come to you, Grandpa explained.	But the grandson began before Grandpa coaxed him to pull up his covers and get comfortable.	This story is about a kid, just like you, Grandpa pointed to the grandson, and how he and his friend went on an adventure in the wilderness, just them two, no adults, no supervision.	Grandpa continued, Are you ready?	The grandson replied with a simple nod. 	Sam was walking down the streets of Decatur, Tennessee, a small town of two hundred people right outside Knoxville. He walked into the small convenience store, picked out a Coke, put a nickel on the counter, and left. He continued his stroll through the town, passing by his school, which filled all the kids of the town, including his best friend, Dew. Sam has known Dew since before they could even remember anything. 10 years later, they were still as close as anyone could be.	Sam, now remembering about Dew, ran like a gazelle to his house. He leaped over fences, ran through bushes, and eventually arrived at Dews house. Dews family lived in a simple, 1-story house that you could tell theyve tried keeping up, but have let go over the last few years. They had a large field in their backyard that led to the woods where Sam and Dewey would spend their adventures. However, they had never gone past the creek that marked the boundary between Dews backyard and the unknown, respectively called The Damned Creek. Theyve always dared each other to go over the creek, but the farthest anyones made it was a simple hop, and then a hop back-	Wait, they were scared of the woods? the grandson interrupted.	Yes, and they had a very good reason to, Grandpa cheerfully replied.	The grandson sat in silence for a minute, pondering.	Well I wouldnt be scared of no woods, even if I was just a baby, the grandson finally stated.	Oh grandson, you still are just a baby. Now settle down and lets finish this story.	Summer had just started, so Sam had a plan in mind for the boys. Sam knocked on the wooden door and promptly opened it and entered the room. Dews family had treated Sam as one of their own, so they didnt mind. Sam ran through the dusty, ragged house, each stomp feeling it might pummel through the creaking floorboards. He saw Dew in the old rocking chair in the living room.	Hey Dew! Sam blurted out the second he entered the room.	Hey Sam! Dew ecstatically responded.	I have an idea, Sam left Dew wondering.	Whats the idea? Dew questioned.	Sam took the old walking stick by the front door and pointed towards the backyard with it, Were going to where no man has ever gone before! he exclaimed.	We- Were going to th- the woods? Dew stuttered.	We are going to fully explore the other side of The Damned Creek, and there is nothing and no one who is going to stop us, Sam proudly said with his fists on his hips.	But how will we ever get back? Dew nervously responded.	Sam sensed Dews apprehensiveness, and comforted him, Dont worry Dew, were just gonna go over to the other side, look around, and then come back.	Thats it? Dew, still nervous, but feeling slightly better.	Thats it, now lets pack our essentials and leave after the sun dips below the tip of that tree, Sam pointed to the large apple tree residing in the backyard.	Dew nodded and went into his bedroom to pack.	The boys walked with their backpacks full of food and tools such as knives, apples, and even hammers. They were unsure of the frontier, but Sam was ready to enter and Dew was still apprehensive, but was mostly ready. They encountered the fresh-water creek that divided the two lands from each other. The two boys looked at each other, giving each other the go-ahead signal to enter the unexplored territory, and suddenly, they jumped together. 	Birds flew out of the area, heading towards the heavens as the boys trekked along the frontier. They hacked and slashed through the shrubbery which crowded the forest floor with Sams homemade pocket-knife. Dew had his fathers binoculars out, hoping to see a rare species of birds fluttering about. The sun shone through the forest top, breaking through pockets of space, revealing the numerous leaves around.	Sam took out his compass and asked Dew, Do you remember what direction your house is in?	Dew looked around, but was confused as all the directions looked the same, Im not sure Dew said apprehensively.	Sam looked down at the compass, in which the needle was pointing west.	It says that we are going west, so I guess your house is in the East, Sam concluded.	No no, that cant be right because the forest is to the right of my house, Dew worriedly cried.	Well then how are we going towards your house if weve been traveling in the same direction for the past 30 minutes? Sam questioned.	I dont know, but I think we should go back--	Right on cue, as if God was watching from above, clouds surrounded the sky, and lightning struck, sending the boys into panic. They frantically ran in a direction, much less worried about being lost, and more worried about the imminent threat of weather. The boys jumped and ducked and weaved their way through branches, shrubs, and trees. Out of breath, they stopped to catch their breath, panting like a dog who had been running for hours.	Hey, what direction did we run in now? Dew asked Sam.	Sam put his hands in his pockets when he didnt feel anything. He then put his hand in his backpack to locate the compass. He didnt feel anything either. A sudden sense of fear and panic struck Sam like a train and he didnt feel too good.	Dew, I I think I need to-- 	Sam woke up in a rush.	Woah, woah, woah, you need to stay down there buddy, Dew coaxed Sam, You were out a little while, its almost sunfall, we need to get out of here now.	Sam looked around to see the orange reflection of the sun bounce off the leaves of the trees. He got himself up and studied the area once again. He noticed the way the shadows were casted.	Look, Sam pointed to the base of the trees, See how the shadow is pointing that way (he pointed towards the right of the tree).	Dew nodded.	That means the sun must be in the opposite direction of the shadows, Sam exclaimed, And since the sun always sets in the West, we must follow it to your house.	The boys excitedly picked up their stuff to head back home when they suddenly heard a growl from nearby. Dew and Sam simultaneously turned their heads in the direction of the noise and saw a large gray wolf. Its beady yellow eyes stared into the flesh of the boys, giving its signal that it wants to have dinner.	Um, Sam, we should... you know run Dew mentioned to Sam.	Sam motioned his finger to his mouth as a way of telling Dew to shut up. Sam picked up a rock from next to his foot.	The second this rock hits that tree, we run, Sam told Dew, who nodded in agreement.	Sam wound up his arm, and looked at Dew for a second, and launched the rock. It made a large cracking sound as it hit the bark. The wolf turned its attention to the noise as the boys took off. They ran and ran, harder than ever before. They felt like cheetahs as the trees and grounds whipped past them as they chased the sun. The sun was glowing through the sky, giving Earth its goodbye, as the boys hurried towards the house. They did not look back to see if the wolf was chasing them or not. They just ran. Sam looked ahead and saw a tiny dip in the land, it must have been the creek he thought. Sam took off faster now. Dew, though, could not see the creek and was almost depleted of any energy. Sam took one graceful leap across the creek, and made it safely to homeland. Dew staggered behind, panting. Sam also panted, but from the safety of the known land. Sam laughed and turned around to head home when he heard a shrilling scream. He looked back at Dew to see the wolf had, indeed, caught up to them and was mere feets away from Dew.	Dews back was to Sam, and Sam could not do anything to disturb the wolf. He simply must spectate his friends situation. The sun had fallen from the sky, giving way to darkness in the world. Dew slowly stepped back away from the wolf, inching closer and closer to the creek. The wolfs fangs were glaring, even to the point where Sam could see its whiteness cut through the dark. Sam knew that Dew must act fast, or else it would not be good news. He had one solution. He took his backpack off and started running towards the wolf. Dew heard rapid footsteps approaching behind him and yelled. Sam jumped and threw his backpack at the wolf, knocking it down and grabbed Dew with him. They ran back, through the field, and finally, into the house.	Geez boys, I havent seen you all day and you just run into my house like that? Dews mama exclaimed.	Oh you wouldnt know the half of it Mama, Dew sighed.	Alrighty then, get yallselves cleaned, I have supper ready for you, Dews mama smirked.	The boys looked at each other one last time, and headed to the bathroom laughing about the events that had unfolded that day. 	The End. Grandpa sighed.	So thats it? the grandson questioned.	Thats it.	But what about-- Grandpa cut him off before he could finish the sentence.	I think its time for bed now, not time for buts and what ifs, Grandpa said as he tucked his grandson to bed."
Strange(r) love,"Ravi was sitting in the park. Cute little kids were playing in the mud, making castles. Ravi was in a deep thought about his future. Usually, he wont come alone to the park.

I wont disturb you. (Smiles) After an hour Ria came to Ravi. RIA: (exhales) actually my dad was right. RAVI: Ive said it you. Parents always think about our life.

So he didnt.He found a solution for his problem.Peace and happiness everywhere!"
What if Snow White Didnt Eat the Apple?,"Dried leaves crashed under Snow Whites bare feet. Her breathing was labored, her hair was messy and her legs were sore as she ran through the woods. The scent of wet soil hit her nose. A group of vultures hissed as they flew above, creating creepy bird-shaped shadows in front of the red moon. In the distance, the wolves started to howl. Snow White remembered from the books she read that wolves howl after a kill, making her imagine of a dead mans body being feasted by a pack of wolves. Human skin and muscles being torn by beasts sharp teeth. Her skin shuddered at the thought that a few meters away from her location, a human being was satisfying the appetite of hungry predatorsanother victim of the non-ending food chain. Weak preys begging for the mercy of the strong predators. Strong predators becoming victims of another predator much stronger than them. So on. So forth. The cycle never ends. She heard a mighty growl a few feet away from her, and she screamed in terror. She tripped; her face falling flat on the wet soil. The uneven slope caused her to roll on the ground. Stones and torn branches pierced at her skin as her body tumbled downward. Her rolling body slammed on a big cold tombstone, and she winced in pain. Her yellow skirt was so full of mud; it was almost brown. Her blue top was ripped and torn by the branches she passed along the way. Her skin was covered with dirt and wounds. She choked a sob and willed herself to go on. She imagined herself being a dinner for the hungry predators in the woods, and it pushed her to stand up.  The part of the woods where she was in looked like an abandoned cemetery. The trees have long branches without leaves, only bats that were hanging upside down. She expected to see red eyes glaring at her from those leafless branches, but even the bats eyes were lifeless black. In a motion so fast, she did not notice it, a bat frantically flew towards her. It hit the tree beside her with a sickening sound, its wings spread wide as it was plastered on the trunk. Then after a second, it fell slowly to the ground beside her feet, leaving a trail of red blood. She froze. The sick smell of blood and soil hitting her senses. The other bats followed suit and flew in her direction, all at once. She ran, screaming and afraid. Their wings attacked her skin with a painful swat. In the darkness, wild yellow eyes stared hungrily at her, and they seem to be moving closer. She stumbled, her legs giving away beneath her weight. She heard many footsteps behind her: fast, angry, hungry animal footsteps. She ran. She ran until she couldnt breathe. She ran until she could not feel her feet anymore. She ran until her body begged her to stop and rest. She ran until she made it out of the woods and into a tiny cottage.  *** Lets just wake her up and ask her to leave so I can have my bed back. Sleepy yawned as all seven dwarfs stared at the strange lady who laid across all tiny seven beds. Let her stay. We never had a visitor before. Happy said, liking the idea of having a new friend in the cottage. It made him cheerful and giddy. No! Shes a trespasser who thinks invading someones private home is okay. Im not going to put up with that kind of nasty attitude! Grumpy said grumpily as he kicked one of the beds to wake the lady. The stranger kept snoring. Stop it, Grumpy. Doc ordered. No! Grumpy ignored his command and kicked the bed harder. Thats my sleeping bed youre kicking, idiot! Sleepy angrily shouted. Enough! Doc shouted with authority in his voice. All the dwarfs stopped what they were doing. Grumpy rolled his eyes and reluctantly obeyed. Doc gently shook the strangers shoulder, covered in torn blue fabric. The ladys eyes slowly opened, and they roamed to all seven dwarfs. She bolted awake and started to scream, only to choke on air because her throat was too dry. Now young lady, get out of our house, or Ill drag you by the hair! Grumpy shouted while Happy handed the lady a cold glass of water. The cold water soothed Snow Whites dry throat, and she felt better. My name is Snow White. Please let me stay in this cottage. Ill do anything. Wash the dishes. Clean the house. Anything! Please, my stepmother is trying to kill me, and I need your help... On and on, Snow White explained as Sleepy lost interest and decided to sleep on the couch. The dwarfs had a mighty row debating whether to help the stranger or not. In the end, their desire not to do their household chores won over their distress of accepting someone who they barely knew. Grumpy, hating the decision made, walked out of the cottage slamming the door behind him. Snow White proved her worth by making sure the tiny cottage was pristine. The glasses were so clean they sparkled. The bedsheets were so white even the dust would be ashamed to settle on it. The floor was too smooth; you could skate inside the cottage.  Everything was going well for Snow White. The dwarfs were getting attached to her day by day. Even Grumpy seemed to be less grumpy, if that was possible. Dopey was always asking for her kisses when he got home from work. Sneezy gave her the privilege of tying his nose to prevent him from sneezing. Sometimes, Bashful would cuddle on her side and would not say a word. She was worming her way to their hearts, and she couldnt be happier until that day. That day where everything fell apart. It was a sunny day; the dwarfs already went to work in the jewel mines. Snow White hummed as she scrubbed the floor to perfection. The back of her neck prickled, a shiver ran down her spine and a sense of trepidation washed over her. Suddenly, the clouds covered the sun, and the cottage was surrounded by darkness. The warmth and glow Snow White felt before the dwarfs went to work vanished. Knock. Knock. Whos there? Snow White demanded as she left her position on the floor to stand up and approach the door. The wooden door with its harsh carvings and rough surface that Snow White once regarded as cute looked intimidating now. I sell apples. Came the squeaky voice behind the door. Im harmless, dear. I just want to sell apples and make a living. I-Im not hungry. Snow White said, afraid of what could happen once she open that door. I understand if you wont help me sell my apples. I guess its hard for people to trust strangers nowadays. The squeaky voice said, filling her with so much guilt. Days ago, she was in the position of that stranger. She was the untrustworthy stranger who begged for a little trust, a little help. How could she deny the old lady behind the door the second chance that she begged the dwarfs to give her?  Without thinking, she opened the door, and a strong breeze swept her hair, disarranging her red headband. An old lady full of warts and wrinkles greeted her at the door. Behind the lady was the dark forest filled with shadows of unknown creatures. She once again felt the trepidation she felt earlier.  I dont have money, but we have foods in our storage, and we can swap. Snow White offered graciously, taking in the small bony body of the old lady. It reminded her of the witches and ugly villains in her mothers bedtime stories. She chastised herself; appearance is not the be-all and end-all of human beings. Thats good enough for me. Thank you, dear. The old lady smiled, revealing huge yellow teeth with big gaps between each tooth. As Snow White accepted the apple from the old ladys wrinkled but thankfully clean hand, she decided she would give the apple to the dwarfs as a sign of her gratitude. *** Wheres my kiss? Dopey asked Snow White as soon as he entered the door. She laughed and gave him a peck on the cheek. The sun was still hiding beneath the clouds, consuming the cottage in darkness. It started to rain, so Snow White closed the windows and lit a candle, illuminating the cabin in a gloomy orange glow. Overhead, a thunderstorm roar.  The seven dwarfs gathered in their bedroom to rest after a full days work. They slumped on their beds with their working clothes. I bought you something. This is not much, but I want to show my appreciation to you. Snow White gave them the seven slices of apple. The seven dwarfs hurriedly accepted the gift and munched the apple. The juice of the sweet fruit attacked their tongues, and they all moaned in ecstasy. This is so sweet. Where did you get this? Doc asked as rain heavily poured on their roof, almost muting their conversation. An old lady sold it to me. All the seven dwarfs paused midbite. Thunder cracked on the sky as lightning flashed, engulfing the bedroom with brightness for a second. They were looking at her with faces so pale they were almost white. Why? Dopey started choking. His face went red as the veins in his neck protruded. Sleepy opened a window to vomit. The smell and sound of his puking made the other dwarfs winced. Grumpys body convulsed so hard he fell on the floor with a thud, black bubbles forming out of his mouth. Sneezy couldnt breathe. He was suffocating even though the air was whipping at him from the open window. Happy was laughing as he repeatedly hit his head on the wall. Blood sputtered on the wall like a beautiful rose painting. He laughed maniacally as he hit his head harder and faster. Bashful grabbed the plate Snow White used to put the apple, and he dropped it on the floor. The plate shattered into tiny sharp pieces. Bashful wordlessly knelt in front of the shards, and with a hard motion, he pushed his upper body towards the broken pieces until his face fell flat on the fragments. Tiny broken pieces penetrated his skin, lips, and eyes and blood pooled on the floor. Meanwhile, Snow White Snow White was laughing at them as if their possible death gave her immense pleasure. The thunder and her laughter conquered the room together as if they were two lovers dancing in the same rhythm. What have you done? Doc asked grimly as lumps and red tumors appeared on his skin. The tumors were too itchy that he had no choice but to scratch them. The more he scratched the lumps, the more they got itchy. No one helps my enemies and gets away with it. Snow White answered in a squeaky voice as her appearance gradually changed. Her red headband turned into a golden crown. The blue and yellow dress slowly transformed into a violet and black gown. The innocent face of Snow White gradually took a different shape until it fit the profile of the evil queen. At the corner of the room where a closet was located, the dead body of Snow White was hidden inside. Her body started to turn cold as blood poured from her eyes like tears. Small worms danced across her pale, almost grey skin. In her hand was the apple that the old lady insisted she ate. And like a fool, she did."
Jack,"Jack's one bad habit turned out that he had none. He came from a good family of the unassuming respectable sort. Keith and Margaret Richards had come from a long line of midwestern farmers and had over the last few generations graduated to producing the type of midwestern accountants that were known for their steadfastness. Hard work, diligence, and honesty were the hallmarks of the Richards family and for three generations they had born and bread accountants, lawyers, and clerical staff whose lack of imagination was relied upon in the sort of middle income, white collar world that ran the lower to mid office towers of the unfashionable side of a big mid-western city which, in the interests of our narrative, shall remain nameless.  Jack woke up every day, kissed his wife Daisy Richards goodbye, drove his sensible designed in Japan assembled in America with the good gas mileage in to work, and filed taxes for the firm of Peabody, Lionel, and Rotherson. Jack was 34, had ten year old son in the fifth grade, little Johnathan, who was beginning to learn his times tables. Jack and Daisy had married after college and had Johnathan shortly thereafter - it wasn't so much expected as it was the done thing. Daisy herself put on her scrub uniform every morning and drove into work as a nurse. Her locker was adorned with cutesy stickers and animals as it had been all her life. She was, in a word, sweet, and about as unassuming as it was possible to be and still be able to draw blood from her patients. She worked in an orthopedic clinic where there wasn't too much blood and about the most serious ailment that came into the office was a dislocated knee. They both put away from retirement in IRAs that were as sensible as Jack could structure them. They had a small house with a picket fence. Their life path was set in stone - they would work for thirty years or so and then they would retire to a slightly bigger house somewhere warm as their parents had and their parents before them had. It was not so much to call Jack, Daisy, and even maybe little Johnathan, happy as it would be to say that they had no comparison of what life was about. They were happy *enough*.They had enough food to eat and a roof over their heads. They weren't religious per se, Jack liked to mention in casual conversation to anybody that had the misfortune of being in earshot that he came from ""good Christian stock"", although Jack was more interested in his other, more material, accounts. They had a weekly barbecue every Saturday with the neighbors, Max and Mira Drotherson, who lived next door. Max was the owner of the local car dealership in town and while his house was about as cookie cutter as the Richards, although a pale shade of blue than stark yellow, there would always be some exotic car sitting in his drive way that he ""test drove"" before selling them to the public. Mira sold art in town. The art was bad, but people bought it out of charity. Mira had either the foresight or the ignorance to pretend otherwise; it was sort of hard to tell with Mira.  ""Look, Jack,"" Max gesticulated with his beer one Saturday at the end of July when the heat was becoming scorching. Max and Jack were standing in front of the grill cooking weenies while the girls were in the garden. As per usual they were at Jack's house but Max was grilling and Jack was standing watch. They had fallen into this habit, and neither understood why. Jack didn't drink. ""You need to lighten up a little. Get out of town for a while, see the sights. Even up to the Lakes for awhile. I've got just the car that you could rent for a long weekend away for a bit..."" And so the conversation went as it almost always did, with Jack nodding along and murmuring, in his meek and polite way, how now was not the best time. There would have to be arrangements made for a baby sitter for Johnathan and his summer schedule. How much work there was at the office these days.  In fact, the one problem that Jack seemed to be having in his life is that nobody around him respected his need for a certain amount of boring. For Jack, he enjoyed what he had because he had never had the taste of what he could had if he, in the words of some of his colleagues at work, applied a little creativity. Even in the most boring and staid of offices, his boss Mr. Peabody would politely nod his head during the bi-weekly figure reports with a weariness that spoke volumes. People assumed that Jack was insensitive to their emotions, or as the hippies getting high near the lunch trucks might call them, ""vibes"", but Jack wasn't. He just was vibe immune somehow. Stephanie, Mr. Peabody's secretary, consoled him more than once when a fellow clerk was promoted ahead of him. He just needed to show a little more - mojo was the term she used. But they were accounts dang it (that was the word he said to himself as he sometimes kept himself awake at night in his little yellow white picket fence house). They weren't supposed to be interesting, and he liked them that way.  The latest indignity had pushed him over his proverbial edge. His desk had been moved away from his customary position near a window to let a much younger clerk, a junior, into his spot and he had been banished to the middle of the office where there was much less privacy. Jack valued his privacy, he valued that his day to day life had a certain uniform consistency, and he valued not being humiliated in front of his peers. Damn the window (this time he really meant it), it was the indignity of it all. All his life he had done what others told him to do because they more or less fell in line with his expectations. But for some reason that he couldn't really fathom that wasn't working any more, so he began, for the first time in his life, to become cunning.  One Saturday Jack convinced Max to lend him one of his high powered sports cars for the week. Jack, who on principle refused to lie, in keeping with his family tradition, told him that he was just looking for a change. Max jumped at the idea. For him the cars were free rides and he secretly liked the idea of thinking that he knew his neighbors secret, that Jack was having an affair downtown. Max liked to think he knew things and Jack did not go so far as to completely banish the idea from his mind. On that Monday he drove into work in a car that was worth easily ten times what his sensible Asian compact was worth.  News around the office spread like wildfire. Stephanie looked at him with new found respect and began playing with her pencils when she talked with him. The junior accounts manager that had taken his chair deferred to him in a completely trivial matter and Mr. Peabody, bald headed paunchy Mr. Peabody practically gushed over figures that hadn't changed significantly over the last week. Jack, to add fuel to the rumors, carefully added a doctored spreadsheet showing exponential growth in some obscure stock. Jack did not lie, but if any of the partners or associates were to happen to walk across his terminal when he was roaming the halls that wasn't exactly his problem either.  On a Friday the partners took Jack out to lunch and effused over his performance. Jack carefully noted what they ate (steak and salad) and what beer they drank (an import of a variety that closely matched the pedigree of his loaner vehicle). He ordered a smaller steak and a beer. This seemed to please the partners and they were quick to enjoy him to a more senior role within the firm, one came with an office and a door.  At weeks end, Jack returned the car to Max and the following week happily moved his small office belongs, a cactus, lamp and calculator into his new office. No mention was made of the car which had disappeared from his parking space other than a few looks that suggested some slight betrayal. Stephanie stopped twirling her pencil, but also stopped consoling him as an equal - he now became Mr. Richards with a cold brusqueness. Other than this his normal duties more or less resumed.  Yet...the hours were longer and the figures involved became both more and less serious. Jack's role became less about accounting and more about having to manage people, which involved learning more about food than he would have cared to admit. Over the next few weeks he began having to learn about the gastro sensibilities of the other managing firms in town and their clientele. The reason for this was simple - the accounts of Peabody, Lionel and Rotherson did not balance and as Jack was beginning to understand most of the accounting books in town, maybe even all the accounts in the world, or at least it seemed to Jack, might not balance. It started with a simple phone call over some tractor supplies to a manufacturing firm that had off balance sheet items that were not listed anywhere in any way. Bounced from one representative to another Jack quickly found that the only way to gain any traction was to call up a sales rep which involved another steak dinner. Chad from Feed Supply Unlimited. An explanation was given over tartar sauce that seemed reasonable enough. Jack submitted his report, Mr. Peabody was pleased and he moved on to other work.  That was the beginning. The life that Jack had envisioned - honesty, integrity - started to quickly become mired in the reasonableness of his clients. Jack could not, would not for his own principle sake become involved in a lie, but he was forced, time and again to call up clients to explain their discrepancies in their accounts. From tractor wholesalers to lampshade dealers, Jack would be forced to find ways to excuse the profligacy of the accounts he was handed. And the explanations always made sense at the end of the day, there was no denying that. But Jack was having other problems. His waistline was expanding and he began to have bags under his eyes. The looks that Max gave him that summer were beginning to rub off on Daisy who looked at Jack with a side eye every now and again. The extra money and the promotion sounded too good to be true to her and the extra hours away at the office and the way that Jack came home every day exhausted and smelling of alcohol could only, to her sensibilities, mean one thing - that Jack was cheating on her. Daisy didn't say anything - in fact she was her old normal cheerful self, but she rolled away from him at night and more often than not she ""got headaches"". Jack had traded away his simple life of honest toil for money. His wife wasn't honest with him, what amounted to his friends thought he was having an affair, his clients were not honest. How could he then live an honest life? And so a hot sweltering night filled with sleeplessness found Jack out in front of his yellow lemon house taking a baseball bat to his sensible asian compact with the good gas mileage."
A Pleasant Detour,"The oak rocking chair creaked with age as I settled into it, the padded surfaces cushioning my old body.  I chuckled to myself as I could almost feel my own bones squeak and grind in rhythm with the rocking. Whenever the grandkids visit, I almost forget about my age, feeding off their seemingly infinite youthful energy as they bounce around the house, chased after by my dear son and his wife. Come on now, Francis, my son, Jayce, called to the chubby eight-year-old, And Anastasia! Quit hanging Edith upside down! I know she loves it but its time for papas story time! The eldest daughter, recently turned twelve, spun the giggling two-year-old upright again and brought the squirming baby to rest to me. Edith was smart for her age, already able to understand complex conversations and interact with them. At the mention of story time, she eagerly reached for me. I obliged and sat her on my lap, patting her rich-brown hair that cascaded in curls down her face. I wove stowy time! She exclaimed, her bright eagerness bringing a fresh breath of energy to me. I couldnt help but smile and pinch her cheeks. I know you do, pea. I told her. My daughter-in-law was still in the kitchen, adamant to clean the dishes from lunch before anything else. Now then, I cleared my throat, Which way did you take to get here? Anastasia gave me an odd look. The usual way, pappa, She said, matter-of-factly, Off the highway, right onto Seventh, left on Rim, left at the first left, take the first right, then straight here! Her sense of direction was impeccable.Good, good, I commended her, But did you know, that instead of that last right, you could still reach the house going straight?  But wont that take longer? She huffed. Francis, not wanting to be left out, also copied his sister, Yeah, poppa! He said, Why go the long way? Theres a playground with a nature walk down there, I told them. Immediately their eyes went wide in excitement. A park, a park! exclaimed Edith, bouncing up and down on my lab. Weve been here a lot, poppa, why didnt you tell us about the park? The childrens lips were pouting in unison, their warm brown eyes filled with childish hurt at the idea of being deprived of fun. Whoa, now, I brought my hands up in supplication, I figured one day youd decide to explore around a bit. In fact, let me tell you a very important story to your poppa.  I had their full attention now, pouty faces down. I cleared my throat again, and as if on cue, a mug of water appeared on the small coffee stand beside me; Gertrude had finished cleaning the dishes.  Thank you, I said, taking a good swig of cool water. Gertrude joined her kids on the living room carpet, sitting cross-legged between Anastasia and Francis, who each subconsciously held her arms. When I was but a young lad in the city, I began, I had a very set schedule. Wake up at six, change, breakfast, then leave my little apartment for work. It was a busy city, and the fastest route took twenty minutes at most to walk just a few blocks to the office. I would get there with time to spare, do my time, and return home, grabbing a coffee from the Dunkin that I would pass along the way. I did that for almost a year, with little change in my schedule. I could tell that their attention was about to break, which was my cue to engage them once more. What do you think about that, kids? Edith yawned in my lap. Booowiiing, She said, I dont think I wud like papa if he was that bowing. I chuckled again. Exactly, I said sharply, Your papa  quite boring doing the same things over and over again. Thats why, one day, I got tired of being boring. I lowered my voice to almost a whisper, as if about to tell the kids a secret, Do you know what your papa did? I saw the young Francis gears put two and two together. You went a different way! He exclaimed. I clapped my hands together. Preeecisely! I croaked out.  I laughed as I chugged down some more water. Edith beamed excitedly at me, eagerly waiting to hear more. So, I went another way, I continued, One day after work, I finally had enough. Instead of the normal, straight shot down the block walk back home, I turned right to make my way back from the other side of the block. Its just the other side, I told myself, Theres no way I could get lost. Did you get lost, papa? asked Edith. I shook my head. Not at all, pea, I said, But I was surprised to find all the different stores and buildings that Ive missed on the other side for almost a whole year! I lifted Edith up and slightly tossed her in the air. She giggled. What did you find, poppa? she asked, wide eyed. So many things! I said, Clothing stores, small business brands, a cute little trinket shop, a small clearing on the sidewalk for some street performances, and more! It was the weekend, and I had all the time in the world to explore, so I did just that! I pointed to a mantelpiece in the living room, littered with little figurines. Many of those came from the trinket shop on that street. I tapped the coffee table besides me, And this came from a local woodworker on that street. The kids had a ball pointing at various objects in the living room, asking if they came from the other side of the block. At last, it was Jayce who piped up. Dad, what about your mug? He said with a wink. ,I thought with pride. The kids were brought to focus once more, and I continued my story. There was this local coffee shop, you see, I pointed to the faded logo of a cup with a fissure down the middle, rich brown liquid spilling out, The Cracked Cup, a small caf I also discovered exploring the new route. I had passed it earlier that day, so I made my way back to see what they had. The smell of coffee beans was far stronger than ol Dunkin. I remember gazing at the handwritten chalkboard menu with awe. In the end, I took one of the baristas advice and sat down to drink my very first Turkish coffee. Let me tell you now, it was even better than Id ever imagined! The cozy atmosphere, unique coffee, and wood-paneled room just brought me into a whole new world of enjoying coffee! They even had a few bookcases of used books their patrons could browse through while drinking their coffee; it was an amazing place, but then I trailed off, causing the kids to hold their breath in anticipation, I saw What was it, papa? Francis whispered, almost breathlessly. Their gazes bored into me. In the corner of the ceiling close to the entrance, was a small TV. It played on mute, showing local news, and thats when a familiar set of buildings caught my eye. It was my apartment buildingand it was on fire! I sat up straight in my rocking chair, to mimic the surprise I would have felt back then. My eyes popped! My little apartment, on fire! I bolted out of the coffee house in a mad dash down the blocks leading to the scene; I mustve looked like a madman. I arrived at the scene of a nightmare. The fire department was already there, doing their best to quench the roaring flames. All I could do was stand there in shock with the spectating crowd. Was everyone okay? Anastasia asked. Sadly, a number of people that were in the apartments died from the fire, Her eyes teared up a bit in sympathy, I would have been amongst them, since my room was pretty high up. If I had gone the same way I always had, papa would never have been here. But that wasnt the only thing that happened that day. Is it something sad too? Ediths little lips were shaking. I gently rubbed her head. Thankfully not! When I shook off the shock of the events, I decided to call my boss to inform them of my dilemma, but I realized I left in such a hurry, I forgot my phone and bag! I was about to make my way back but I was stoppedby the barista! She had seen me leave my things in a rush and decided to chase after me. I thanked her for her kindness, and she smiled. And there, kids, was when your papa really met your mama for the first time. The children were beaming, including Jayce. So! What did we learn today, kids? Edith bounced up and down on my lap. Expwore, expwore! Dont be boring! said Francis. If its meant to happen, it will. Anastasia said, dreamily caught up in her young fantasy. Good, good! I said, Now, theres still plenty of sunlight today. Who wants to go to the park? The little living room exploded in cheers and happy whoops as the kids jumped all around with renewed energy. I tried to do the same, but realized my old frame seemed glued to the cushions of the oak rocking chair. Anyone wanna help me out of this?"
Sandrita,"The smell of homemade fried chicken and small, microwaved okra wafted in through Sandritas window. She sat behind her curtain and watched her neighbors run from their apartment to the car. They were helping their mom get the groceries, and even though Sandrita knew it was a small thing in their day, she wished she could help someone carry food into the kitchen. She wished she could put on her mothers big high heels, like the oldest neighbor boy had, and feel the crunch of soft gravel as she balanced plastic bags of orange juice and milk in each hand. Sandrita wanted to eat homemade fried chicken and she wanted to watch the microwave okra spin in the machine, getting hotter and more delicious by the minute. But sandrita couldnt. There was no way she could leave this room, no matter how empty it was. Once upon a time, there was a bed in here. There was a lamp by the floor and a little refrigerator that plugged into the wall. Sandrita used to flick the lamp on and off, on and off, until one day it shut down entirely and when she woke up the next morning, it was gone, just like her bed and the refrigerator and the fourteen stuffed animals her mother gave her. She missed the rabbit the most because it was soft and the ears were made of silky satin. She missed the time when this was a guest room, and not a cell.	The neighbor children were nice, Sandrita thought, to always wave at her when they saw her peeking through the curtains. She could still remember their names, even though it had been so many years since theyd seen each other on the other side of this window, this wall. It wasnt fun anymore for Sandrita to pretend there was some crazy fairy tale reason she was in this room. There was no reason to imagine herself as some beautiful princess, guarded away from the world and waiting for someone to save her. When she was younger, she used to pretend- lie to herself, really- that there was a mysterious person coming to rescue her on a pretty white horse or, at the very least, a large dog. Then one day, Sandrita woke up to find her last stuffed animal gone and she realized with a sudden, greater sadness that she would never be able to leave, regardless of who came to get her. There were some things that she just wasnt going to get away with, or get away 	Today, though, she wanted to watch her neighbors and smell their dinner. The oldest boy, Kilkini, looked up at her window and smiled, waving. He was still wearing his moms high heels and his shirt was too big, it swung past his knees and overlapped the bottom of his shorts. Sandrita wondered if he played basketball, or if they only had the net out in the yard for decoration. It was strange to see people laughing, moving, playing, going on and on without her as she rotted away in her little empty guest room, bare walls and locked door to match her bare feet and locked mouth. She was so quiet. What was there to say and besides that, who would she ever say it to?	When her parents first closed the door, Sandrita had a tiny bird. She called it Choi. It would sing to her and fill the silence and sometimes, sometimes, it was enough to keep her busy. And then one day she woke up and Choi was singing no more, never to sing again. The little bird had died. And Sandrita felt herself die a little more with it. She wished there was a song in her room now. She wished there was a song in her heart, too, or a bright light in her eyes. She wouldnt know anyway, there wasnt a mirror. There was nothing she could do to make the light come back, or the song, or her soft way of speaking. There was a time, of course, when she couldnt stop talking. She told her thoughts, no matter how bitty they were, to her mother, her father, her friends and her sister.	Her sister.	The reason Sandrita was locked in her empty guest room.	The very pretty, slightly older, very dead sister.	Trilina.	Sandrita blinked away the memory of her sister and focused on the smell of her neighbors dinner. It was wonderful to know that even if she wouldnt be able to join her family at the table again, someone else could.	Hey!	Sandrita jumped. This boy, the oldest one, was talking to her through the window. Hey, hi!	She didnt answer. She couldnt open the window. She waved to Kilkini. He grinned and hopped back inside his apartment, where she couldnt see him again. She leaned closer to the window and pressed her palms flat against the glass. There was sunshine out there. She wanted to feel it better. Sandrita ran her fingers along the bottom of the window pane, but there was no way to open it. It was nailed shut, like most things in this room.	Sandrita.	Yes?	Her mother was at the door with her food.	I have your dinner, will you come get it?	Yes. On my way.	Her mother slid a tray under the door and Sandrita caught it with both hands. It was cold and there was no smell to it at all, so vastly unlike the chicken and okra kilkini and his siblings were no doubt enjoying this moment. Are you doing alright today, honey?	Can I leave?	There was a sharp silence, as though her mother was breathing in, and then, No, thats ridiculous. Youre in there to be safe. You know that.	I didnt mean to hurt anyone.	I know. But you did.	And Sandrita knew she had, but that didnt make the days any shorter, or the smell of delicious fried chicken fade any less. She was still alone and she could still feel the ribs of that loneliness ebbing away at her insides, taking her apart as one would, well, a piece of crispy, fresh, fried chicken."
A Tale of Two Towns,"Once there was a town called Misery. It was a town full of anger, strife, and heartache. The buildings leaned like drunken sailors, propped up against each other. Cries of anger, pain, and sadness filled the air. The people of this place were mean, petty, cruel, and vicious. They lived like pigs in their own filth. They were drunk most of the time and spitting mad the rest. It needs not to be said that the town had no visitors, for no one likes to dwell in Misery. Instead they would stay in places like Fortune and Fame and Success.Until one day, from who knows where, a stranger arrived in Misery, dressed in a bright red coat. The people of Misery all came out to stare, gawking from windows and doors. The children threw stones and the adults hurled insults at this new person in red. The stranger hurried past the crowd that was forming, into Miserys only inn. The inn was dirty, dark, and dingy, because, of course, there were no visitors. You should have seen the inn-owners face when the stranger in red asked for a room. He handed over the key and with a look of dismay, he watched the stranger walk away, up the stairs and into a room that had never before seen any use.Later on, the stranger left and went out to look about the town. Again the people mocked and jeered as the stranger ducked into a greasy restaurant. The cook stared from behind the counter as the stranger in the red coat sat down and ordered a meal. The cook served the stranger, then was called by a man at a nearby table,This meat is too tough, said the man.And mine is stone-cold! called a woman.This isnt what I ordered! yelled another.The harried cook shook his fists and shouted at them, If you dont like it then leave! And some people did just that. Soon, the stranger finished the meal and waved the cook over.What is it now? said the cook, Was it too stringy, or dry or disgusting? Because too bad for you, we dont offer refunds!No, no, said the stranger, Its not that at all. The meal was delicious and Id like to thank you.The cooks mouth hung open as the stranger stood up and left. The figure in red went back to the inn and spent the night there. In the morning, the stranger left, headed for lands far abroad. But the cook remembered the compliment paid to him and tried to pass it on. When a woman outside his restaurant dropped the packages she was carrying, he went outside and helped her pick them up.The woman was shocked, no one had done something like that for her before, not in Misery. So she, in turn, helped her neighbor hang up her laundry. The neighbor was amazed, she had always thought that the woman hated her because of an old fight they had had long ago.Because of the love shown to her, the neighbor went and told her father, who she had not seen in years, that she loved him. The father broke down in tears and told his daughter that he loved her too. The father then went and apologized to his wife about an argument they had had. His wife forgave him and hugged him tightly.Then she went and helped the elderly widow next door to weed her garden. The widow felt loved for the first time in a long time. When she went out shopping that day, she told the teenage girl who rang up her purchases how pretty she was. That girl had just broken up with her boyfriend and was feeling worthless and ugly. No one had ever called her beautiful before, not in Misery.The next day the girl thanked her teacher as she left the class. The teacher was amazed, she had thought all of the students slept through her class. In fact, she had been considering quitting the job she loved because she felt that she was a bad teacher.Later, that teacher saw a little boy crying on the playground. She went and hugged him and held him while he cried. The boys mother had just died and he was so sad that it hurt. The hug reminded him that the world was not completely dark and made him begin to feel like he could be happy again.After school, the boy went home and played with his little sister, even though they usually argued and fought constantly. This made his father so happy that he took them out for a special dinner and complimented the cook on his food.From then on, love and happiness grew. People started to help each other and be kind and generous. People started to realize that they actually one another. They began to clean up the town and make it look nicer. Most of the buildings were rebuilt or repainted, and the ones that werent were torn down to make room for the new parks and playgrounds. People started to come together to celebrate and to have fun. The town gained a new life, and everyone was affected by it. They elected a mayor who was kind and fair, who renamed the town after what it had become.Years later, a stranger wearing a tattered red coat traveled to a town called Joy. The stranger was greeted heartily, and welcomed into the large, bustling inn. The inn-keeper vaguely recognized the stranger, but thought nothing of it. Joy had many visitors these days. The stranger went to a restaurant nearby and ate a delicious meal. The stranger stayed at the inn for a night, then departed in the morning. The stranger looked back as he left, I could have sworn that this was the town called Misery that I visited so long ago, but it cant be. This town is called Joy."
Tale of Opera jungle,"The stranger's letterThere was a boy who lives ina city?The name of the city was Dopasha city. Thename of the boy was Vopu. He was an intelligent boy. His age was 13 years. His house was a lovely house. For only mother, father and Vopu live in the house. The name of Vopu father was Astricka. And he was a teacher. And Vopu mother name was Kaushalya. The Vopu was always friendly in relation and work. He reads infive standers in the school. As the name of the school was""James School"". And as a true teacher his father and mother also posted in the same school ""James School"". Vopu reads very well. When he returns at home he always sees his home post box situated at the door of his house that any letter is present or not? Which always, he sees blank?For Vopu's mother Kaushalya told the Vopu to keep the attention of her home post box.It is the story of one day, when Vopu was returning at his home from the school? He checked the post box of his home. But he found a letter. It was when opened? Then it was written that-Vopu I am a stranger man. Who only needs an answer from you that - our Princess of another world of magic will marry a good prince or not?If yes then write me at the following address :- ""The third level"" After discovering me from the above address. I will come at you and we will be a good friend. If you like not to write, then we will be stranger only. The address was very short.So Vopu reads the address and he does not believe in that three word address. He also thinks that this mistrey of strange person is secret. So it needs him to open the secret,of that letter. So he decided to give the answer of that letter.So he opened his copy from the school bag and wrote a letter, that he is saying yes. Also Vopu wants to know the position of their magical world and what is the address of magical world. And also he wants to know about their princess.Then after writing letter Vopu posted his letter to a near post office in which the address was only three letter words that was ""The third level"". -------------- The failure of magical letter So after few days the letter reached at the stranger person of Opera jungle. He was a small rat. The rat was knowing that if he will open and read the letter then he might be boycott from his jungle Opera. So he reached at the magician of the jungle Opera. And it was possible that both magician and rat has written the letter. And the letter was based on true crisis of Opera jungle. For the jungle princess was evil. She was an evil because it was the effect of dark magic which was done by an evil witch. The witch came from somewhere. And came at the day of marring our Princess Sade. Our Princess Sade was not knowing that she will be bound in the spell of dark magic. Which was done by the Shark witch? So it was already happened.The magician name of the Opera jungle was Finn. Who wrote a magical letter to Vopu boy? And it was a good magic done by Vopu. And according to magic it was done yes in the letter by the Vopu boy. After his following yes in the letter it will be supposed that it will blossom a colour magical flower present at the magician Finn. Whose magic can read the wrong effect of princess Sade? Also the letter address was magical address which was ""The third level""? So the flower blossomed after reading the letter. All this was watching the rat and magician Finn. So before plucking the flower the rat automatic began to laugh evil. Because it was all the dark effect of the dark magic which spreads at the rat by evil witch? As it was believe that the dark magic of witch has taken many animals life. It was a powerful magic which how spread no one was knowing? And who will be sick before dark magic of witch no one knows? So the rat after converting in to evil attacked on magical flower. The magician Finn had not believed that his friend rat will be the evil with the effect of dark magic. So rat plucked the flower immdieatly and chewed it all and all that it happened that to be undone. After eating the flower by the rat. He again converted in to a good soul. For the flower contain the good magic. But there was no help came to Princess Sade. So magician Finn was only knowing that now there is no any possibility of princess who will be converted in to a good soul? And she must marry with a right prince.- .---------An angel The complain of dark magic reached to angel. For it was spread densely. And also the news of rat and magician Finn had been known. There was a bird who was prison made after her mistake. Actually the mistake was that that she helps the witch to learn dark magic? And that bird was from heaven. So the shelter of heaven people who was angel arrested the bird and made prison before him?Thus magician Finn invoked the angel from heaven. The angel came and they decided the situation of Opera jungle. The angel told the magician Finn if she will meet the boy Vopu and made him friend and if the boy works according to the task of angel then it might be possible that the princess Sade health will be corrected and she might be freed from dark magic and she will marry a good man. So magician Finn and angel came at the Vopu boy in the city Dopasha. At that time Vopu was playing in the garden. Vopu was catching the butterfly in the garden. And both angel and magician Finn was hiding at the side of the tree. Then it began the task of an angel. Who had ananother red flower of heaven which will bloom only by the touch of the Vopu? So an angel and magician Finn came infront of Vopu and they told that they are not stranger. For they are friend according to the letter written by him. So all three body became a closed friend and Vopu touched the red flower. And the flower bloomed. Only this possible story then came in Opera world in front of the princess Sade. Princess Sade after converted in to good soul with the help of red flower and finished the dark magic. Princess Sade defeated the fight between the Shark witch and her. And she kept the witch in to prison. And she married a young good prince. After that everything happened good in Opera jungle world."
A Unicorn's Decision,"Lawrence the unicorn was exhausted. Hed been traveling the continent searching for more of his kind.Finding even just  other of his kind would satisfy this great and heavy need. 	He had roamed all the way down through Alaska to King Cove, then all the way north to Utqiagvik.He had made his weary way across the Northwest Territories to Nunavut, then down through every Canadian Province to the tip of Newfoundland, to a little town called Blanc Sablon.His coat grew as shaggy as the wild mountain horses of the vast white tundra of the horseshoe, not quite polar bearish but thick and warm. 	Outside the town of Porte La Prairie just past Winnipeg he met a herd of wild horses whose leader was chestnut stallion so huge his shoulders were a foot higher than Lawrences.His name was Kubrik and he seemed a bit mad.He was brave and smart but not entirely fearless.For in the horse world, fearless meant stupid.He introduced the unicorn to his herd, and he shared his grassy knoll.It was spring and the females were randy. 	After eating his fill, Lawrence tentitavely approached Sabre, a young mare with a pearly white coat like his.She consented.She was feisty and nipped at him as he mounted her, arousing him more.They lay in the tall, soft grass, steam lazily wafting from their damp muscular bodies. 	The lovely mare asked, Must you leave?Lawrence answered, Yes my love.I can not rest until I either find another of my kind or die trying.Besides, the stallions in your herd dont like me.Why do you say that? Sabra asked, then added, Kubrik likes you.I hear them whispering about my horn, they think Im a freak.And Kubrik eats toadstools and sees little green men swinging from dogwood branches.Hahaha, that he does.But the rest of the stallions are just jealous!But they are right, I am a freak!There is no other horse with a horn on their forehead! Lawrence the stoic revealed his weak side to the mare.She only sighed and nuzzled his neck, realizing he had many demons inside to conquer. 	Lawrence continued on his quest.He walked down past the great lakes and into the USA where he then headed back east through Minnestota, both Dakotas, and into Montana. 	Just outside Fort Benton, he came across a group of spirited fillies playing in a field. Alas, the field was fenced so he hid in the woods until dark.He rolled in mud to hide his shining white coat.A full moon ruled the sky, and he would have glowed like a beacon.There was a horse in the field whose coat indeed glowed- she was an ethereal beauty, a mare for Diana to ride through the heavens! He gracefully leapt the wooden pickets and was mesmerized by the white filly as he approached her. 	She looked up from her grazing and laughed at him. Why are you covered in mud?Lawrence then understood her amusement, hed forgotten about the mud.Its camouflage.I dont want any humans trapping me, Im on a mission you seeHe told her of his long and seemingly futile quest.He didnt mention that hed rather not be seen by any of the other herd members.They would jeer at his horn and call him names before running him off their field. 	When he finished talking, the mare said, The human family is away this week.The caretaker is a lazy drunk, he often forgets to put us in the stables at night.We like it better out here anyways, because the man rarely lifts a pitchfork to our stalls. 	The field was over ten acres long.  Babs, the beautiful white mare, led Lawrence to a private corner far from the others. 	He left her sleeping in the tall untended grass in the wee hours of morning.It was pitch black and silent as a gravestone except for the soft whooting from the trees ahead.The owl seemed to be talking to him, asking, Who who whooooo are you?Where do yoooou belong?Are yooou real? 	As he walked, the cosmos above the world brightened from the deepest azure to bright robins egg.The mud became itchy as it dried in the sun.When he came to a still green pond in the woods he peered in at his reflection. 	Oh my goodness! he thought, Im a hobo!He cleansed himself in the pool.The invigorating water woke his senses and he continued on his quest with renewed energy. 	Lawrence walked down the coast all the way to the tip of the Baja Peninsula, and then back all through Mexico.During his travels through the warm climates, his coat once again grew sleek, the thick shaggy white fur molted away, and he enjoyed the heat on his back.	He travelled all the way down to El Quique then came back up the coast and into Argentina.There he met a wonderfully wild herd of plains ponies.They were as spirited as the sprites of spring.And as generous as the best of the horse breeds hed met.They shared their sweet green grass and a special one that only grew in their land, it was red and stained their muzzles like kisses from the devil.They had heard of unicorns but always thought them myth. This was depressing and exhilarating at the same time. 	Amongst their herd he met the princess of them.A pearl white pony, her coat so shimmering, it shone blueish in the twilight.Few words were spoken aloud, her eyes gave him her consent. 	In the afterglow of their lovemaking, the pretty pony, Jeni, asked, Why must you leave?Youve been so far and wide without sign of your own kind.Cant you settle here?And be with me?Lawrence said, I do not feel welcome here.The stallions talk behind my back and make jests towards me in public. 	They are jealous!Can you not see that?I just want to fit in!I feel so alone! Lawrence shook his mane in frustration.He needed to decide some things.He thought his best profound thoughts while walking, so he headed off the next morning before any of the stallions awoke. 		Lawrence walked all the way to Argentina.In Argentina, he found a wild mustang herd.The elders of the tribe had heard many fascinating tales about unicorns.Maidre, one of the elders said, Though we have heard the tales, we didnt think they really existed.But of course they existed, I am one. Lawrence said.Maidra replied, Yes! Here you are! I can die happy now, knowing unicorns are real!But Im the only one!Im not like the other horses and they hate me for it! cried Lawrence.The elder said, For someone so old as you, and so travelled, you still have so much to learn. 	Lawrence left the meadow of the great mustang elders and pondered his dilemma.He was not like them.He was different.He had a horn in the middle of his forehead. Once, many centuries ago, the males of his species had used the horns to attack and fight over the fair females who were hornless.Lawrence never wanted to attack another horse, it would be unfair.He wanted to belong with a herd.He wanted to fit in. 	When he got to Brazil he came across a wild herd of Andalusians.They were his size and shape.Their princess took a liking to Lawrence immediately.She was sleek and strong, with a shiny coat nearly all white except for a scattering of soft grey freckles on her hindside.Her long silky mane and tail the same dove grey.Her name was Bella. 	She said to Lawrence, please stay with our herd.Ive never met any horse like you.I want to be your mate forever.The unicorn said, Im so tired and I have known only loneliness for so long, I wish I could settle here with youbut your herd leader hates me.He feels threatened by my horn.I have no desire to usurp him, but he doesnt trust me.Gammal is my father, he wants me to be happy.He is quite old now and wishes me to rule the herd.I cant do it alone, no mare would ever be as respected as a stallion.I have a tough decision to make. Lawrence announced as he turned away from her.I pray you decide in my favor Lawrence.She said to his back as he clopped away. 	Lawrence walked into a forest and found a strong sturdy tree.He rammed the tree with his horn, it sank halfway into its bark.Then he shook his head, his powerful neck snapped off the horn with a reverberant crack.He galloped back to the herd.He went to the princess mare and bowed low. 	Bella said, What have you done?!Lawrence replied, I want to settle here with you!And your tribe.Im done my quest.There are no more unicorns.I cant be with you now!I loved you for your uniqueness, the horn made you a legend.Now you are just another horse. She sighed heavily. 	You should have become our leader, with me, as queen at your side.Lawrences long silken mane trembled with disbelief.Dumbfounded, he slowly plodded away into a herd that welcomed him as family. Bellas father chose a suitable young stallion for her, and life on the plains was peaceful.Gammal left on his funeral journey shortly afterwards, the horses would not see him again until thier own journey was complete. 	Lawrence lived peacefully within the herd, the stallions his friends and allies, and the mares like sisters.He was content, and grew quite old.His eyesight was failing and his ears twitched with palsy.In his great heart remained an immense loneliness. 	What else should I have done? he lamented night after night before lifting off to the macrocosm of dreams. 	One day he felt the winged warrior, the death-stallion, silently bearing down upon him.It was time for his funeral journey.He clopped up the Warriers Hill, past the ancient pines and the whispering yellow meadow grass, to where all the herd go to die.Hed earned his right to die there by becoming one of them. 	As he lay down for his final rest, Bella came to him. 	She said, Lawrence, please open your weary eyes one last time. 	Lawrence, who had been lamenting on his bad decision for the last time, opened his eyes.They were out of focus, though he imagined he saw six pure white stallions gathered around Bella who was smiling, 	These children have been searching the continent for their father and in doing so, found each other along the way. 	Lawrences old eyes finally focused as he came back from the brink of the Heavenly Path to the Promised Pasture. 	The six young horses before him ranged in age from mere foals to full grown young stallions.Their coats were radiating snowy white in the low dusk light...	And he gasped when he saw that each one had a pointed, spiraled horn growing from his forehead!They were the handsomest, most alluring creatures hed ever seen.He knew they would hear all about his legendary travels and the terrible decision hed foolishly made.And he felt in his heart that none of them would make the same mistake.."
Wethersbys Wakening,"Sir John Wethersby, for the life of him, could not recall which town he was in, nor in what quaint innkeepers room he had suddenly awakened. The last thing he could recall, was hearing the distant mewing of a spectral cat, after partaking of a particularly bland bowl of porridge, and a rather unsavory piece of stale mutton. But why could he not recall anything from even a few days past?Sir John, managed to get dressed, in a quite stylish set of breeches and long tail coat, previously unfamiliar to him. He made his way down the rickety, uneven steps of the narrow oaken staircase, which led to a small room containing a bar set up and a few modest seating arrangements. After calling out, in vain, nary a soul to be found, he headed out the large stalwart steel-enforced door into the sun-bleached street, of the still, unfamiliar, hamlet.Here and there, a few civilians went about their everyday, mundane tasks. What with the work of leading cows to pasture, or sweeping sidewalks, there seemed to be a vague malaise about the place, which fogged Johns mind in a veneer of mystery. Not a soul meet eye contact with him, nor did they even take notice, as if he may not have even been present at all. He couldnt quite place it, but if he had to guess, the dialect with which they spoke to each other had the resonance of Gaelic sounding tones.Finally after walking down unfamiliar cobblestone streets, with unpronounceable names, in a foreign script, he decided he would take charge of his current predicament. It was then that he saw the door to the Grimalc Inn was wide open, with a sign beckoning patronage for those in want of a hearty meal and a grand old time.Sir John reticently stepped across the golden inlay of the establishments threshold, only to be quite taken aback by the glorious sight that beheld his eyes. There before him, in what would have been considered a quite normal Irish eatery otherwise, was instead one embellished with a mountain of intricate decorum from floor to vaulted ceiling. Every incarnation, idol and effigy of fairy, cherub, woodland creature and spirit, adorned the place, carved in everything from porcelain, to fine silver and gold, to ivory, as well as rare and exquisite wood from a seemingly enchanted forest.John laid his hat upon the table as he stared up at the incredible and the unfathomable images before him. He rubbed his temples in disbelief at the mere thought of the handiwork, and hours of labor, that must have went into the creation and collection of such a menagerie. It was only then that he noticed the pleasant Maiden, who had been staring at him the entire time. She seemed tall for a woman, with long flowing fiery curls, as red as volcanic fire. Her ample bosom and resplendent curves were welcoming In a way that was neither fully matronly or sexual, but whole-heartedly appealing, nonetheless. Her smile shined like a beacon, and she had a bronze glow about her, like that of a pregnant woman, although she was not with child.John was inwardly startled, at first, but something beyond him beckoned him to engage the middle-aged maiden with all of his very being. After a brief swallow, and some inner self-encouragement, he chose to speak first. His tone was solemn, as if in a church or on hallowed ground, though he knew not why he spoke as such.Pardon me, fair lass. But could thou tell me of what land I am in, and how far is it from the Queens, for I am, as of yet, unfamiliar of its trappings.The Maiden continued her busy work of polishing chalices and crystal goblets, although it was clear she offered her full attention to the perplexed man. The words, she spoke were in an accent so strong, yet somehow Sir John, understood them all, if only in his minds eye, and not altogether on the surface.She spoke of a land of enchantment. Of a decision to continue to seek out the elusive, or to perhaps settle in the here and now. Her smile was mischievous, and the glint in her eyes tempestuous. John felt as if he were a sailor starring at a Siren, not knowing if he would experience unbridled sensuality or be dashed upon the rocks. Opposing feelings of fear and inquisitiveness clashed inside of him, lapping like tumultuous waves at his rib cage. The more she spoke, the more he became intrigued, until he felt hopelessly enamored and unequivocally beguiled by her aura and words.John felt himself slipping from the mortal coil, to go down a path of no return. He felt as though his body hung, now perilously, on the precipice of a large drop into the bottomless pit of the cosmos. He struggled between trepidation and curiosity, the fair Maidens charms now enthralling him beyond simply mere carnal desires. All he needed to do was let go.The harsh cry of a flustered feline broke John from her gaze. It had been the same cats cry that led him to this far away land of mystery, mirth and perhaps malevolent spirits, in the first place. But this time when John awakened, he was not in a far-off land of Irish folklore, but rather the creature comforts of his own bed. Like Ebenezer before him, he laughed until he cried, as his furry feline friend licked her white and beige paws, before bathing her own ears awash, and John in her indifference.John now fully awake, sucked air through his teeth, happy to be alive.Never again would he forget the indescribable Grimalc Inn, nor its seductive unearthly inhabitant that took the female form. He knew not where he had traveled during his unconscious state, but only that even the furthest reaches of his intelligence and experience combined,could never have imagined such a place, even in a lucid dream state.He knew not its name, or language; nor could be place any of its vaguely familiar, although hauntingly unfamiliar, traits. All he knew was, heavenly or hellish, that place had not been of this world, or even dimension, and he was merely happy to be wide awake once again. With a renewed sense of vigor and a redound zeal for life, his thoughts once again returned to their earthly pursuits. A bowl of bland porridge and a piece of stale mutton, would be more than greatly appreciated, upon the breakfast table, rooted firmly in place, on this, the familiar and terrestrial ground of his hearth and home."

Carnival King.,"The Carnival King (page 1/2) For all the hype about New Orleans being the city of the  and the carnival floats, all night jazz and its Southern soul, it was still a shitty place to live in if you were not a tourist. Dexter had known this for 18 years, during which time him and his parents (more ghost parents since they were never there) had lived in the Lower 9th. Ward, the poorest and the greyest of all the areas in New Orleans. It was a place of run-down houses, cracked windows, weed choked gardens and broken dreams.His father was a blend of con man and hypochondriac who had worked once in the warehouse district in downtown New Orleans. That had lasted one month after which his father had gone off with a strained back. Thereafter he had claimed invalidity benefit from the State. The thereafter had up to now lasted 15 years. His mother worked part time in a greasy diner (you know the type-the one that looks like a long silver bullet with windows and hard red revolving bum seats.) Ever since Dexter was a kid, his mother always had the smell of burger and onions about her-a smell that survived beyond the daily aerosol of cheap perfumes that she applied.Out of this blight, there was one good thing in Dexters life and that was the girl he had met in High School that year called Sandie. A firefly in the dark, Dexter used to think, pleased with his simple line of poetry. Unlike the other girls he had met in school, he was actually visible to her. Now, Dexter was not remarkable looking having come from two people cast from the plainest mould, into which no colour had been added. Youll never be an oil painting, his mother used to say, and then would mention something about genes. After that, genes were third on his shitty list after New Orleans and his parents. It was strange though, because after three months of seeing Sandie around school, she suddenly left, maybe for another school, who knows. Her disappearance was like a rose garden suddenly made bare, in which there remained only the planting holes like craters on a desolate stretch of soil.It happened that night when Dexter was flicking through the Times Picayune newspaper that he saw the advert in the job section. He was looking for some part time work, since his parents never had money and were never told about pocket money and how it applied to children. Once he looked through his mothers purse and found the saddest thing. The purse smelled of onions and inside it was a 5 cent piece stuck to some chewing gum. He decided then that he must be independent, get some work and move out. This advert though in the paper, was odd. It seemed to strangely stand out, not because it had a fancy box design around it, or fancy lettering but just, somehow did. It was very plain in fact, advertising for a part time warehouse night shift worker in the warehouse district of New Orleans. This area was composed of new modernised yuppie apartments intermingled with some of the oldest warehouses. This one was in Julie Street-Warehouse number 22. Beside the description was a phone number. Dexter decided to ring it, expecting it to ring for ages. In his mind, he pictured a vast dark warehouse and a solitary old fashioned The Carnival King (page 2/2) phone ringing in a dust laden corner. The phone rang once and then was suddenly answered. The voice on the end of the phone was old and I mean, really old. It struggled to speak and replied in a voice that seemed to come from the grave. Hello Dexter, are you enquiring about the job? Dexter felt the blood rising in his head and his first thought was that he has some high-tech device that could trace a person calling. Yes, that was it. The ancient voice continued. Come to the address in the advert tonight at 9pm. I shall be at the door to meet you, and with that, the phone was put down, leaving a shiver running up and down Dexters neck. It might be all right, thought Dexter as he looked at the clock. His parents were as usual not to be seen and he dressed slowly in his dark room, choosing a grey jacket and white shirt he had once used for a funeral. The warehouse area was quite far from where he lived so Dexter left early, taking two buses and walking the rest of the way. The entrance to the warehouse area, was composed of Art galleries and museums, slick restaurants and jazz clubs. He seemed to walk for ages past them all until he reached a darker and unknown part of the warehouse area. This was composed of old warehouses of which many had been shut. One in the middle caught his eye. It had a light falling through a half open door. That must be it, thought Dexter. Immediately he saw a very old man waiting by the door. He greeted Dexter immediately. You are just in time! he said, smiling, Come with me. As he entered the narrow door, the vastness of the interior was inspiring. Wall to wall figures of giant clowns, pierrots and twelve foot high mermaids with garish faces looked down on them. He led Dexter to an ornate float, at the centre of which, stood a golden throne surrounded by kneeling mannequin figures looking up at it. The light from it was blinding and in an instance gone. The old man looked up at the figure of Dexter who was now sitting on the throne, his face a waxen stare and a glimmering crown upon his head. The old man smiled and bowed his head. All hail to the new King of the Carnival. All hail to the King.(1000 words)"
In a nervous party,"Quite a long time ago when I was in school I recall my closest companion called me late night on Saturday to welcome me on her birthday following day. I was glad and exceptionally eager to go there yet I expected to take authorization from my folks. I went to my Papa's room and gradually asked him, ""Father tomorrow is my closest companions birthday and I truly need to go."" Father said, ""Alright I dont mind however ask your mother."" I went to Mom and said, ""Dear Mom"" Unexpectedly she answered, ""What do you need."" I resembled stunned, ""Mother how would you realize that I need to say something."" She said, ""The manner in which you are talking shows that"" and she grinned. I asked her, ""Mother, I need to go tomorrow."" She said, ""Alright you can go yet u must be back before 10."" At that point my arrangements began. I made 1 card for my companion and begin choosing materials for the gathering, lastly everything finished and I rested and only one thing was there to me all the time THE PARTY. I was trusting that the night will end and the gathering to start. Next morning my Mom was shock to see me, no alert, no Mom's admonition just I woke up without help from anyone else. The entire day hosted passed and now its get-together time. My dad dropped me to my companions place and said me that he will be once again at 10. I said, ""alright"" I fled.. I delighted in a ton at party. My companion cherished that card which I made for her and everyone in the gathering adored my dress. I was joyous beyond words. We ate, we played such countless games and it was 10 at long last. I recalled my Mom's recommendation that I ought to be back till 10. I came out and begin looking for my father, yet I was unable to have the option to discover him. I was so stressed and frightened, everyone was inside, I was separated from everyone else there. I sat tight there for 5 to 10 min yet standing by alone is by all accounts more than the time. I began strolling, I thought at any rate I can return home by strolling as my house was 20 min away from my companions place. As I was strolling I was sobbing as I have never strolled alone out and about that too around evening time. Out of nowhere I heard somebody calling something. I was frightened and I began strolling quick. I thought some hooligan was there or some phantom As I was strolling quick I heard somebody strolling quick behind me. I began running and crying, at that point I saw a few vehicles left there. I took cover behind those vehicles. I saw one shadow looking for me. I petitioned god to save me and to assist me with arriving at home. After at some point I was unable to see that shadow. I came out gradually and ran towards my home. At last I arrived at home. I embraced my mother and I began crying. She began posing such countless inquiries what happened,why you are crying and everything except I couldn't answer any of them. After at some point I loose and said everything to mother. She got terrified and keeping in mind that we were talking about my dad came and asked what occurred. When I began disclosing to him my story he said, ""I saw you and I was shouting at you however you were fleeing from me and unexpectedly you vanished. I was looking through you there. I arrived behind schedule there as my tire got cut."" My mother blasted out chuckling and told my father everything, I was stunned to hear that and felt assuaged. My dad embraced me and said, ""You ought to have stand by there."" My mother said, ""You ought to be quiet and solid in each circumstance."" Yet, they said they are truly cheerful and pleased with me that I returned home. That day I laid down with my folks and truly had a sense of security and secure. Following day I went to class I told my companions all that occurred with me the previous evening they heard everything and were shock that I courageously face everything.. So that was the best party and brave evening and incredible reaction from everybody I adored thatI was walking in the park when I saw her. It was drizzling, and she was sitting on the swing, facing the calm lake that only ever seems to be interrupted by raindrops, umbrella in hand, pushing her feet back and forth ever so slowly. I cautiously approached her, wondering why she is here at a time so late. Everyone calls her an oddball, someone who cannot think straight. The thought of puddles on the ground slipped my mind, and she suddenly spoke, not turning around, voice being so elegant and careful.Why ever are you out here? Alas, have you come to listen to the crickets too?What? I say, taken aback.She pauses as if collecting her thoughts. Or perhaps you are lonely or alone, seeking company?This is one of the things that makes her so different from everyone else, her speech, or rather, way of communicating. And how she pronounced each word delicately. Too proper. Why would I want to socialize at a time so late? I retort, mildly angry at her peacefulness.Alas, you could only be out here at this time for the crickets. However, it is not in my place to know.Why would I be out here for stupid crickets?They are not stupid. Cant you hear their ever so wonderful music? I focus my attention on the chirping of the crickets. It is like music, always having a rhythm.Guess I never thought about it before,You havent? She says in shock, finally turning her head around to meet my eyes. I smile. Her hair bounces against her shoulders in the process, as if being abruptly taken out of their calm trance. Her eyes, pools of chamomile tea. I shake my head no.Why, they sing the most beautiful songs,-she turns back around- I could listen all day, She giggles, putting her hand to her mouth.Whats so funny?Oh, I just had quite a thought. If I were to listen to them sing all day long, I probably would not get anything done. It would rather be a waste of time, dont you think?I wouldnt think it would be a waste of time! I say, and she visibly jumps."
Now We Want To Learn,"See those clouds, it will rain soon, said Thiago. People sitting in front of him made bewildered faces. A man named Bennett stood up and asked, Why will it rain? Thiago smiled and said, Because I said so!Perhaps, you have come to know how Thiago was taking advantage of the stupid people of his village. Everyone living in this village didnt know anything about the basic knowledge of life and clever Thiago, always took benefit of this by making their mind accept that he was a genius who somehow made his words true. After working hard for three years he was successfully able to prove himself the most knowledgeable person in the village. One more weird thing in that village was that, the peopl living there were okay with the fact that they were uneducated. They were exactly like those tribals who didnt want to learn something new, and wanted to live same as always. Having one guider was enough for them, they thought. When Thiago was a small child, he was told by someone that if hell work hard, hell become very powerful and everyone will respect him. Maybe they forgot to tell him that, Dont work hard until you are sure that you are doing it in right path.Everyday in the morning, everyone used to gather in the shade of a tree for taking class from Thiago who earned a lot of money and respect from this. Hey, if Ill ask you to eat your favorite dish as much as you can. Then how many plates of that dish will you eat? asked Thiago, to a small child. Then the child answered, I will eat hundreds of plates of that dish. Ok, I offer you fifty plates today and the remaining fifty plates tomorrow, and I take guarantee that you wont be able to eat more than two plates! Crowd started burbling. Child took the first plate, and started eating in front of everybody. He took at least 15 minutes to eat that plate and then took second plate. When the half of the plate remained, he felt that he couldnt take even one more bite from his favorite dish! Everyone was shocked seeing it. They werent aware of this situation as they never ate more than one plate. Thiago was giggling all the time. Bennett stood up and asked, How did that happen? Thiago gave his usual answer, Because I said so!One day a man named Richard, who lived somewhere else, came to know about the situation of the village. He was apprehensive about it,therefore he decided to go to that village and talk to Thiago. Next week, he reached there and saw everybody doing pinheaded and illogical works which was not at all useful for their lives.This made Richard very angry and now he was eagerly looking for him. He saw Thiago sitting below a tree, dressed like an experienced saint. His attitude told Richard that Thiago thought himself as a god of the village. Richard strided towards him, and fumed by saying, Hello Mr. Thiago, I want to have a very serious and solemn discussion with you. Thiago said, Sit down or else in another 5 minutes your leg will start aching. I guarantee so. Richard giggled, and asked Why? Thiago again said, Because I am saying so! Now Richard stopped smiling and yelled at him, No! My leg wont ache because you are saying so, it will ache because of scientific reasons! Stop giving false knowledge to me and everyone in this village! His loud voice made everyone gather over there. Thiago was thunderstruck after seeing someone with real knowledge standing in front of him, who would reveal everything if he wont stop him. He said, Everyone, did you see him insulting me? Hes insulting your leader! Who taught you everything! Just remove this person from front of my eyes! All of the people gathered around Richard and when they came a bit close to him, he suddenly laughed.  Ok, lets see if this person, who think himself as your leader is really worth it or not, Richard said. He pointed towards uncle Bennett and asked, Ask me something that you had once asked Thiago, to which he gave the reason because I said so.. and Ill prove it to you. After thinking very hard, Bennett slowly asked him, We once asked him that why it was going to rain to which he answered Richard stopped him. The reason behind this is that the clouds you see up there are made up of water droplets. Within a cloud, water droplets condense onto one another, causing the droplets to grow. When these water droplets get too heavy to stay suspended in the cloud, they fall to Earth as rain. That's the true reason. It wasnt raining because he said so! And you all believed him? Thiago interrupted, Wait, dont listen to him, he is telling lie dont believe him. Things really happen because I say so! People were silent and confused. Richard continued, See, I have not come here to spread hatred. All I want to prove is that you must understand the reason behind the existence of anything, nothing happens just by what someone says. People become knowledgeable by getting education. And only a knowledgeable person can share knowledge! And a knowledgeable person always tries to make everyone knowledgeable. Think hard, and answer me! Do you think that he is doing so? Is he trying to make you all intelligent? This time Thiago was also silently listening. He didnt know why, but he thought that Richard was right...He felt guilty for what he had done with these people. Before anyone could answer Richards question, he came forward and asked everyone for mercy. Now everyone was understanding the situation. They also felt guilty for their attitude, that they would never try to learn something new. They understood, that if someone will work hard in right path, he can be his own leader! Why to depend on anybody else when you are capable?"
Lemon,"When we arrived at the theme park, I could not believe my eyes. I had never seen such a place before, nor could I have imagined one like it. It did not even come close to the image I get when mom reads my favorite book about a perfect place called paradise. The excitement bubbled up inside of me and it busted out once we were finally inside. I started running around, screaming, singing like a kid, not caring about the strangers who all turned around to look at me. My sister Rose looked at me annoyed, rolling her eyes, almost looking embarrassed and my mother was trying to calm me down. I understand why youre so happy. She smiled and put a hand on me in an attempt to make me sit still. This place is amazing. But you have to be aware of other people too. Only this day I didnt care about other people. It was my day. I looked around again, and I didnt even know where I should point my eyes to. There was so much happening, it was overwhelming to me. Dad seemed to notice my over-stimulation and he cleverly conjured up a map out of his pocket to show me the options. My eyes were immediately drawn to the big dragon situated on the left side of the map. This one! After checking if I was allowed to go into this one, since Im not very tall (only 5 feet), we got on our way to the monstrous looking dragon which you could easily already see from afar. We walked past some other attractions like a water slide, a big boat that moved up and down, a roller coaster in a castle and the final one before the dragon had something to do with fruits but you couldnt really see what it did since most of it happened underground. Anyway, from closer, the dragon looked even more intimidating and I was excited to go into his mouth and to be spit out of it, since that is how the attraction went. After waiting in the line what felt like eternity we got in the car and the adrenaline went through me, making me feel like I was actually flying. It was spectacular. Suddenly the car stopped and everything went dark. At first I thought it was part of the attraction but then an alarm went off and the car fell down for a long time. It was almost like I was in an elevator going down but way too fast. My stomach kicked into my lungs and when the car reached the ground I noticed I had held my breath all along the fall. I moved my arms to the places where my I thought my parents and sister sat, not capable of speaking yet, but I only could only reach the air. I started crying out of fear and frustration. So many questions started running through my mind. Once I came to terms a little bit I tried yelling Help a few times, but I could only hear my own echo back. I must have been in a very large hall, one thats situated underneath the dragon. Or maybe I fell into the dragon itself. I carefully stepped out of my car, and I found moms bag still in it to my relief. I searched for her phone and tried to call my father but there was no signal. I turned on the flashlight and I could see many abandoned cars spread in this room. There was one lemon asking my attention, and I thought that one mustve been part of the fruit roller coaster. Suddenly I noticed some movement in the lemon car, and two eyes, lightened by the phone I was holding, were staring at me. I froze in fear, too scared to move. H-hello? Instead of hearing a voice back, I heard some high-pitched barking and I dropped the bag I was still holding to come closer to the lemon. I had never really showed interest in dogs, in fact it was rather my sister who had always loved animals, but I weirdly felt an attraction to this being. I sat in the lemon car, and I started petting the dog. His wet tongue gently touched the skin of my arm and I started giggling. A loud bang let me come back in reality. We both got up at the same time and the dog seemed to know the way instinctively so I started following him. Suddenly he stopped and Im happy he did, because otherwise I wouldve bumped into a wall. His nose pointed against a door, and I tried to turn the handle but the door was closed. I tried to use more force. Nothing happened. I sighed, and put my hair in a ponytail. It was either getting hot in here, or it was because of my effort. Then I knew it.  I am such a fan of crime and action movies, it shouldve come naturally to me. I took out my hair pin and stuffed it in the key lock. It took me a few tries of turning it before the door finally made some movement and the light coming from behind blinded me. Once my eyes got adjusted, I found myself back in the middle of the amusement park. The only difference to what felt like a couple of hours ago was that my family was nowhere to be seen and I got a dog with me. I couldnt believe how, not so long ago, I used to be so excited by this place, but now I couldnt wait to leave. All the people around me and all the different attractions, roller-coasters and playground equipment were still overwhelming to me, but now more in a negative way. I seemed to have lost my mothers phone, so I made my way through the crowd, to try to find my parents this way. I looked back to make sure the dog was following me, when I heard my mother calling my name. Mom!, I say and I cry tears of joy. Only, when I saw her, our surroundings were not the same anymore. Instead of all the different colors and music I saw the calming color of green, the one that the walls of my room are painted with. I blinked a few times to see if I was not actually dreaming but then I understood that the park was actually a dream I just woke up from. The dragon, the short circuit, the dog, it all was part of my imagination. I focused again on the face of my mother in real life, who looked a bit confused by my tears. You had a weird dream, huh? I nodded. Well, you should come back to reality. Today is the big day. Are you ready to go? Now it was up to me to be confused. To go where? How could you forget? Were going to that theme park youve always wanted to go to. A gift from us for your birthday that is tomorrow, remember? Her smile uncovered her perfectly aligned teeth and it reminded me of her smile at the beginning of my dream.  I looked away.  I used to be so excited for this. Now my dream gift has changed. I looked back into my mothers eyes. This was the first time I noticed how beautiful they actually were. My definition of paradise was definitely different from the one I had not so long ago. Mom, I changed my mind.  I dont need to go to a theme park anymore. If its okay with you and dad, I want a dog and I will name him Lemon."
Victor VanLorn's Lunar Circus,"Victor VanLorns Lunar Circus was known for taking its customers away. Natalie didnt think it would be quite so literal.The circus was a collection of blue and grey tents with strings of lights that looked like mason jars filled with fireflies. Natalie had been so enamored with it all: the joyous cries of laughing children, the smell of funnel cake and popcorn, and the sparkling wonder of the circus that made Natalie wander around so bravely. Shed drifted through the carnival games, followed behind a trio of performing acrobats, and looked deep into the eyes of a caged tigress. The only problem was that shed lost her way back to her parents and when the darker it got, the less Natalie wanted to stay. Trying to find her way, Natalie walked through the circus. The tents here werent the glorious big top or the charming carnival games. Behind the scenes, a circus started to lose its whimsy. The roars of sleepy lions started to sound like they were hugging her in the dark and the people talking seemed sinister and feral. Biting back the urge to cry, Natalie tried retracing her footsteps until she stumbled across a group of performers sitting around a fire.Eighty-six, a young woman frowned, flipping through a stack of bills, eighty-seven, eighty-eightdamn it. Coming up short, again.Victor isnt willing to front you anymore? Another woman asked.Im still trying to pay off my last advance, the young woman sighed. She was wearing a gold leotard that sparkled against the firelight. Her black hair was pulled back into a sleek ponytail adorned with golden pins. On her back were a pair of fairy wings with more firelight sparkles that Natalie couldnt help but stare at. The other woman had blonde hair and was dressed in an outfit that looked like a bluebird warming itself by an open flame. A bald man with a pair of black pants and a fourth person wearing a dark blue mask with spiky black hair were sitting around the fire as well, the bluebird womans head in the bald mans lap as they lounged.Downside of circus life, the bald man grumbled, running his fingers down the bluebird womans arm, no overtime pay.I dont see why you pay rent anywhere, the blue masked person shrugged, folding their arms behind their head.Its a storage unit. I want to have somewhere to go after I finish my time here and itd be easier if I was starting with more than what I have in my car.What about temp work? Bluebird asked. John made some extra money when we were stuck in Atlanta for a week between shows.Worst five days of my life, the bald man sighed. Corporate doesnt care for clowns! as the owner always told me. Not that I was any worse than of the other goons in the data entry crew. The three I was with were always high off theirShh! The golden woman perked up and looked across the fire. Whats she doing here?Everyone around the fire looked, surprised to see Natalie, but their surprise was quickly covered over by careful ease. The Bluebird perked up and hopped over the fire, crouching in front of Natalie with an eager smile. Hello, little girlwhat are you doing back here?I Natalie stammered, her voice breaking a little. I cant find my mom and dadPoor girls freezing, the Blue Mask said. Come sit by the fire for a minute. Youre shivering so much I can see from here.Natalie hesitated, but the warm smile of the Bluebird and the Golden Woman enticed her to sit. Bluebird made a show of clearing off a stool for Natalie, wiping it clean with a handkerchief. Bald John hoisted her up and plopped her onto the stool.There we are, John beamed, best seat in the house! A warm fire and good company are the keys to a good mood! Whats your name, miss?Natalie. I live in town.Well, Natalie who lives in Town, Blue Mask smiled, my friends call me Rain! This is John and his lovely wife, Hannah. And our lady in gold, Amy. Were all quite pleased to meet!Are you all in the circus?Acrobats, Hannah said. Except for John, but hes alright for a clown.Theyre all well enough, Amy said. Did you come with your parents, Natalie?Natalie nodded and regarded the stack of bills in Amys grasp. I have two dollarsOh? Amy asked a little confused.You can have it, Natalie said, stretching out her hand with the crumpled bills in it.Oh, I couldnt take it from you, Amy smiled. Its sweet of you to offer, butMy mom said I could spend my circus money how I want, Natalie said. I dont mind.Amy sighed deeply and looked to her other compatriots. When no one else objected, Amy took the two bills from her grasp. Well, Id hate to take something for nothing. Two dollars strikes me as enough for a small parade.Natalie the Generous! John said, hoisting Natalie onto his shoulders. The Charitablethe Kind!Well sing her praises through the Lunar Lane! Rain cheered, hopping up and running in circles around John.Natalie giggled as the acrobats rushed through the circus, cheering for her and jumping into throngs of people. People applauded as she walked by and John encouraged her to wave at people as they passed by. Before long nearly, the entire circus was following Natalie and her crew as they marched through the impromptu streets.Natalie! Natalies mother came rushing through the crowd and reached up for her. Amy lifted her from the bald mans shoulders and passed her off to her mother with a smile.The golden acrobat knelt down and smiled. ""A good deed can be its own reward, but you helped me more than you may ever know."" Amy stood again a little prouder and raised her hands to the crowd. To Lady Natalie the Charitable! Amy cheered. ""Friend to the circus and all the circus folk!""The crowd roared with applause as Natalies mother carried her out of the circus and the acrobats cheered. Natalie looked back to see Amy holding up the two dollars with a broad grin."
happiness turned to sorrow,"I was admitted to Colonel Sher Khan's cadet College in Swabi. The atmosphere there was very calm. I met many friends there but one of these friends was named Junaidullah Khan. Junaidullah Khan had a very good character and good looks. He always loved me.Doing and supporting me in a very good way and always taking care of me and that's why he became my close friend until our friendship was now famous all over the college.

The  beautiful girl like her I have never seen in my life that I will tell her about it. At last the time was near.Junaidullah Khan asked me for his picture. I was also very worried that if I tell you the picture of this girl, that girl is beautiful in my eyes, but if I tell you the picture of this girl, that girl may be  not so beautiful in Junaid point of veiw.And if his family's expectations were not met,  then what would I do? I knew another one who actually showed my friend Junaidullah Khan a picture of her. He gave that picture to his parents.Show to parents. Parents also agreed. Junaid also agreed and now I was in trouble. So why did I show the wrong picture? I showed the picture wrong because I wanted to make their expectations. .I Junaid also liked that girl and his parents also liked her. their parents make a plan  to visit her house and told me that Now we will go to their house. You will want to be with us and we will have an engagement ceremony soon Now the engagement program was being talked about here and on the other hand I was suffering from mental stress so that if would not like any girl and the friendship between us would not deteriorate.

The tidiness,"Quite a while past, soon after he made the world, God chose to take a vacation day. As every one of the creatures were recently made and didn't have a clue what they ought to do, God couldn't leave them all alone so he went looking for a heavenly messenger to care for them. Despite the fact that he was somewhat pointless, Perico the darling so needed to be with the creatures and argued such a great amount to be permitted to deal with them that God gave him the work. 'Ensure they rest before dull and are alert before first light. We can't leave the Earth unfilled!' was the solitary guidance God gave him. Loaded up with energy, Perico went sensible and went through the day playing with the creatures. He was glad to such an extent that it was almost evening when he recollected that he expected to send the creatures to bed. 'Please everybody, rapidly! Off to rest.' 'Where do we leave the entirety of our parts?' asked the creatures. They hadn't had them for long and weren't accustomed to laying down with their ears, bills, hooks, noses and feet, which they took off to head to sleep. 'I'm not very sure: simply leave them there in a heap. Please fast, time's slipping away', Perico answered fretfully. Not long before the last beam of sun vanished, every one of the creatures were sleeping. 'Goodness, that was close. I pulled off it' thought the darling. And afterward, extremely drained, he hit the hay. He woke up not long before first light and rushed to wake the creatures. 'Please! Get up! You need to put every one of your parts on and be conscious before sunrise'.Once upon a time, a boy moved houses. On entering his new bedroom he saw that it was full of toys, storybooks, pens, pencils....That day he played all he liked, but went to bed without having tidied up.Mysteriously, the next morning all the toys had been put back in their proper place. He was sure that no one had entered his bedroom,. The exact same thing happened that day, and the next, but when the fourth day arrived and he went to get his first toy of the day,, ""I don't want to play with you!""The boy thought he was seeing things, but the same happened with every toy he touched. Finally, an old teddy bear said to him: ""Why are you surprised that we don't want to play with you? You always leave us so far from our proper place,. Do you have any idea how difficult it is for the books to climb back up onto their shelves, or for the pens to jump into their tin? You haven't a clue how uncomfortable and cold the floor is! We won't play with you any more until you promise to leave us in our little houses before you go off to bed., and how bad he felt when he had once slept in a chair. He realised how badly he had treated his friends, the toys. He asked their forgiveness, and from that day he always put his toys nicely in their special places before he got into bed.Oh, Great Wizard! A great tragedy has occurred! Little Manu has stolen the magic potion with the Word Thrower spell.Manu? But thats the bad-mannered child who insults everyone! How awful. We have to stop him before he drinks it!But it was already too late.. It was as if these were ghosts that, when hurled at people, passed straight through them and turned them into whatever Manu had said.Manu, stop doing that! Youre hurting everybody. Quick, please drink this othI dont want to! This is too much fun! And I am the only one who has the power to do it. Ha, ha, ha, ha! Idiots! Stupid! Baldy! Oldie! He launched into a tirade of insults.I have an idea, master,. We could give the potion to everyone.Are you crazy? That would be a terrible idea. If this is the result of just one child hurling insults, imagine what it would be like if everyone did it! I have to think of something., Manu took charge of the city. Everyone served and obeyed him out of fear. Luckily, the wizard was able to use his magic to reach Manu during the night and give him a few drops of the new potion while he was sleeping. Manu woke up ready to have fun at the expense of others., carrying his breakfast, hundreds of letters flew towards Manu, forming many words, among which he could only make out bully,. On coming into contact with his skin, the letters dissolved, stinging him very badly.The boy shouted,, but soon realised that the butler had seen nothing.Nor had anyone from whom further bursts of horrible letters were uttered in his direction. In one single day,.But as much as he cried and asked for forgiveness, it was too late for the antidote.You will have to learn to live with both spells: word throwing and thought receiving. Used correctly,. He had behaved so badly towards everyone that, even if they were too afraid to tell him to his face, they thought horrible things of him,. He started to stay in alone all the time.One day, a little girl saw his sad face and felt sorry for him. She thought she might like to be friends with him and when this thought touched Manus skin, instead of pain he felt something lovely. Manu had an idea.What if I were to use the Word Thrower spell with good words? Would it work the other way round? Manu wondered.. And, sure enough, his words flew towards her,. The girl didnt say anything, but her appreciative thoughts made Manu feel the best he had ever felt.xcited,. In the process, he managed to change peoples bad opinions of him and he soon realised that he could have done this from the outset. If he had been kind and polite,.The effect of the potions eventually disappeared but Manu didnt go back to his old ways. He had learnt that it was much better to feel everyones affection and friendship"
Night of the Demons,"From the kitchen window, Breanne watched her seven sister snow hares decorate the Shiring Tree.They hung long streamers of gold and silver tinsel about the smooth white branches.Pippas seven brothers had hung ropes of twinkling white lights earlier that day. Bree was having a hard time with this years pie.This year she had to win the trophy, it would be Grannybunnys last Shiring Festival.Scowling, she pictured last years trophy sitting in the window of Pippas house, on the eastside, for all the snow rabbit community to see.She could not fail again this year.	She was using Grannybunnys recipe, from a handwritten cookbook that would eventually be passed down to her, she did most of the cooking in the burrow.The pie filling was missing something, somethingsomething. She tapped a finger against her chin.She had read the entire cookbook from cover to back, seeking enlightenment, some special ingredient mentioned between the lines perhaps.	Breannes snowy sisters came bounding in the door, chittering away happily and shaking iridescent flakes from their long ears. They talked of what they were going to wear that night and who they would dance with.Bree did not care about any of that silly girl stuff, she only cared about beating that pompous rabbit from the east side of the tree.	As the night chased the last of the light from the day, the proud Shiring Tree looked more radiant than ever.The thousands of heart shaped leaves, red like drops of blood, whispered softly, announcing the coming of winter. Winter was their favorite season.The bears were hibernating, the hares downy soft fur turned white, and thin-skinned humans rarely ventured this far north. The ancient tree was so enormous, its branches canopied the entire meadow.The twinkling lights, like bright happy stars, lit the clearing entirely, as hares from all four burrows laid out tablecloths and a polished pine dancefloor.The yearly Shiring Festival invoked the most romantic feelings in even the most curmudgeonly of rabbits.Brees sisters wished she would loosen up a bit, have some fun, meet a nice boyShe could only think of the trophy and her pie.	Davy will ask me to dance tonight, said Petunia, Ive caught him staring a couple of times	Oh Petty, of course he will!Youre the prettiest bunny in Shiretown.Said Ivy giggling.	Poppy rolled her eyes.The eight were identical octuplets.	Im going to wear my red dress, to match the Shiring Tree leaves. Said Annette, dancing with her dress, twirling on her toes.	Thats sure to make Bobby notice you, said Pony, Ive got my eye on his brother Paul, hes got really big feet.	All the chattering and gossip was driving Breanne mad.She couldnt concentrate on her pie.She grabbed her coat from its hook and went out the backdoor unnoticed. She walked to the center of the meadow and looked up at the magnificent tree, the lights made the snow sparkle like diamond powder.She inhaled the icy winter air, and it cleared her head.She breathed in the wonderful seasonal scents: pine needles, sap, smoke from her neighbors cookfires and ginger snap cookies.She leaned against the trunk of the tree, the rippled white bark cool as verglas against her cheek.The bark smelled a bit like cinnamon.A bit like nutmeg too, maybe spicier.An idea came to her like jolt of lightning.	Bree raced back home, then came back to the tree with a sharp little paring knife.She looked around, making sure no one was watching, then she stripped a sliver of bark away from the back of the tree.A droplet of crimson sap oozed from the wound.A goose walked over her grave.She put the bark in her pocket then piled a bit of the snow to the trunk to hide the red hole she had made.	Back at home, her silly sisters were in the bedroom at the far end of the burrow, still chattering away about boy bunnies and clothes and shoes.  They put on mascara.	Bree took the bark from her pocket and dried it the oven.Then she placed it in her mortar and pestled it into a fine aromatic powder.Two teaspoons went into her pie filling.She baked the pie until the flakey crust was a perfect golden brown, crunchy sugar grains in the crumbles glittered on top.	Breanne quickly got into her best dress, a silk cobalt blue with delicate crystal beads along the throat and sleeves.Poppy, who was not interested in boys, and Grannybunny waited for her downstairs. The rest of her sisters had left a half hour before.	The band started playing at eight. Some snow hares were already dancing, many were admiring the buffet table laden with steaming dishes, sparkling cutlery, and a crystal punch bowl with rubarb-apple cider in it the color of a young girls blush. Pippa was standing by the table with the pies on it, its center held the trophy.Breanne couldnt help but notice he was quite dashing in a charcoal grey suit and cherry red bowtie. she reminded herself, Im	She placed her pie next to his, brushing her hand against his.An electric tingle went through her chest.Odd.	Hi Bree.You look ravishing tonight. Said Pippa.	Pippa. She nodded slightly at the charming rabbit, taken by surprise by his candor.I like your tie.And she thought to herself. Aloud she said, Good luck with the contest.	Same to you my dear.	Breanne turned away and went to her giggling sisters.	Pippa likes you!cried Shireen.	Hes the enemy, hes just sizing up the competition.Said Bree, annoyed.Besides, I could never date an eastsider.	Pony piped up, Whatever you say big sis.But to try relax and have some fun.Go have a drink.Go dance, the band is smokin hot this year!Oh!Theres Paul.Seeya. She hopped happily off to a boyishly cute rabbit in a salmon pink sports coat.	The band played a classic ELO tune, but Bree didnt feel like dancing.She spied Pippa talking to a small pretty bunny from the south burrow, her fur not completely white yet.Hmph.	At eleven oclock the pies were cut.Every rabbit in the community sampled a bite from every pie.Pippas peach walnut pie got 39 votesand Brees loganberry pie with a crumble topping 43.Shed won!Bree hugged the golden trophy to her chest and beamed.It was shaped like a tapered cup with rabbit heads for the two handles.Etched into shiny the surface, a piece of pie and the date.The blank spot above the date would have her name on it tomorrow!	Grannybunny said, Thats my girl!Westsiders rule!	The westside burrows danced and mingled with every burrow except the eastside.The eastside burrows with all but the westside.	At midnight the party wound down, the last of the punch was drunk and the last of the carrot sticks eaten.Bree gathered up her sisters and noticed they looked odd.Ponys fur was turning red before her eyes!Shireens eyes were three times their size and black as coal, making her face like a skull!She looked around and saw that ALL the rabbits were morphing intothey looked like gargoyles!Their tails stretched long and whip-like with spearhead tips, their ears hairless and rubbery like melting candles.They were all red as if skinned alive!Their mouths filled up with so many shark-like teeth they couldnt close them.Their arms stretched to the ground, their swollen knuckles dragged in the snow, the fingertips ending in long black talons.The rabbits' swollen heads sprouted dark curled horns.They were devils!Hideous sulfurous demons!	Wheres Granny!? cried Shireen.	Im here dear. Replied a demon with wrinkly crimson skin and small round spectacles.	Another old creature came to the westside from the east.Hello Maybel	Hello Sharon. Replied Brees grandmother, her voice frigid with hatred.	I heard stories about the Shiring Tree Curse from my own grandmother when I was just a toddler. Said Maybel. I always thought it was just a bedtime story, one to frighten little children.	As did I. said Sharon, the eastside granny. This was the doing of you foolish westsiders!	I think not! Maybel screeched back, her wrinkly red fists balled up and ready for action.Only eastsiders could be so stupid!	The northsiders and the southsiders stood around them, shaking their heads, unwilling to take sides.	The two old rivals came at each other with claws outstretched.	Wait!I did it!I violated the Shiring Tree! screamed Breanne.Please stop fighting!All the rabbits in the clearing froze in stunned silence, their jaws dropped open like attic trapdoors.Im so sorry!I didnt know.I only took a tiny bit of bark.	Sharon said, I told you it had to be a westsider! The punishment for violating the tree is death!	A heavy moan spread through the crowd like a fetid breeze.	I did too! announced Pippa.He came to Bree and took her hand defiantly, daring anyone to lay a finger on her. 	Bree was grateful and squeezed his hand in a viselike grip. You put it in your pie too? she asked.	Yes, but you still won.	I dont care about winning anymore.Ive turned us all to demons! she said forlornly.	WE did, you mean. Said Pippa.	Bree turned to the northside granny who was the oldest and wisest of all the rabbits, do we have to have our heads chopped off?Is there no other way?	The northern demon-hare said, Technically, the old rule that protects the tree indicates a blood sacrifice, not necessarily death.	Blood sacrifice? asked Pippa.	Yes.Your blood must soak into the laceration you made, to make up for the sap the tree bled.Then you both must spend the night in the tree.It will decide to either forgive or condemn.	Pippa asked shakily, What if it condemns us?	Then we will have to behead you and live forever in the shadows as horrid demons.	Well, lets get this over with. Pippa said.He walked towards the Shiring tree, still holding Brees hand.The tree was not a joyous festive protector anymore.It was now an angry vengeful giant towering over them with simmering contempt in its heart.The crowd parted to let the couple through, then followed.Silks and satins rustling gently were the only sounds.	Pippa and Breanne reached the tree.Pony raced over with a small paring knife shed run home to fetch, it was the same one from earlier that evening.Fitting.She gave it to Bree.Pippa bent to the trunk and brushed away the snow revealing two small holes in the bark.The demon crowd gasped as one.	I made this one, he said, pointing to the bloody little hole to the left of the other.	Bree only nodded and turned her creepy red hand palm up.She sliced deep enough to have blood well up, but not so deep to need stitches.A sharp cry escaped her clenched fangs.She ran the knife over Pippas upturned demon hand, he bravely gritted his teeth.Simultaneously, the couple bent forward and pressed their palms to the trees wounds.After ten seconds, they stood and watched as their blood was sucked into the wood like rich red wine down a drain.		The demon-hares left, their long red tails whipped to and fro like angry cobras behind them. Breanne and Pippa climbed up the tree.  Brees sisters sobbed all the way home.Pippas brother Ralph brought them a thick woolen blanket.Maybel and Sharon were the last to leave.There was nothing left to do.		Up in the center of the tree the young couple curled up in a wide fork.Between the heavy blanket and their own body heat, they were quite toasty warm.		Why do our familys hate each other? asked Pippa.	Bree said, I dont know.All I know is that Grannybunny gets all huffed up when you even mention your Grammas name.I think the feud must have started with those two a long time ago.	Yeah, Gramma gets all snippy too, when you mention the name Maybel in our house.	Maybe they competed in a pie contest.	The demons burst out laughing.	I dont think Ill be able to sleep. Bree said.	Pippa said, Me neither.Every time I close my eyes, I see a big scary grizzly bear wearing a leather hood and sharpening an ax.	Bree shivered, Thanks a lot.Your death vision is worse than mine.I see a guillotine.The blade is slick with blood and drops are falling into a stained wicker basket.	What?!Thats way creepier than my bear!	Lets try and think of something pleasant. Said Breanne.Im sorry I didnt dance tonight.The band was good.They even played my favorite ELO song.Its been stuck in my head since I heard it.Then she started singing, 	Pippa joined in on the  part.Then they sang the rest together, 	After singing the entire song, they talked.	Will you be my girl? asked Pippa.	Yes. Sighed Bree.She kissed him then asked, What will our grandmothers say?	It may get ugly.But they need to get over this feud of theirs. Pipped said.	Bree said, Yes!Whatever it is, they are going to talk it out.Even if we have to lock them in a room together!	They chuckled at the mental image.	They talked until faint indigo tickled the sky and the stars marched off to bed.When the sky lightened to lavender, the demons dozed off.They awoke to the shouts of their families, friends and neighbors.Everyone was running towards the great tree.They were snowy white hares again!Pippa and Breanne looked at each other and saw a soft furry white face looking back.	We keep our heads! Bree exclaimed.	Pippa added, Whoo-hoo!	The hares all whooped and laughed around the couple.After a while everyone went home to their breakfasts.	Grannybunny said, Come inside Breanne, Ill make us some French toast.	You go on ahead, Ill be in in a minute. She replied.	When they were alone again Pippa held out his arms to Bree.She didnt hesitate.She fell into his arms and he gently rocked with her to music only they could hear."
It's a Jungle,"Here we are, the bus took us right into the fairground, Celeste held her gaze out the window, her adrenalin rising up in excitement. They, (her best friend Julian had this trip planned for awhile and saved every penny) to go to the largest fair, a five hour bus ride away, and spend the night at her aunt Kathy's. ""Oh look, the ferris wheel!! Isnt it so pretty, all the lights lit up!"" She squealed, still facing the window while Julian was texting. Julian was the more serious one of the two, less reluctant to go on this journey than she was. But finally with strong persuasion, Celeste managed to convince her. Summer was coming to an end, and soon they would be off to college, studying and making new friends in different cities. Celeste wanted a memory for them to have, and the fair was perfect, her father drove them to the bus station, made sure they got on safely with the other kids going. It was a rowdy ride. ""Come on, let's get some cotton candy first."" She swung her arm into her friends, people hustling everywhere, the smells of food dredging into their senses. It was going to be a wild day.""Oh, sweet, the mirror house, let's do it."" Julian took an interest. Together they wove in and out of the mirrors, making funny faces and giggling. Outside the clowns were doing their show on a large mat, a bucket for coins on the ground.""I hate clowns."" Julian grumbled, and walked over to the edge waiting impatiently for Celeste, who finally came to join her again.""Want to go into the haunted house? Or how about a ride on the ferris wheel first?"" She asked Julian, who pulled her long auburn hair back, tying it. It was hot, muggy, the air thick with scents of all sorts. Even a lingering animal smell from the barn. Horses were being brought in for the show later that evening. It was a typical fair, hustling and bustling with loud music from the rides, vendors shouting for games to be played. ""Two tickets please."" Celese gave the ferris wheel vendor her money, and they were boarded onto the seats and locked into place. Up they went, and could see the entire fairground from where they sat at the top, high up like into the clouds they were, she thought happily, almost dizzy actually. ""I have to pee."" Julian grumbled. And they went to the washrooms, which, of course were lined up. She had to wait. Celeste wanted to see the souvenirs. ""I will be right back in a jiff."" She informed Julian, who was tapping her foot and arms crossed. Celeste ignored her body language. She walked along the aisles of treasures, savoring every second. It didnt seem like she had gone very far, but then, she was at the back exit of the building. It was larger than she anticipated. She then got aggresively shoved out by some boys, and decided to get a few drinks. ****Dusk was settling now, she and Julian would have to call aunty to get picked up for the night. She suddenly had no idea where she was. Her heart started to beat faster. The crowds seemed to get bigger, 'OK, don't panic, take a breath', she told herself, and tried to make it back to the public building where she had left Julian. Circles, she was walking in circles. Damm it, where the hell is she? Tired, hot and hungry now, she tried to ask people where the building was with no luck. She just got ignored. The darkness was coming fast but the fair grounds were well lit. Celeste stood for a minute beside a vendor to get her bearings. She got a corn dog hungrily, and a pop. ""Hey, can you tell me where the public building is? I am kinda lost and have to find my friend."" She asked a vendor, who begrudingly pointed the direction to her. ""Thanks."" She said and popped some change in his tip jar. She walked once again, through the crowds and the noise. She felt light headed and wanted to get out of there now. Maybe this was not such a good idea after all. She was lost. Finally, she saw her friend, walking with a police woman. ""OMG, there she is. Celeste, where have you been, I was so worried."" Julian screeched. ""I..I'm sorry, I got lost and confused. It's so crowded here and noisy."" Celeste hugged her. She was so happy to be back with Julian. ""And where is your cell phone?"" Julian scolded.""I put it in your purse, I had too much stuff in mine, I didnt think this would happen."" Celeste was almost in tears.""Ok, ladies, I am glad this ended well. Can I call anyone for you?"" The bored police woman asked. Celeste gave her aunt's number and the pick up was arranged at the front gates.""Boy, I would love nothing more than a hot bath and a warm bed."" Celeste breathed, as they sat in the back of the van.""Getting lost at a fair that large is scary, it's a good thing nothing terrible happened young ladies."" Her aunt scolded. She was worried when the police woman called her at the start.""I know, thank God we found each other."" She said tiredly, her eyes already starting to drift off as they got back to the house.Julian was thinking of those clowns, shuddering at the site of one of them boring his painted eyes at her. It gave her the creeps. Like in of those Steven King novels.""I hate clowns"", she muttered.""What?"" Celeste was almost asleep, it was after 11 pm now, the hot bath would have to wait.""Clowns, they give me the creeps, there was one there earlier, I could have sworn he was watching us."" Julian muttered.  ""Oh, come on, your being a fussy worry."" Celeste responded back.Julian could be too darn serious, and right now she was.  ""Well, I got a wierd feeling from him."" Julian stuck to her guns.   Together they went into the house, and aunty got them ready for bed.  She made them each a peanut butter and banana sandwhich, a glass of cold milk.  ""Wait until next year, we didnt even play any games."" Celeste said, as they cuddled into an oversized bed.  ""We didnt do the bumper cars either."" She continued, sinking her head into the soft pillows.  ""You have to be kidding right, I think I have had enough of fairs for a long time, good night Celeste."" Julian was already in lala land, still thinking of that creepy clown."
The Big Blow Up,The Summer was coming to an end and I was about to start my top ten things to do list when I ended up with the worse top ten things I did list. It all started at a party and I was not a party person but of course Tessa begged me to come along. So at 6:30 it all started. Tessa came home at her normal time from work and she said that she wanted to go to her friend Katherines house for the biggest party of the year so of course I was studying and said no she begged and begged and finally I caved in.She was acting like a little puppy with her big brown eyes. We left at seven oclock and the night was arriving and the wind brushed across my back like an old friend.When we arrived it was loud not my scene. And every thing was fine until it wasnt I should have seen it coming when my phone died and Tessa was nowhere to be seen and then I tripped. I should have left but I stayed.Then next thing I know I was in the middle of the dance floor I pulled me in.Then some one spilled what I hoped was punch on me and that felt like a punch to the gut on my brand new white dress.I looked around for the first time taking it all in the light flashing music loud and it smelled like cinnamon.Then finally I passed a group of girls huddled in the corner and made it out side. Just my luck it started to rain cats and dogs.I thought to myself what else could go wrong and bad luck seemed to say good question.I thought to myself why did I do this to myself and thought back to Tessa and her big brown eyes. Remember that smell of cinnamon I mentioned well I found out what it was it was a big candle and my dress wich was on FIRE. My dress was ruined my reputation ruined and I was crying puddleds from my eyes. So I gave in and left Showed at home and climbed into bed and drifted off to sleep.The Summer was coming to an end and I was about to start my top ten things to do list when I ended up with the worse top ten things I did list.

Dare you to take the Mandela effect test with me..,"Dares? Sure, I can dare you. I take the dare almost every day since I awoke that day in 2016. Why? I expect like many people you are not from here. And if you are not from here and I am not from here. We have different stories to tell. Dare you tell me your story? I can tell you mine. I aint from here. That got me a trip to the shrink. Who stated I was living past lives. He wanted me to waste time with him. Scheduling me for one appointment after another. If you have read me, I dislike wasting time. So after the fourth appointment I proved to him he was dead. Kind of sad. But a truth. There were reason people did not dare me to do things in my reality. So you want to take a dare.. Fine, I dare you to take my test. And if you pass congratulations, you are from here. And if you do not pass? Well, we be traveling spirits to a dead past that died so many years ago that no one knows or. ANd here is the kicker for me. In a closed time curved loop, this reality just happened a moment ago to catch me to write this absurd story to you.What color is the sun? White, Yellow, Green, Blue?How close is earth to the center of the galaxy?How old is the earth?How old is the universe?Big Bang song is it 13 or 14 billion years or million years or thousand years?Jiff or Jiffy Peanut Butter?Captain Crunch or Captn Crunch?Abe Lincoln was a senator or just representative?Japan is off the coast of China or Korea?JC Penny or JC Penney is the name of the story?Sketcher or Sketcher the brand of shoe?Vote on the second Tuesday of November or the First Monday of November?How many states are in the United States?Russia has already told US that if attacked they will use nuclear weapons as a defense strategy.North Korea was given two EMP satellites from Russia in the 1990s that hang over Atlanta, Georgia, and California.Biden was arrested for trying to visit Mandela.Trump said lets vote day after Thanksgiving.Obama says there are 58 states in the United States.Bush Jr says that Mandela was killed by Saddam.And is it Sadam, or Saddam? Where was he captured? Was he hung or firing squad and what prediction did he state to the president when he was about to die. I know. Do you?Dares are something for me. Dare I tell you more? That your world died a long time ago? How could I prove that to my shrink? Oh, I can listen and learn. And? Most dead people want to get something off their chest and they talk and talk and talk. And? Thus in one reality they will tell you one thing and in another reality that is their secret and in a third reality not a big deal to go into that secret and in a fourth reality?You decide to tell the shrink his secret and diagnosis him and he does not like that. Not many people do. To be toyed with? Not really toying. Just annoyed that no one dares to talk with me these days about their personal lives. Their stories. Why? The first time a story is told is something new. A second time something changes you wonder why and third time with detailed questioning you can find out that the dare you took in the first place was something you either should or should not have done.The dares of late?Read what is in your vaccines.Several of the elements I knew were outlawed in my reality, and here they put them.Why? I suppose Revelation 6 plague and death would be my speculation.The same with the coming wars with China, Russia, Turkey. All pre-planned in an attempt to change reality of these worlds. Why?Who knows mans reasoning for wanting to escape fate. Personally was not much of a pirate or rebel. I was more into thinking and wondering why fate was fickle. And now? I realize that fate is real and that to escape fate is not the best desire in my good nature of surviving. what do I mean? I have heard of the stories where and what happens when they nuked Hawaii in December 2017 plus or minus moments or billions of years ago in a closed time curved looped.Dares? Did I take dares in my reality? Not at all. You see in my reality fate is real. What does that mean? Chaos or chance is not fickle or real. Meaning? Everything I did or do was written down and someone is reading it to me and I or you are doing exactly what we are told to do. So daring you to do something is like pre-arranged story telling and? Nothing is new under the sun. Dare me to answer how did they do this?Simple. In my reality the galaxy spun much faster than here. How much faster one cycle of the galaxy was 1,000 years and on the outside of the galaxy it was much more faster. Here? They say 230 to 250 million years earth travels around the black hole. And in my reality?That is the funny part of my galaxy was much larger 377,000 light years and? We had theories of black holes because we could make them in labs. However, in all the telescopes and all the math equations we had there not one single black hole was discovered. Why? Probably because we were going to hit the galaxy sooner by billions of years and they meaning black holes had dissipated.Dare I go on? How about you comment below your test scores and tell me are you from here or not? Dare I tell you of the worlds I have seen or stories I know? How about we exchange one for one. After a while you might find out something new. I dare you."
We.,"Rather unfortunate to be dependent on someone. Or liberating, might one view? For the two sides to the coin are quite fickle foes to each other, intermingling with the passing of each lively moment.  Viola nursed a drink in her hand, making an apt conversation with the Hodgersons, who were scrutinizing her life choices without much delicate finesse.  ""A nurse, dear? Why, hardly a time to be one. Surely the gardening business is blooming and ought to have beckoned you towards, don't you think Maya ?"" ""Certainly, dear,"" affirmed the red-haired wife. ""Also, pardon the intrusion, but you do look awful tired, dear. One might doubt as to what tending duties have caused such a state. The home or the ward, what is it, Vio ?"" The truth was it was the home. Little Bailey had been a nuisance to manage the past month. Quite a big boy now, Bailey. 10. She wagered if she ought to have struck the ""Little"" off the dashed one's title.  ""It's the ward,"" replied Viola warily, massaging her temples, and then looking around in a semi-furtive manner.  __________________________________________________________________________ It was awfully tricky business to mingle oneself with a large crowd,especially to the purpose of 'blending in', for try as hard as he might, Little Bailey might not have been able to puff himself up as the other goons, or either put up a commandeering voice capable of guiding the spirits of tame souls.  ""Well why must I bellow ?"" he inquired dispassionately of his peers, as they nursed a spot amidst a wedding.  The largest of them all, MacDonald, eyed Bailey with some comfort.  ""Well think about all the fun that would cause, Bailey! Come on, bellow a little. Draw on an attention to us."" Bailey seemed hardly encouraged by such a prospect. He eyed MacDonald with the air of sizing him up.  ""No,"" he simply said.  ""Excuse me ?"" leered the chap.  Bailey spotted his mother in the background. Terrible row he'd had with her that morning. Pertaining to how he seemed most incapable of lacking inquisitiveness as to her personal affairs. He only wished to know of the man she was seeing. Rather acutely she'd taken it. There was no hope of calling for her, though. She'd made it very clear that he was not to speak to her for an entire afternoon, so as to instill in him some 'good behaviour.' Bailey looked up at MacDonald and gulped.  ""Well, kiddo ?"" said the giant stepping forward, towering over Bailey like a brave shadow.  ""Oh sod it,"" said Bailey, punching rather meekly the brutes stomach. It created a slight chuckle in the affected party, before a hand swung forwards, making a very well acquaintance of Bailey's right cheek.  ________________________________________________________________________ Bailey sat nursing a swollen cheek, and giving him company, nursing a forlorn look herself, was Viola.  ""Not happy today, are we ?"" she inquired looking straight ahead.  ""Well I might have wagered a go at it if it weren't for the pain,"" reasoned Bailey nursing with a wet cloth, tenderly, the affected spot. ""You ought not to have been so strict, earlier, Mother,"" he continued, drawing a surprised turn from his beloved.  ""Indeed, Bailey? I've been wondering of the same,"" she said, regarding him in an affectionate way. But she then turned head and drew back to her honest assessment.  ""You ought not to be nosy, Bailey. It's quite rude. Who I see, and who I don't, it really mustn't concern you."" ""But we're family, aren't we ?"" reasoned Bailey.  She turned towards him and said : ""Be that as it may, an afternoon, Bailey. I realize I've indulged you in a semi one, oh !"" ""Oh leave it be, Mother,"" said Bailey frowning. ""I do have qualms of being dependent too, you know."" ""Qualms, where did you learn a word like that ?"" she inquired of the matter quite interested.  ""Cambridge Dictionary."" ""Ah."" They sat in silence for a few, before the Hodgersons came into presence again.  ""Ah, Viola, how lovely to see you, , sat here, looking quite...morose !"" beamed a gay Mr. Hodgerson. He was nursing his wife's hand in rather a pretentious manner, and of that regard, Bailey scoffed.  ""Excuse me, boy ?"" inquired the man of the sound.  Bailey merely shook his head furtively.  ""Go on now,"" said Viola urging her boy on. ""Off you go towards, sonny."" Bailey seemed most unkeen to abandon his Mother, but taking her command in good stride, departed.  ""Oi, chap,"" drew that brute's voice from nearby.  Bailey stopped and sighed exasperatedly. In previous times, he'd utilized the call of ""Mother !"" to succeeding effect, but right now, neither was present the scope of it, nor the opportunity, for Mother was engaged and rather afflicted with him.  The boy, MacDonald, drew upon him and laughed.  ""Quite a weak face you have there, boy,"" he said, and yet he was no more than ten himself.  Bailey looked longingly behind him at his mother, who seemed to be putting up a brave front towards the Hodgersons. He knew she was in no mood today. He then centered in to face the boy, and looking him in the eye said, ""Why don't you just really , MacDonald? I mean just scurry off somewhere and stop bothering people? Why don't you ?"" The boy seemed most amused of the suggestion.  ""Well who has fun getting lost ?"" he inquired heartily.  ""You might, if you gave it a shot."" MacDonald eyed Bailey severely.  ""A mouth on you, Bailey. Little, is it? Ha !"" Bailey eyed a familiar face in the background and his eyes lit up.  ""Oi, where do you think you're looking ?"" inquired a perturbed MacDonald.  ""It's my father !"" gleamed Bailey. ___________________________________________________________________________ ""Alright kiddo, settle down. Mother needs help, does she ?"" inquired he stooping below and taking him under his wing. ""Let's go help her out."" They walked towards Viola, who spotted them coming from afar, and adjusted herself to that manner.  'Ahem, ahem' scoffed the Father coming upon the scene. ""Interesting party !"" he affected. ""Ah, Jason ! Good to see you,"" roared Mr. Hodgerson. ""Been wondering where you were, with your lovely one standing here."" Viola eyed Jason and he eyed her back, and a brief smile sat on both their faces. Viola crossed her arms and looked at him in anticipation.  ""Well, Mr. Hodgerson,"" said Jason, ""sometimes a fella ought to leave his wife be, don't you think ?"" ""Leave her be ? What a preposterous suggestion !"" boomed Mr. Hodgerson. A look at Mrs. Hodgerson's face would have suggested that such a dawning would have been really welcomed had it found its lodging elsewhere, for instance within the man whose arm she currently nursed. ""That is so, Mr. Hodgerson,"" smiled Jason.  ""One doesn't  one, you see ?"" replied Viola from the side, as they both looked at each other and smiled knowingly. ""One can do very well without the other."" ""Must one ?"" countered a quick and sly Jason.  A faint blush arose on Viola's face.  ""Ahem, ahem, be that as it may, it is rather wrong to depart, in general that is,"" reasoned a slightly mellowed Mr. Hodgerson.  ""Bailey ?"" inquired Jason looking below. ""Your thoughts on the matter ?"" ""I think two bodies who need each other, ought to settle down and dig in with each other. Adaption comes at rather a cost."" And to signify the emphasis of his point, he rose a delicate hand towards his cheek.  ""Atta boy, Bailey,"" said Jason patting him on his head and then looking up at Viola. ""Rather tedious, adaption, don't you think, Vi ?"" Vi seemed most taken aback of being addressed directly. She steadied herself, and composed, answered, ""It's alright, I suppose."" Jason scoffed.  ""Well it ain't alright for me."" And then he faced her acutely, and held her hand.  ""Come on Vi, it's been months now. How has separation settled with you ?"" he whispered intimately to her. Mr. and Mrs. Hodgerson looked on with open mouths. ""I...I..."" she said, but feeling his hands in hers, she couldn't muster anything appropriate.  ""We need each other,"" said Jason, drawing Bailey into personal periphery. "", need each other, Vi."" Bailey looked up at his mother. His mother at him, and then away.  Jason's hand rose and tilted her face towards him.  ""Is it that hard to admit, Vi? Come on, let's be adults about this. I suck without you, don't you ?"" She laughed, rather losing footing of composure.  ""Oh Jason,"" and then she turned away again.  Jason looked at Mr. and Mrs. Hodgerson. ""She's almost there, ""he said encouragingly. Promptly nodded Mr. Hodgerson, and turned towards his wife, who tugged on his arm as if to spur on an exit. ""So long, Mr. and Mrs. Hodgerson,"" said Jason smiling his best smile, as the couple bowed and departed the scene.  ""So long,"" he drew once more, ""Mrs. Viola Smith."" He looked down at Bailey and inquired, ""Bailey, what might your mother's last name be ?"" ""Baker,"" growled a ferocious Bailey, suddenly blessed with an injection of spirit.  Viola blushed.  ""Really Jason,"" ""Really what ?"" ""There's another guy."" ""I'll wait,"" joked Jason.  ""Stop it,"" said Viola indignantly, punching him on the shoulder.  ""What ?"" said Jason playfully nursing his arm. ""Look, I'll be in the periphery, hanging around until you see sense. "" Viola laughed that laugh again, the kind she wished to dearly suppress but failed miserably at.  ""Need is a strong word,"" she said turning towards Jason finally. ""I can do just fine without you, Mr."" ""Yes but can  ?"" countered Jason, inching closer towards her, Bailey happy to be a mere spectator on ground level.  ""Perhaps not."""
The Man on the Porch,"I didn't know much about the guy next door when I was growing up. I didn't know his name, how old he was, if he was retired, or if he even had a family. All I knew about him was that he loved to sit on his rocking chair, on his porch. He was always sitting on it, looking out onto the road. It was like he was watching the world pass by.There was something about him that made me feel uncomfortable. Maybe it was the way he always sat on the porch, no matter what the weather was like. My brother and I use to always call him ""The Thinker"". Not because he leanedover in his chair with his elbow on hisknee, and his hand on his chin (which he didn't do). In fact,healways sat back in his rocking chairall relaxed.We called him""The Thinker"",because he always had an expression of thought on his face.The other thing that made me feel uncomfortable about him was how still he was. He would stare straight ahead. If he didn't move his head, and get up every once in a while I would have thought he was dead. He was almost old enough to be. Then there where the times my mom would be pulling out of the driveway, and would wave at him. He wouldn't respond, and mom would dismiss it saying, ""He must be in another dreamland"".I knew mom was giving him the benefit of the doubt, but I thought he saw and was just being rude.It wasn't until one day when my brother and I were throwing a baseball back and forth in the front yard that I truly met the man on the porch. I was practicing trying to catch long tossed balls. I played outfield on my baseball team, and wanted to get better. So my brother threw a very long and high ball. It threw right out of my reach! It went up and over our neighbor's porch rail, and landed right next to his rocking chair. I ran over to my brother and looked at him, ""What are we going to do? That's my only ball!""My brother looked down at me with a smirk, ""Well it's not like we lost it."" He pointed over the porch, ""Go get it. I'm sure The Thinker won't mind.""I remember cringing at the thought of going over there. What if he was mean, and snapped at me? I glared at my brother, ""You threw it. You get it!""My brother laughed, ""It's your ball! I don't care if you get it back."" Then he made a amused smile, ""I dare you to get it."" I groaned as I scrunched up my face. My brother knew I was never one to turn down a dare, and be a chicken. I let out a slow small breath, ""Fine, I'll get the ball, but will you wait here for me.""My brother smiled a victory smile, ""Fine, but make it quick."" And he sat down on our porch step.I remember approaching his porch with a knot in my stomach. I stopped right in front his porch rail, and knock on it like a door. He turned his head to me and blinked. Great...I had to make the first move. I swallowed, and spoke politely like my mother taught me, ""Hi Sir, my name is Frank Carry. I am your next door neighbor."" I paused, and pointed at my house, then at the ball on his porch. ""My brother and I were playing ball, and my ball landed on your porch. May I come up and get it?""Then to my surprise he smiled, and motioned to the ball. ""Of course you can Frank.""""Thanks, Sir!"" I said as I quickly went up to retrieve my ball. Once I had it I held it up for my brother to see. I smiled at the man, ""Thanks again,"" and I headed toward the stairs.Before I got down the stairs I heard the old man speak softly, ""I use to play baseball myself when I was younger. I was pretty good at it actually.""I turned around to look at him, ""Oh really?""He nodded, ""Yes. I started with pee-wee when I was just a boy. Then once I got older I was on my high school, and college team. My most fond memory however, is when the pros offered me a spot on the Red Sox.""I remember my eyes widening, and my jaw dropping, ""No way, you can't be serious!""He had laughed, and nodded, ""Oh yes Sir. I have all the proof needed: the trophies, the awards, the papers. There all right there in my house. I can go get them, if you would like."" He started to get up.I quickly glanced over to my brother, who was waving me over. ""Oh gosh sir, I would really love to, but my mother is almost done making dinner. Sorry, but thanks for letting me get my ball.""""Alright, maybe another time. It was nice meeting you officially Frank."" He called out to me as I ran down the stairs.The fallowing day my mind drifted back to what my neighbor had told me. I couldn't help, but want to know more about his story. So I made my next visit, but this time it was planned.He was right where I thought he would be, on his porch in that rocking chair. I greeted him, and asked if I could see that box he spoke of the other day. He smiled, and quickly said yes as he got up. He was in his house for roughly five minutes, before he returned with a large and heavy box. I helped him by taking it, and placing it lightly on the porch. I sat crossed legged in front of it, and he took a seat back in his chair.""What are you waiting for Frank, go on, take a look."" He said with a smile.So I did, and quickly found out that the box held more than just his memory of baseball. It held a story of his life. There were pictures, awards, letters, and so much more. I found out that his name was Roger Willson. He first started playing baseball at age five. He was the MVP on his high school team. He got a scholarship at the University of Tennessee. Mr. Willson even had a letter from the coach of the Red Sox. He was going to sign up to join, but before he got to he got drafted to the Vietnam war. While in the war he met his wife, Anna, who was a surgical army nurse. They met because he got a bad shot to his leg. A bad enough shot, that he had a permanent limp and a ticket home. If it wasn't for his leg, he could have had another go at baseball. But he eventually got over the sadness, and married Anna. They were married for 45 years, before she passed away. They lived in this very house for 31.I remember being amazed by his stories, and quickly befriended him. He was just misunderstood all this time. As for his nickname, ""The Thinker"", it stuck. He thought it was perfect, because he loved to think on his porch. As for my baseball team, we did pretty well. We had a new assistant coach named, Roger Willson. As for that one baseball I had; I got Mr. Willson to sign it. After all, he was almost a pro, and that was good enough for me."
"Too Stubborn To admit ,"" We need each other !""",""" "". -Suzanne An year back when everyone was being stuck at homes for the best, one night Suzzane got a link request on some social media for a connection. She kinda ignored it as it was not something new to her. She was hella pretty ans she kept receiving it , so she didn't paid the attention. She was fierce , independent , outspoken and blunt in her nature and attitude , so any common person was not able to understand her stuff attitude yet she has a soft melting heart. But , it was not for everyone. In her life till now where she is 25 has achieved enough her age. She was an app developer and a writer but also had experiences of facing shit as a result of her blunt nature. Since she was outspoken and emotional yet sometimes repeatable for sharing much of her stuff to people. She was kinda enjoyable in her own company till now and had 3 friends on fingers. And it was hard to believe hella pretty girl like her a snot in touch with any guy other than her work. She has moulded herself in her own niche.After quite a time , she randomly selected her connections on that social app. That guy used to draw her attentions by mentioning her in work related posts and all ans she noticed somehow and decided to see his profile casually .One fine day she posted her views on something brutal that was happening in the country and it takes courage to share one's opinion on a platform where you gets judged every time you do something . That guy , Shawn , talked a whole lot of that thing to her and she was also not reluctant to have a convo where sharing of opinions was prioritised. She casually did it. For the upcoming days , they started talking on different issues in the country and started sharing their opinions on diversified topics . She did too find it relaxing to do the same . Because, it was something new to her where any guy was doing the same rather than sugarcoating her about her beauty and boring stuff.Now , both started to develop sharing of opinions daily after dinner once get free from daily chores and work. Its was kinda therapy to both. Both decided to be in a zone of friends who are there for each other when it comes to talk about random stuff.  During weekends , they were in the same space and a consequence of some thought process , they started to talk about ""Boundations of being in relationships"". They conversed for about an hour in the same zone.  , as it's difficult to find someone where you can share your thoughts without being judged.At a point in their convo , there came a delusional contradicting points where Suzzane got her fierce and outspoken vibe to a. level where she kinda insulted him for having his thought process for the same as she thought his words were of an immature guy and not mature man , which she used to get anytime talking to him. Shawn was quite thoughtful about her sudden behaviour like this as she was not Like that since past days. He ended the convo with a sorry and didn't texted anything anymore. Suzzane went to sleep and was pretty confident about his texts the next morning as he used to greet him daily in the morning .She woke up the next morning and there was no text. since she have been dealing with the boys from past where no matter what , guys would have been responded inspite losing their self respect as her existence was more important than their self respect , so it was quite shocking for her to meet a man like him who didn't text as. sign of self respect.Few weeks passed and he didn't text neither she , yet both wanted to reconnect but was at fail.Both were waiting for the same but no was strong enough to step aside their egos and self respect to text the first.She was back to her normal routine yet sometimes missed a lot , those free convos .For the first time , she encountered a Taurian guy who didn't put efforts to maintain that vibe they used to carry. She was upset , but it was something new to her where guy didn't approach after heated argument .She was confused that even though things didn't went her way but the respect for him remained the same .She was even trying to figure out the same .One fine day , the place where she worked , a recent trainee joined in her team , so she was given the responsibility by her seniors to give the knowledge transfer to him about the work they do at their workplaces.  Since , the situation was pandemic & everyone was stuck at home , so every co worker was connected to one another through audio calls and meetings. She wanted a break but still agreed to do the same. She deliberately didn't tool much interest in the guy she was giving knowledge transfer to. That new intern was also kinda mute guy who just have its salvation only in listening . He sounded lazy to her so she just used to give her part and left the call and he used to clear the counts the next day !The same happened till the days when the time came , where one of the seniors was resigning off the company and everyone gathered virtually to bid him the farewell.She after a long time dressed quite official and attractive as around 50 people were there to Join that virtual Video farewell. She likes to dress up and she exactly did the same !That new intern was told to prepare a farewell speech as a token for appreciation as he was the language expert in his niche .She was expecting that she will get the responsibility for the same but anyways , she overcame that. The time that virtual meet started everyone wished each other and that intern came in for the main farewell speech . The time he started he wa son the main screen and suddenly he caught the attention of Suzaane !!!Boom ! That same Taurian guy , Shawn ....It took minutes for her to realise that this was actually happening . She felt safe but , was quite awkward too. She heard the full farewell bid and left that virtual meet and gave her kind words to one who was leaving the workplace personally. She was not able to sleep that night and was thinking of Shawn..She asked the database guy in office to do a background check for Shawn and then she realised he was the same guy he was giving that lessons on call during work hours. It was so emabrassing for her. She took a leave for few days from work and requested her senior officials to change her team as she didn't wanted to work with him for no good reasons. She joined back office but with different team with new people.Shawn was working into another team and she left no ways where they cold actually encounter each other once again.So , now Suzanne knows the whole plot and lets see till when Shawn will be unknown to the same plot and what will be his reaction to the same !!Even though Suzzane didn't commit , but somewhere in her heart she was also waiting for him to recognise the same.After all ,That Saggitarian woman never met a man like that Taurian guy , Shawn."
The Monster in the Dark,"I hate the darkness. Always reminding me of my childhood basement.The silence lets my mind wander. Often getting lost.No matter, here I sit. Locked in the library.Confined by darkness. Patrons have gone away.Night descends upon the building. Yet here I remain. I wander the halls. How is it I came to be here?Looking for my way out. One minute, I was reading.Enthralled in the plot. Wrapped up in the theme.The next minute darkness. Forgotten here.Put down like, a poorly written story.I run to the books. They have always been my guide.They glow with the light of magic. Even in intense darkness.They draw me in. Calling and beckoning me.My hands trace the letters. Lost in the dust.Just like me, waiting to be uncovered.As they glow, I pick one up and dust it off.I flip through the pages. The words jump off the page.The backdrop on the library fades into the darkness.A new place begins to take form.The magic transports me away from here.Unto a magical land of possibilities,I leave this world. I leave the pain of the past.Trading memories of him. For the hope of new love.Trading fear for adventure.Trading hurt for healing.I walk about the new land a free woman.The grass, the greenest green I have ever seen.The air, light as a feather. Sweet scents of flowersdance upon the breeze.The flowers smile at me as I brush past.The sea sits tranquil behind me. The smell of the sea, a comfort.I wander still, further in. Feeling lighter with every step.Headed for majestic mountains and a land of milk and honey.History lies in the mountains. Layer by layer the stories of the people.A land much like the promise land. A place where happiness and love abide.Along the way, dragons of old soar in the sky.Casting their large shadows upon the earth below.Languages unknown float on the breeze.Repeating primordial stories of heroes and gods.Castles of grandeur loom ahead. Beckoning me to come in.Their invitation I gladly accept.Dining with queens and kings. Laughing at court jesters.I am safe within their walls. A feeling unknown to me.Wars may rage on the outside, but peace is still with me.The time has come to leave the fortress. Trade my peace in for a battle.Upon a noble steed, I ride. To face down, fear personified.The ground beneath my feet, the wind in my hair,faster and faster, I ride. Rushing past the trees of the forest.Gliding over the fields of the prairie.my noble steed knows no fear.As he leaps into the air,jumping over creeks so fair.Dragons, ghosts, and goblins alike.Listen upon the wind and hear my battle cry.""No more, will you capture and terrify.""The monster awaits my arrival.He stands in terrifying form.Like my childhood nightmares, he snarls and growls.Claws gleaming in the light.His teeth inspiring fright.Imbued with evil that seeps from his black skin.The monster is as old as time itself.Upon his back, he carried the bones of his past opponents.All of which has failed.My sword was at the ready,but my fear grew immensely.My sword comes down upon the beasts, blow after blow.I fight with all my strength. I do not know if this is a battle I can win.Or if the fear will overtake me this night.For the battle is not just of this world.But also, a battle of the mind.The beast possesses special magic.Drudging up your deepest fears.The past flashes before my very eyes,I watch him take what is not his,I watch him chase me up the hall,And back down again.I watch my tears flow as I cower in the corner.""Protect the baby"" I hear myself whisper.The memories are too strong.The magic of the demons is winning.In my last attempt to overcome this evil,with all my might I plunge my sword into the monster.The blood and pain flow freely.No longer do the memories plague me.Clear is my mind, and light is my heart.I have won the war. Declared the victor,I stand in the field. Weak with exhaustion.Covered in the blood of the demon.The wind roars my name.The people sing my praise.But unworthy am I. I am but a person.I am not a goddess or hero. I am but human.I have fears I bleed red, as all living things do.The smell of the flowers is even sweeter.The sun has come to see the victory of life over death.I drink in the moment like sweet wine.I become drunk on joy.Upon my horse, I mount once more,retreating to the fortress to lick my wounds.For like any war, it is not without injury.I enter the iron gates. They close behind me.A heavy clank signifying my safety,music plays in the courtyard, singing of my bravery.Retreating to my chambers, I climb the stone stairs.I lay upon the softest bed, covered in pure satin.My eyes are heavy, and my body is tired.The satin sheets envelop me as I drift off to sleep.The story goes on as I sleep.People fall in and out of love.Some get married and others die.Babies are born and they grow up and repeat the cycle.The cycle of life and the cycle of the story,As for me, I awake, much to my delight.I find that someone has turned on the lights.Once more, I find that I have returned.As though I have never left.Every night is just the same.For I am the ghost of the stories,like a well-told story, I am immortal.I remain after everyone has gone.               ."
Book talk,"The sun is slowly setting, while I am moving at the speed of light. The book I need for tomorrows test can only be found in one library: the one across campus. Ten minutes till it closes and I still have to look for the book. Ill be there in five, I hope ...The librarian looks at me with that familiar look of hers; she knows me and knows that I am not the most organised person in the world, unlike her. Normally, I would have the book ready for you Jenny, but not this time. This time you can look for it yourself, she says. 	Sorry, Im so late, but I almost forgot about this test, and  Im so out of breath that I cant even finish my sentence.	No worries, you can do what you normally do when you come rushing in like this, but remember, the library closes in five minutes. And dont expect any help from me, this one is on you!	While trying to catch my breath, I almost forget the book I need. I remember it was something with Johnson and Delong, about the history of writing, but all I can find is some contemporary stuff. I am in the wrong place without time. 	Miss Knight, could you please give me hint about where to find a book by Johnson and DeLong about the history of writing?	Well, it should either be in the writing isle or in the history section, but either way it will be somewhere in the back, she said. She walked towards me with her dainty tread. In a hurry, but still lady like and quiet. A true librarian. 	I simply cannot seem to find it, but Ill try the history section, I replied. Miss Knight didnt answer, but I was sure I would find what I was looking for soon. As I turned round the corner, I saw a small shadow moving rapidly across the floor. It was like a book falling to the ground, but I didnt hear it hit the floor. 	Miss Knight, is that you? Still no reply. Weird, but fine, books fall sometimes, especially when the shelves are a bit messy. As I ran my eyes across the books that I was sure kept the book I was looking for, I touched them with just the tip of my fingers. Moving rapidly, the backs of the old books felt soft and rough at the same time. But, before I could touch another book, my heart skipped a beat. I jumped back before I realised what I saw, or rather, what was seeing me.  A pair of yellowish eyes looked at me from the bookshelf I had been looking at moments before.  I thought to myself as I slowly moved towards it. The eyes kept staring at me. For a second, I thought it was just a picture, but then they moved. I opened my mouth to scream, but before I could make a sound, a small creature, the likely owner of the eyes, put its hairy finger on my mouth as if to say: keep quiet, please.	Black, all black was the last thing I saw before the floor came hurtling towards me. 	My first thought when I woke up was that I had been dreaming. But the rude awakening came with the yellow eyes staring at me again. Somehow, this creature looked kind of cute, so I wasnt afraid. Although I had never seen anything like it, I trusted that it wouldnt harm me in any way. The eyes were friendly, friendly yellow eyes, weird though.	Hi there little friend, what in the name of history writers are you? I asked. The question was for me, so I didnt expect it to answer. But it did.	Hi there, I go by the name of Corlin. A book demon is what I am. But dont worry, I wont hurt you. You like books, right?	Uhm, yes, I like books. But did you say you were a demon?	Why yes I am, I have been all my life.	Arent demons supposed to be, you know, from hell, or something? I was getting curious.	Different kind, the little creature responded. We are not evil, and we do not try to make people do bad things. Taking care of the books is what we are meant to do.	Thats nice, I replied. What a response. My first chat with an actual demon and what do I say? Thats nice! I am a moron, a smart moron, but still. 	Did you by any chance drop a book before, you know, I fainted?	No, I did not, that must have been Eggsy, hes still getting used to his new form, hes a bit clumsy right now.	 I thought. 	Yes, Im sure. I named him myself.	This is getting weirder and stranger, furry little creatures with yellow eyes, that say they are book demons. I am definitely dreaming.	Corlin, do you happen to know what happened to miss Knight? I didnt hear from her when I called.	Shes gone home for the night; the library has been closed for a few hours already. And by the way, Eggsy is not furry like me, he is more like a little dragon at the moment.	Hold on one moment, did you read my mind just now, about Eggsy? 	Why yes, I did, I do that sometimes. I think it makes me special because I have yet to meet someone who can do the same. I also happen to know humans cannot do anything like it.	Corlin seemed friendly enough, but if I had indeed been asleep for a few hours, and the library is now closed, then how am I supposed to get out of here? And also, this simply cannot be real, can it? I mean, book demons, mind-reading, these things only happen in fantasy.	Corlins eyes grew big as he glanced over my shoulder, he was looking at something. I turned around to see what it was, but there was nothing there, nothing but books anyway.	What is it, I asked. He seemed scared. I turned back around and Corlin was gone. In his place was a small lizard with bright white eyes staring at me. It could not have been more than a foot long, seemingly friendly. But the eyes, the eyes were piercing through me, like it was staring into my soul. It made me feel weird, a bit dizzy even. I set aside my fear and spoke to the little creature.	You must be Eggsy, right? The lizard didnt move, nor did it speak. Instead, it just starred. 	Suddenly a white fog started creeping up on us. The small lizard scurried away. 	Theyre here  I heard a familiar voice say. 	Who are here, Corlin? I whispered. 	The others, they have come. 	I didnt know who or what to expect after what I had just seen, but I thought it best to keep quiet, for now. As I found a little corner, behind the bookshelves to hide behind, this ritual unfolded in the middle of the library. The white fog from before filled the centre of the library, and from it, small creatures of different shapes and sizes started to appear. 	You shouldnt let them see you, Corlin whispered. He wasnt hiding anymore, but he sounded anxious. 	What do you mean? Who are they?	They are the other demons, and theyre not all friendly like me.	Corlin sounded serious, the tone of his voice had changed. I couldnt believe my eyes, there were all sorts of creatures emerging from the fog.	Why are they all here? I asked Corlin. But he didnt answer. I saw him move to the centre of the library. He started speaking in a language I could not understand. His voice was deep and dark, it didnt fit his appearance at all. But then the fog disappeared, and he started speaking in English once more.  I thought to myself. 	I am talking to you in human tongue, so that we may practice the language of the books as we always do, Corlin spoke. He had answered my question. 	A dark voice replied from somewhere I could not see. 	What happens to be on the menu for today, Corlin?	On the menu? Are they going to eat something? Am I on the menu? Suddenly, I was feeling nervous. 	On the menu for today are some books about writing, Corlin said. They have been approved by both Eggsy and myself.	Corlin seemed proud of what he said. I still just couldnt believe what was going on. 	Then let us begin! A loud high-pitched voice sounded through the entire library. It was Eggsy. The lizard demon who had starred at me but had not spoken a word. I think he was a bit scared of me. 	Young human! Would you mind coming out of hiding, I assure you, you will not be harmed. Eggsy spoke. I couldnt believe he was addressing me. Shaking with nerves I stepped out of my comfort zone, into the light. 	Well, hello there darling, how nice of you to join us. You didnt think we hadnt noticed you, did you? a bright red bird spoke. 	I was kind of hoping you hadnt, I said with a nervous grin. 	No worries my child, Im sure you are aware of the fact that we are not like you. We are book demons as Corlin told you. We had been watching you for a moment because we heard that Corlin had made contact with a human. This is quite rare you see.	Is it? Well, I could not have guessed. Sarcasm is my defense mechanism when Im nervous. But what brings you here? I asked.	Well, my dear, isnt it obvious? We consume books.	What does that mean? Do you eat them?	No, not exactly. You see, we are book demons because we love books. We live off the energy they hold within. And by consume, I mean we consume the energy, it keeps us strong.	If things werent weird enough already, they were now. 	Maybe it is best if I simply invite you to join us in our little club. We call it book talk; youll see why.	All the demons gathered in a circle of the library, where they waited for Corlin and Eggsy to arrive with a set of books. These were carefully placed in the middle of the circle. Then came the fog again. The fog covered the books and drifted around. The demons started dancing and moving in funny ways like they enjoyed the feeling of the fog. 	Go ahead, open your mind and let the fog touch your skin, Corlin said. 	I did as I was told, it made me dizzy. But it also felt like I was in the books. At first, it was hard to make sense of all the information, but the more I let my guard down and let the information flow through me, the more I understood. 	Do you do this every night? I asked. 	Yes, we do, we love it, and we need it. But we are not always in the same place. Sometimes it takes us a while to come back to a place like this. This is because we have to use humans to scout for good places to visit. But Ill explain that later. Now it is time for the second part. Corlin explained.	The red bird spoke again: Now we discuss!	Every demon around me started talking to the one next to them, Corlin and Eggsy were busy as well. It took me a moment to realise what they were doing. But they were discussing the contents of the books. 	This is why we refer to it as book talk because we always discuss the books we consume, Eggsy said.	As I joined them, I forgot about the exam from the next day, I forgot why I was even there in the first place. It felt like a dream, but it was so lifelike that it could not have been a dream. Slowly but surely though, the fog and the demons started disappearing around me, and I hardly even noticed. My rude awakening came when I heard miss Knight.	Are you alright my dear? You hit your head pretty hard.	What? I hit my head? I asked confused.	Yes, you did. Do you know where you are?	I am in the library, but it is closed.	Well, not yet, but we are closing soon. I was just about to tell you that I had found the book you were looking for, but then you turned around and hit your head against the bookshelf. You fell to the ground and were gone for a second there.	I was? I was so confused; I could have sworn I had met some book demons.	Are you able to walk home or should I call someone? She asked kindly.	Im sure Ill be fine, Im just a bit dizzy.	Well alright then. Here is the book you needed, I found it on the table. Although I could have sworn it hadnt been there when I walked past it before.	I got up, took the book from miss Knight and made my way to the door. I looked at my watch and noticed it was about four minutes till closing.  I thought to myself.	You had a good time, I heard a voice whisper.	I turned around one last time before I walked through the door, and I saw miss Knight looking at me with a concerned face. But in a second her face turned friendly, she smiled and her eyes glowed yellow for a moment. Then, as quickly as it changed, her face turned back to normal. I hurried home and that night, I dreamt about the history of writing. Go figure!"
Friends and Forever,"You can see her in the distance, perched on a branch--feet dangling to and fro when the crack of the rising sun commences. You can still see her slight figure when the sun cowardly sinks into its daily game of hiding.She comes into the house with shoes full of leaves. She says its to keep the tree always near her. I say its only for spite because as she stated yesterday, I dont give her enough freedom.Shes loved that useless, big piece of bark the way I wish I loved her father. Hes not here now-hes gone--gone like that rascal of a child is now, up to nothing but mischief in that old hunk of bark.She writes poems about that tree, sings about that tree, darn! She lives for that tree!Ask me why she loves that piece of nothing, I wont be able to tell you a single accurate answer. I Have asked her on numerous occasions and every time she rewards me with a different answer.The first time:I like it because its the only place I can be alone in my headThe second time:It reminds me of papaThe third time:I can see everything from thereAt this point, I've given up trying.--She sits next to me during dinner tapping those wretched green streaked shoes on my polished linoleum as she swiftly scoops spoons of rice messily into her greedy mouth. Once she finishes she asks:Can I go play in my tree?I say no.Crystal tears stain her rosy cheeks.I hate you she screams as she stomps into her room full of leaves; undismissed.I know she does.--She comes in with dirt clinging to her pale arms, hands, and fingers. Her green eyes are shiny-clear as she hands me an open letter.Mommy, do we have to leave home?Shes honest, unblossomed, innocent, and even more childlike than her 11 years. Her eyes are as wide as my silver spoons; they are covered in fear. Her hands shake and then she's all vibration and all kinds of anxiety. Shes all angst and fear. Shes the epitome of anxiety and I--I don't know what to say, but words roll off my tongue and suddenly, Id do anything to protect my baby girl No honey, Mommy will figure it out, okay?A week passes by languorously. I go to work, fill out sheets, speak, receive calls, answer calls, repeat. The money still isnt enough.She doesn't go up to her tree in the playground across the street. I can see her silhouette on the couch gazing at the cracks on the ceiling. Her eyes no longer have the glow of youth and play nor the excitement of getting dirty every day.I ask her if she is okayshe says no.I know she hates me.--Were evicted from our home. I couldn't pay the bills on my own since her dad left us. It was a battle each time I sat at the round table in the kitchen trying to make ends meet.We have a week, and I pack and we move into my mother's small flat; she is welcoming but there is no tree for my baby to climb and there is no joy in her eyes. Her green eyes quickly become pools of water and one small splash will make them overflow out of their unstable container.She asks if she can go play at her tree.I say yes.She brings a Knife.I go with her.I strain my neck to view long limbs of mighty, dark brown branches that are decorated with an amenity of green leaves. Its beaconing branches and deep roots call her and she etches into the barkShe had many memories with that tree and its hard to bid ado and after she says goodbye, we leave.The air tastes sour and the clouds outside are grey. This train moves and leaves green things behind. I strain my neck backward, forcing myself to see what had once passed before my sight. In this trance of mine, I view the ancestral arms of stoic wood and bark connected to its massive trunk. The trees beaconing branches and deep roots ring familiar to me in contrast to this unfamiliar place. Like seconds, this scene passes, and incomes another, another, and anotherA girl is crying to her mother.A boy is picking a fight with his brother.A mother soothes a crying baby, cooing softly to it, whilst holding the living, breathing, and noisy creature snug against her chest.Someone's eyes feel heavy like bricks and someone's head craning position starts to recede into a slouched one. This same someones head is now drooping and soon enough this someone is snoring, and this someone has a dream and that someone is me and this was my dream:Someone's hands lifted as to rub out the sleepiness from their dark-brown eyes and someone elongated their body in an act of stretching their rigid bones. Someone's eyes are now open and that same someone looks around and that someone is me and I see that:The girl has stopped crying and is now leaning against her mother's shoulder-- sleeping.The boy has stopped fighting.The babys wails of frustration are no more as it lays silent, asleep and protectively tucked against the bosom of its mother.Stepping out of the train, luggage in hand, I attempt to climb out of my dreams of trees and isolation. Reaching into my vibrating pocket, I take out my phone and am greeted by the voice of my mom: Are you here yet?I want to say I am not here because my mind is elsewhere, but I replyYes, I am here.""It confounds me how time passes by so quickly when you dont pay it any mind. Time is relative- I dont see it as a law of how it is always supposed to be. Time is just human-made--and like my rebel self, I simply dont abide by it. So, when I glance at my phone screen and see that it is 2:00 pm, I am taken aback.A black sedan parks in the parking lot and a woman with hair-like stretched arms of a massive tree lounged in the drivers seat.Her head swivels towards me as I catch her eye and I gather my things to go meet her. My steps toward her are slow. I lift my right foot and put it forward and do the same with my left.Why do I feel so scared? She's just a woman that happens to be my mom.Hello SalHer mouth forms the words but I cant hear her as my vision starts to blurThis cant be happening. I haven't seen her for 2 years.Hey MomShe passes by me to put my luggage in the truck and I notice how thin she has become.Ma, I can take it, I say as I reach for the bag.---Mom pulls up to a park and I see that same tree from my childhood. A girl with green eyes is sitting on a branch. Her legs move to and fro and she is gazing blankly at the sky.****You can see her as her feet dangle from the branches of that tree. She is happy and she visits this same tree every time she can. It has been 24 hours and 365 days since we left this place that I call home.I sit on the nearby bench and watch her as she stares blankly at the sky and for the first time in a long time, I smile.A girl approaches her, she has black hair and dark brown eyes. She comes out of a black sedan that is beaten up and wild looking like the lugubrious woman in the driver's seat.The girl says something that makes my baby smile.She says:""I used to visit this tree when I was a child. This is where I met my best friend before she left, we wrote this:She says this as she points to the faded markings.My baby nods and points to the writing that she made before we left our home.It says:The girl joins her on the branch and together they stare blankly at the cloudless blue sky."
Once upon a Tree,"A tree is alive long before it acquires its place in the earth. An insignificant seedling untangles itself from a birds wing; I float down at the whim of the wind and, before long, I arrive onto the generous soil that will become my place in the world for the adventurous centuries to come. I use all ofnaturesselfless circumstances, to thrive. I push below and rise above. Sunlight streams top to bottom over every grateful surface. Omniscient weather anticipates my each need. I need rain and rain arrives. Harmony abounds. Bucolic scenes prevail above and below. Above, I cast a shadow wide and proud. Below, ticklish insects move the soil around my growing, inquisitive feet. Patient decades of changing seasons support my purpose: to be tall in the world. Mightier than those around me; noble and humble.Man arrives.At first, insignificant expeditions, carrying shinning cyclops peepers that shoot red laser beams which burn with the measuring of the profitable abundance about me. Before long they multiply and I am witness tothe wide-spread destruction of my beleaguered family. Birds desert this, now Mordor, land. A different abundance grows, a cancer, when, other species of tree arrive. Fastened, unwillingly, on top of angry, deafening machines that scar the earth with tracks. This novel breed of tree are flat and sad and dead and become pressed into the walls of the buildings that grow faster than any living tree I have ever seen.It is a wonder I am here to witness it at all because an abundantly bearded ogre arrives hoisting a grumbling, smoking machine for cutting. Hey not that one! Shouts another bearded beast. We use that one for shade at lunchtime. Disappointed, the man leaves with the re-determined ambition of removing other inconvenient impediment.Humble red stones arrive. They are plastered together with a grey poisonous glue. They demarcate the structure maturing alongside me. The cancer grows as far as I can see.Inquisitive eyes arrive, filled with a lust for land. Look daddy! delights a budding human, a small girl-child. That one! That one! We can build a tree house in that tree! Under the soft humidity of my branches, I witness a document signed.And so, I meet Sarah and her younger brother Matt, who with Fathers help, build a tree house inside my voluminous canopy. We are the gleeful envy of all the neighborhood little-ones.Matthew come inside! Dinners ready, calls Mother from the house with a final impatience. When she uses his full name, Matthew, instead of the affectionate, Matt, he knows to mind her. Matt, grumbling, leaves the tree house, down the wooden ladder nailed into my wizened trunk. I dont mind. My skin is as tough as the soles on their shoes. Day by day, they bringjoyful energy. The tree house is where, at the age of sweet 16, Sarah experiences the dreamy excitement of her first kiss. And when Karl, the neighborhood bully, punches Matt in the arm, hard enough to make him cry, I trip him with one of my roots hidden beneath the leaves I left there. Rosemarie the purple flowered bush helps me, an accomplice, a supplemental impediment. Karl falls and chips his front tooth. He scurries away howling.The children grow up and abandon me in search of superior academic ambitions. Mother and Father sell the house and for lonely seasons society forsakes me, except for the time Mrs. Lilys cat, Chestnut, traps himself at the end of one of my long branches. Burly men arrive in a noisy machine and extend a long white sprout that germinates faster than any tree I have ever seen.One of the men harvests Chestnut from my branch and now designated to being an""inside cat"" I never meet him again.Other colonials arrive and they buy the house. They bring with them a crying baby and as seasons pass, Ryan matures into an adventurous youngster with high-reaching ideas and world-wide ambitions. On the opposite side of the tree house he hangs a single rope with a bulging knot at the endfor swinging. He uses it with such joyous frequency the rope rubs a smooth ring on my resilient skin. My voice is but the whispering of a wind through my branches, far too soft to warn him on the soggy, rainy day when he catapulted,higher, higher and higher and slipped and broke his arm. Deplorably I endure a lonely season without any children. Ryan ventures out seldomly to use the swing. His injury has matured him with doubt. He comes out to keep me company with greater infrequency and never again in the rain. The new neighbor, Angela, flies her splendidred kite into my branches. As she watches anxiously Ihelp Ryan untangle it from my limbs. It see-saws on the wind below to land victoriously at their feet. He is her hero. They fall in love. I am theirguardian and one day they hide from the rain under my canopy. They kiss for the first time beneath my umbrella. The rain brings out the mischief in me; with the slightest breeze I shimmer my branches and a profusion of affectionate droplets shower down upon them. Holding hands they race into the house, screaming in ecstasy.Summer breaks her promise of joy when, in the tree house, Angela tells Ryan she no longer loves him. She leaves in an awkward, guilty hurry. Ryan cries. If my limbs were capable of it I would embrace him. I send him all my positive energy, but, with an inconsolable mood he abandons me for the last time.A pernicious grey steel crawls across the sky and a biting cold coerces all life into shelter. People, pets, birds and even the mischievous squirrelsdesert me. My branches wilt, my leaves dry. A pestilent Autumn approaches. A late, violent, rain dashes the fragile leaves from my branches like sodden, severed hair. They fall and rot about my determined trunk with brown decay. Such a repulsive season I have never witnessed before.Circumstances, infused with depravity, bring pregnant purple skies and light, meagre as it is, hides from the flashing incandescence above and the vengeful shadows below. A final eruption from the hell above spears me with white fire, impossibly hot. Unstoppable, merciless fire envelops me.A serpentine, incendiary orange pulls the tree house from my branches. It tumbles in stages; chunks of smouldering wood hiss and writhe amongst the rot below.And I burn.But since you are aware that I am the author of this story, you are also aware that a tree's purpose is never done.Inquisitive green buds peek out of my every available surface and I sprout faster than any tree I have ever seen."
Dyna,"Do you want to die here or to die outside in nature?Wh..what ..what are you saying ?Im asking a simple question; do you prefer to die here or to die outside ?Anthony please these things arent funny at all and besides I am very busy right now.So please tell me what you want rapidlyDyna is dying he said agonizedly.The ruler closed the door of the room and sat down in a sigh with some fury.Who Did it? He asked.We still dont know anything but I was checking it while the flowers were starting to wrinkle and also the device got received a radiation.We only have 10 masks and we are 50 , you are the ruler you decide so....Do you want to die here or to die outside?Anthony I know that we are in a critical situation right know at this station but as a ruler I am asking you not to tell anybody about this, I dont want them to worry about the process of relocating them and I will take care of it ..................................................................................................................................The disaster started 5 years ago, when there was a great leak of nuclear radiation in the air as a result of an explosion in some nuclear power stations that was built by some countries to defend themselves against each other , there was a spark of a great war again.It ended up in a crisis. Earth was destroyed in fact most of it but there were some survivals, these survivals were even very far away from the nuclear stations or they were too near to (Dyna) the name that Anthony blank gave to these flowers, it was found that these flowers had a massive super power of absorbing the radiation and emitting oxygen instead of it , people who were around the area of Dyna were all safe but every thing instead of that was vanished.We are now only a few people on this big land, we decided to assign a ruler for every group of people and to build something like a shield for us to protect us from the radiation. We built 17 stations with the wreckage and put gods gift (Dyna) in every station to protect us from any other leakage. Every station includes between 25 to 75 people according to the location of it.How do we live ? ...simple, the river is near to us so we can get water, And our great scientists have come up with a way to make all the food that was affected by radiation edible and also the fish in the river. This time when you realise that only founding food and water is a great achievement for all of us, this time you think about your old life, your family who were destroyed by this leak as some countries were trying to show their powers.Dyna is a rare plant, and unfortunately it is endangered, but the good thing is we have it here and also we made some masks with its leaves , at our station there are 10 and in other stations there are 5,15,20 its all about the flower. We communicate with other stations by some radio devices we made. We are building a new world for us using the old technology.............................................................................................................................you know exactly what can cause the Dyna to die Alan , and you insisted on doing it, so now its your turn to rescue us, to rescue 50 of the people who survived from the environmental disaster and then you chose to kill them  Anthony roaredyou were my chancellor Antho and all of us know your powers, you could stop me Do not utter meaningless words because this will not help now , we must do something .How much time do we have until the radiation ...... Alan askedonly 2 hours before we are all dead you know that the nearest station in the area is about 3 and a half hours of walking from here, and we only can risk ten lives to try to get some help for us, I know that station 4has 2 extra dynas but its 5 hours from here, the masks can stand for only 7 hourshe continued.That means they will die during returning here...., UselessAlan saidIt was necessary and obvious that now in this critical situation, someone must take the first step and sacrifice himself for the others , for the continuity of man kind on earth. You only need to summon your strength and courage to be the leader, the pioneer that the other 9 guys will see and tell themselves we must be like him. Anthony was that man, he is brave, strong and loves to help others. Another 6 men and 2 women joined him randomly . Alan was number 10 as it was a surprise for Anthony but no time for this. People were arguing about why are you going out and using the masks that we have for some more help as Alan the ruler said this in the station to prevent any unnecessary mess in the station as it will not help and also he wanted to keep his good reputation between people there.The destination is station 4, the duration: unknown. That was the information they have until now.Wearing the masks, and a protective suit, everything was ok. The maps is with them with a compass. Only them Anthony and Alan know about what happened but the other 8 have been told that they are on a mission to get some more stuff that was needed..........................................................................................................The only thing that can harm the Dyna and make it useless is when you try to cut a part of its leaves At a time other than the specified time for the flower to throw its leaves that we made the masks from, every year it throws 2 leaves so we have 10 masks, Dyna is long live plant, these thrown leaves are growing again the next year so it can throw 2 more and it also depends on the area as there are some flowers of Dyna that throw 4 leaves a year or 5 leaves a year but it depends.Alan tried to cut a part of its leaves to make some more masks, he intended to make only 2 ,one for himself And another one for Anthony or Albert as they were the 2 scientists in the station. He wanted to go out, to discover the world and how it looks like after 5 years of isolation and to find a way out of this station or even a bigger place to stay In. The intentions were good but the execution wasnt, he offered Anthony to do this with him and he refused without any thinking as he knew that this step will put many lives at risk, their researches on Dyna had a 60 percent risk of losing the flower so by the way losing our lives you will only gain a life or two of those who will wear these 2 masks.Albert timidly agreed not like Anthony, he was Tempted by what will be waiting for him outside as Alan said to him, they only know the river and the area beside it but he wanted to discover the life around him and he did not care about the dangers that hinder this experience.we will be free Albert, may be there are people who survived in this world, may be there is another life to live in, we are prisoned here and this will not help us, I am sure that there are people other than us believe me Albert its your chanceAlan was persuasive and Albert wanted this........................................................................................................Its 5 am the radiation out is at its lowest, it will be like this for another hour so they decided that this is the best time to move. They have the last 10 masks on the station if anything happened the station is dead..Anthony and Alan moved in the front and the 8 were behind with some swords and knives they made at the station. Alan left Albert as a ruler instead of him until his return.if anything bad happend you will be responsible for the death of 50 people, you are doing what you wanted to do now right Anthony mockedplease stop being a kid and try to help us, try to help yourself or you want to meet your daughterAnthony grapped him out of his suit putting his face in front of him  dont even say a word about my daughter or I will cut of your head and he pointed with a knife to his neck.Some men ran rapidly to them to see what happened ,  no problem, we were just talking go back to your place Alan said.don't forget that I am still the ruler, Ill forgive you about this but once again you will be there and he pointed to a place where there was a burnt trees and some dead bodies of the died men in stations.Its 6:07 the radiation levels is increasing gradually according to the devices with them. They should hurry up as the radiation increase the ability of the Dyna masks is affected. They stetted their destination from the beginning and their path is clear so the first hour had passed safely. They decided also that the second hour will not be like the first, they will run, they need to save some time, the 10 men who are out knows to well that the risk of losing their lives are high and also they have no families waiting for them they are alone,and that what made them brave enough to do this mission, they were determined to return back to their station to help the people there.Its 6:08, one of the back men had fainted, he was Jerry, he is an engineer and he holds the maps, they ran quickly towards him, before they found out the bitter truth, Jerry has gone, its the radiation, it was a shock for all of them as he was wearing a mask like them all. The shock wasnt clear on Alans face, it looks like he predicted it. Jerrys face color has been changing at first it was only some red spots on his front then his face turned into red completely before some blood went out of his mouth, it was the effection of the radiation, Alan grabbed Anthony from his hand to move fast , they must move quickly there is no time for staying there in front of his body, they decided to bury him after the mission of there is enough time. The tension is starting to appear on the group.Only half an hour later and another woman fainted and turned into red alsojust like Jerry.No thats not right, it must be something had happened to them Anthony screamedAlan tried to grab him again to move but that time he refused and insisted on checking the mask. Let me check that mask, dyna cannot do this he continuedAnthony took the mask up and he was right this is not Dyna, its a fake mask. He screamed in the face of Alan and the group, at this time there was a sword on his neckjust move or I will cut off your headAll of them was shocked to see Albert, with the real mask. He faked 2 masks with a fake flowers that looked like the Dyna, and he is wearing one of them .good to see you Albert, always on time said AlanYes sir, sticking to the planAnthony wasnt understanding what is happening around him are Alan and Albert planning to betray us!!you ignored my plan Antho, and he agreed, he is loyal to me, but you can show your apology right now, you have two options, the first one is to go with us to a new life, a new place after we take the Dyna with us orrr, you want to see little Dyna again, I think if she was between us now you would chose to be with us, make your choice you have only 30 secondsall of them agreed on that plan Antho, these 8 are with me, I hope you join us he continued. you killed 2 of your people just to explore a new place, youre such a despicable animal, I will not let our station down, the people are waiting there for us, think of them I made this because I think of them, I wanted to get them and us out of this station, to set us free, to explore another place to live in and you are able to help us, think about the kids there, if your daughter was one of them wouldnt you think of a better place, they are like prisoners and I will save them no matter what, every progress in our live needs a sacrifice and the lives of these people who died for us are the sacrifice, they must be proud of themselves now Alan explained.Albert was still putting the sword on Anthonys neck, he suddenly smiled without any reason and looked in Anthonys eye when a noise sound came from the right from where they left the station.!!!!Alberts followers, they were about 30, some were from his station and the other were from station 4, they believed in the idea, they believed the story of freedom, no matter how many lives will be destroyed.He dropped the sword down and went to his followers, he also betrayed Alan, they had the flower itself with them, the stole it from their station, station 4. Now its done the people of the station will be died, Alan is betrayed and the 6 men who were alive with them has no chance to live but to go with Albert.Anthony was committed with his word, he will save the station, not to give up, to make his daughter Dyna proud of him, he named the flower which is the reason to keep them alive after her name, because she gave him life, but the Dyna is with them, they are 30, Alan is betrayed and may be he is going with Albert.Its a hard choice you can live safely with a group of people looking for the freedom but you will be a traitor to your people or you can die trying to save the people who trusted you. Anthony is brave but he is a wise man. He will do what is best for himself.Would you die trying !!!!!"
The rid of unwanted Librarian / Library,"When discussing their picked calling to an overall crowd, custodians definitely hear ""You should truly adore books!"" And while this is likely valid for a significant number of us, I have discovered that it's the non-curators who appear to be more appended to books, regularly derangedly along these lines, particularly while doing their own weeding projects or seeing our own. Book deal gifts, while superb for gathering pledges, can be the most despicable aspect of our reality when they contain such jewels as midcentury ""Reference book Britannica"" sets, also whatever untamed life took up inhabitance in the crates while they were in the storage room or carport. Also, on the off chance that you attempt to deny such materials with your gift strategy, you are met with resentment about how costly the set was when new and that ""there's still a ton of good data in there!"" Also, it tends to be difficult for curators to settle on choices about old, costly, recently loved materials. The greatest thing hindering you of having an incredible assortment is that your racks are stopped up with old things. They haven't coursed or been utilized in ages and you realize they should go, however how to manage the materials that have been weeded? Regardless of whether the books are gifts or disposes of, ensure you exhaust associations, for example, the American Rescue Workers, Goodwill, Salvation Army, Military Order of the Purple Heart, and so on Contact your neighborhood holy places to check whether they have any evangelist projects in ruined territories all throughout the planet. Private essential and auxiliary schools are additionally a possibility for undesirable however feasible titles. Maybe you can have a go at selling things through Better World Books, Amazon, eBay, and so forth? Do know that magnanimous and revenue driven associations can be specific about what they will acknowledge. Add to that the blame you may feel about giving/selling things that are appallingly dated or in any case unmitigatedly bothersome. On the off chance that you dumpster them, dumpster jumpers and additionally blabbermouths will constantly report about the entirely great books the library is discarding, which may have been subsidized by citizen dollars. Taking care of books and putting them at the control can likewise demonstrate excessively shining. As far as I can tell, boxes were definitely torn open after library hours and scavenged through. I attempted pipe taping the containers shut and afterward putting the crates in trash containers to camouflage them as refuse, yet not even those actions could deflect the crazy bookworms (maybe bibliohoarders or bibliopolice would be a more able term). This sort of action can spike the bookkeeper secrecy operations. Spot the containers out at the control under front of murkiness, or show up grinding away pre-day break and put them out not long before junk pickup. It's stunning we need to go to such lengths. In all honesty, I once had an associate who took the library disposes of home and consumed them in her outside heater trying to stay away from abuse. What's more, bookkeepers are the ones who generally go against book consuming! Huge sets are particularly grave. I once parted with a vintage ""Oxford English Dictionary"" set to a nearby pitiful stylish home creator and she transformed it into a side table for a customer (I'm actually kicking myself for not getting a photograph of that!). Districts will regularly just acknowledge soft cover books for reusing. So I likewise enrolled the assistance of the library groundskeeper to make a total Contemporary Authors set ""disappear"" by cutting the hardcovers off with his table saw and reusing the pages. In any case, nothing more will be tolerated! We never consented to stockroom things that nobody needs. What's more, it's depleting attempting to conceal the scandalous little tidbit that libraries consistently deaccession and frequently discard books. Maybe I'm in the minority, however I totally love weeding. Nonetheless, I totally disdain stopping up landfills with stuff that is generally reusable or recyclable. Family Donating_1332264656All giggling aside, we should find some kind of harmony. We need to invite benevolent people who wish to give their own assortments for our raising support endeavors. What's more, we additionally esteem the individuals from our local area who give the most consideration to us (and what goes into our dumpsters). Our greatest bosses can likewise be our harshest pundits. Regarding selling library disposes of in book deals, you can likewise confront push-back, particularly when costly things are selling for just a quarter. We play our part of data steward truly. Straightforwardness is vital. Be impending about the thing you are doing and why. Staying aware of your weeding undertakings will likewise forestall the enormous deaccessioning occupations that stir doubt. I thought that it was ideal to not ""piecemeal"" the cycle and essentially make disposed of books free for the taking. What's more, in the event that anybody addressed it, I just said, ""Your duty dollars paid for these, presently we're giving them back to you."" In one of my last positions, we would take a great many trucks of materials that had been weeded, fold them into our book deal territory with a ""FREE"" sign, and the greater part of them would vanish inside a couple of days. We'd love to hear any entertaining (or not all that interesting) stories you'd prefer to share about exploring the universe of undesirable books!As librarians, we all know on a base level that were making a difference, that our work is important. But too often, we lose sight of the key moments that fill us with joy, each true connection quickly overshadowed by the next project on our list.Our librarians are excited to share the personal memories they turn to for that extra boost of inspiration.There have been so many over the several decades that Ive worked as a librarian. Here is one of the most recent.A couple of weeks before this writing, as we were leaving our church after the service, I heard someone shouting, Mrs. Kan! Mrs. Kan! I turned, and a tall boy came running down the path from the building. He was one of my former students when I was a school librarian. I hadnt seen him since May 2019. He was one of the quiet ones, always drawing, borrowing books, not saying much. I always looked out for him, to make sure he was feeling comfortable and that he was always welcome in the library. That Sunday he told me how much he missed me, and the library. Then he proudly told me, I can drive now!"
Nostalgia,"When the library closed the owner went and walked upstairs to her apartment. Yawning tiredly from all the work shed had all day. Not many people came by but keeping a library required cleaning and organizing the books, taking care of them, and replacing damaged ones. She smiled when she had heard walking downstairs, used to all the things that would come out at night. Shed grown so used to them, after running the library for a year. In fact, she looked forward to after hours. The steps on the stairs quickened as a young man dressed nicely, walked towards her, You wont believe what happened. He grinned sitting down at the table as a child, I fought a dragon today, you should have seen it Lirit. Lirit raised a brow, But there are no dragons in your book. He nodded in agreement, I know, so I went in another book, and it was seriously so fun! I cant wait to face of against a with now. he rattled on while she kept up a facade of happiness. In reality, she was worried, a big rule when she decided to take this apartment in exchange for running the library was that books were strictly not supposed to be mixed. They were supposed to keep their order. Lirit must not meddle even if the order is ruined, she can only give recommendations. But if the rules were broken beyond return, shed leave. So when he finished talking she calmly sat down across from him, You know this isnt supposed to happen. He frowned, and his face turned away to look down, But my books boring. She grabbed his hand from across the table, You have a good life, and you can always come out and read all the books you want, we can play anything you'd like even but going into other books is strictly off-limits. He frowned, even more, his eyes tearing up, I hate this. Its like a prison, and I cant decide if I hate or like the guard. She felt hurt at this, not knowing what to say. Standing up and walking away to the kitchen, I only say the rules and follow them, if you cant follow them I cant stop you. She took a deep breath, Ill just leave. He stood up after her, No you cant leave. Lirit chuckled at him, Thats not for you to decide. I have my own rules to follow, and thats the way things go. The young mans frown turned to a scowl in anger, Why do you follow them?! Theyre stupid, their unnecessary! Ugh! He turned and ran down the stairs, cursing out loud. She sighed, hed act like a child when happy and throw a tantrum like one when angry. He might have looked all grown up yet acted half his age. She knew her words hurt him, she knew he wasnt one to take no, but she couldnt help worry. She was concerned over how much longer she could stay here, how much longer she could speak to her favorite book characters. This was her dream come true, a place where magic exists, and she could stay here just by taking care of the library. But shed been told that many have already failed at working here. They've all had to leave, and shed only spoken to a hand full of them. They were all such empty people, shells walking around. And when taking into account how they were before working here, she realized theyd all changed. Theyd all been such bubbly people. She walked into the bathroom looking at herself in the mirror and frowning, she had been such a much happier person before coming here. But felt like all her happiness had been drained away, only feeling happy when she could hear him talk about all his new adventures. Another figure walking up and standing behind her, their reflection in the mirror looking at her in pity, Why don't you leave? Its not like youre not allowed to. She laughed, leave? And go where? I have nothing outside of here, Im a college dropout, neck high in dept, and shunned by my parents. Guess stepdad got to have his perfect family. The older lady sighed at the poor girl, But you wont lose all sense of emotions. Another start, you can do it. Lirit shook her head, I know I can, I can leave any time, I just dont want to. Its so much better, to just feel numb. I spent years loving you all, you made me feel at home, you took me away from all the hardship I lived. So if I can repay the feeling, I think I should. She smiled, letting out a broken laugh, Id wish you were my mom so many times because you wouldnt have turned your back on me. You would have stayed, you would have helped, and Id be happy, so much happy so if I can make you feel happy, I think I should. Lirit turned around, smiling at the older woman. The woman shook her head, Stop thinking like that. Stop saying that! You want me happy then leave, make a life for yourself! Feel something! Lirits eyes welled up with tears unable to react correctly as she laughed slightly, But youd disappear again! Youd just be the book character! You wont remember me! You wont care anymore. The woman pressed her hands against Lirits cheeks, You need help! And I cant give it to you please, please Im begging you. Call your friends, go out once a week at least, dont stay here! Dont stay dont stay. But the girl couldnt hear her, she just pressed her own hand against the womans, and smiled, Im so happy I got to see you here, Im so lucky. STOP IT. She cried and shook the girl by her shoulders, Stop it. She croaked, her voice breaking, Please please. And as she continued to beg, a chain wrapped around her neck, and began pulling her back, staring slow and having her pull Lirit along, when reaching the stairs the older woman finally let go. Thats because it was morning, all book characters would be taken back, even if they didnt want to. And if they went into a different book, then that book would tamper. But seeing the woman completely get pulled into the book would always hurt no matter the character. Lirit walked to the book and grabbed it, opening it up, and feeling nostalgic. This was a book she first read years ago, a book that had helped her get through high school, the little adventures of a teenager with their single mom. She set it back on its spot caressing the next book, and then the next, and the next. Most of the books in this library she had read, but only a handful had a personal connection to her. One she couldnt imagine her life without. Lirit sighed, the library would open again in just an hour or two, and had still not picked up on any sleep. She pushed herself up the stairs and laid down on the bed to sleep awhile. Waking up in time to open up the library. Having yet another slow and boring day. Once again as soon as the library was closed she walked up the stairs and decided to sit on the sofa. Hearing as steps came up the stairs, she didnt bother turning to look at who it was. Heard what happened last night. A gentle voice of a man spoke. Just as he walked up to her, sitting gently down beside her. Lirit smiled, Everythings fine, just a small disagreement. He chuckled, smiled at her, and nudged her arm, You know thats not how it is we worry about you Lirit, we care about you just as much if not more than what you do us She held her head down while he spoke, I know. Then why do you think just because youre not here well forget? he waited for a reply but when not hearing it he grabbed her hand gently, Well always be here, well always remember, and you can be sure of that. As she began shaking her head the man got up and kneeled in front of her, Lirit, please please look out for yourself, I care, we all care. We all want to share experiences, we all want to share our happiness but you can only feel so much from a piece of paper sometimes the warmth of someone else is necessary. Lirit huffed and shook her head, I dont need them! I dont, I like being here, I feel so much better being here if people out there were half as loving as you my stepfather wouldnt have taken my mom. He fell quiet, and pulled her into a hug, rubbing her back, Im sorry Im sorry. Shed eventually pull back, and rub her eyes before placing a smile on her face. She stood up and walked to her room, Im really tired today Ill see you tomorrow. His steps were heard leaving to the downstairs as an almost rhythmic set of others came upstairs. Almost like a melody as they tapped in the floor, the door of her room creaking open, and shattering the melody. A very young girl sitting beside Lirit, Whens the last time you talked with your mom? She asked, I haven't been with mine in years, I know how you feel, I know youre lonely even if we all just stood around you and talked youre just so lonely. Lirit didnt move from her spot on the bed, Im just fine right here. Thats not true didnt you wanna be like me? Didnt you want to travel the world like me, be free like me?... Why do you keep yourself locked up in here then? Lirit pulled herself up, sitting on the bed, I read books every single day, I talk to you guys every single day it makes me happy. It makes you empty. She said, and glared at her, How long till youre forced to leave what then? Ill manage, Lirit said. Youll become empty. The girl grabbed her hand and stared her down, ... Im not just a book character anymore cant you see that? Cant it please make a difference? She nodded back at the girl, Lirits eyes almost glimmering, Of course it makes a difference, Im not alone anymore. But staying here wont help you!... maybe you will have to be alone a little while! But youll do great I know you will- Lirit pulled her hand away while the girl spoke, What? I know the consequences its alright Im happy. Lirit said, I know you dont all like following the rules, but maybe if I can follow them, I wont have to ever leave. The girl sighed deeply, she looked at Lirit and patted her head, I cant change your mind she got up and opened the door to leave, looking back at Lirit a second more before walking out. Lirit frowned, everyone had come to talk to her about leaving, yet couldnt understand all she wanted was to stay. She thought they were sick of her, and couldnt see how evident their worry was. She grabbed her phone from her nightstand, seeing the time was just past two am. Lirit just wanted to sleep right now, she didnt want to think about what everyone was saying, because she couldnt understand how they couldnt see she had nothing to do outside this place. After taking in this job she had no reason to beg her mother for help, no reason to go to their house and get screamed at. Here she was free to live her life, even if all she did was live a fairy tail even if it would just last a couple more weeks, shed gladly enjoy them. Because of the characters that made her life just a little less miserable. The ones that made her want to reach for the stars and make a family of her own the ones that gave her the courage to leave a toxic environment. She'd stay if just for another day."
Henry Can Help,"Darla, my roommate Mary struts to the living room of our suite where I am sitting, studying for my final that is coming up. She holds up a novel that I had finished a week or two ago. This was due 	I look straight up at her losing my train of thought. Last week? I say indigenously. No way it could be overdue, I remember turning in books I let my sentence trail off as I try to remember how many books I turned in.	Dar- you what that return policy is like, you have to go. Now. Mary was right. At our university, the return policy was super strict. If the school found out how late my book was, there would be consequences. They might not even let me take my final, and I needed to complete this class for graduation. I started sweating.	I have to return this book! I jumped up and began pacing. How can I do it with no punishments, Mary? What am I going to do? I started to put on my shoes and grab my coat.	Let me think, let me think. Mary put her index finger to her chin. She knew how important this was to me. Then, her middle finger shot in the air. Henry! Henry works the late shift and he will understand. He would probably help you sneak it back in. But Dar, the library closes at midnight.	I glance at my watch. It reads 12:55. I have five minutes to run to the other side of campus and return the novel I had borrowed. I grab the book and my keys and start running.	Once outside in the cool crisp air, I inhale until my lungs are completely full. Grateful I wore my sneakers and not some showy sandals, I began to run. To try to make my journey go a little quicker, I take a sharp left turn and run onto the green.	The green is a big open grassy field that is very crowded in the summer. There will be picnics and study sessions for sure. I am halfway through to the other side when the sprinkler system goes off. In no time at all, I am soaked. My book! I wrap it under my coat to keep it safe and dry. With water in my eyes, I can barely see which way to run. I squint and look around until I find some sort of landmark and then begin running to it. Turns out, the landmark was a statue of a school mascot. That means, I am farther from the library than when I started out. I turn around and start sprinting.	I turn a corner and run right into a group of people. Who hangs out in the middle of the night in the cold like this?	Excuse me, excuse me, I try to get around them, but they are taking up the entire sidewalk. There are also a lot of them. 	Hey, I hear one mans voice draw the word out like syrup.	Yeah? I have no time for small talk; I have a book to return.	Where you headed? The man steps out from a shadow and I see that this isnt a man at all. Just a boy with a very manly voice. He is tall, thin, and very handsome. 	Library. I have to return this book, it's an 	How could it possibly be an emergency at this hour?I am beginning to get irritated with this odd group of people. The book is late.I watch something register in the boy's face and he turns to his small crowd. Make way! Make way! Shorty here has got a late book!	The group turns to look at me with shocked, but understanding faces. They clear a path that I am able to run right through. I yell thank you to all the people I pass, and in no time I am on my way again. 	I can finally see the giant library building sneering at me from afar. Clutching the stitch in my side. I stop to take a quick breather. I haven't run like this since high school track and even then I was not very fast. I look at my watch again. 12:58. I gasp and take off, clutching the book tightly in my hand.	I swipe my key so quickly that it does not work the first time, so I take my time trying again. Inside, I run to the back of the building where the elevators are. It is only three stories up, so it should not take long. I skid to a stop and begin jamming the up button. While I am pressing frantically, I glance up and notice a piece of paper taped to the elevator door.	Out of order? No! I cry. I turn on my heel and go to the nearest stairwell as fast as I can. I take the stairs two at a time and I am panting as I reach the top. I burst through the doors and bright light surrounds me. I see a blonde boy packing things into a backpack over at the desk.	Henry! I shout.	He looks at me and smiles warmly. No shouting in the library, Darla.	I hustle over to him briefly noting that the digital clock behind him reads 12:01. My heart sinks. Am I too late? Henry, I need your help.	I slide my novel (still in perfect condition) across the front desk. Henry takes it in his tanned hands and opens the front cover. His eyes look up at me through his shaggy hair. Darla	I lean in closer and whisper to him, even though we are the only ones in the library. Henry, please. You know how important it is for me to finish this class. This is the only thing holding me from graduating. I this. Mary said you could help.	I knew Henry would be able to help me if he wanted to. He was a computer genius and would have absolutely no problem changing a couple dates in the library system.	He takes a deep breath. I can help youIf you go on a date with me. His cheeks turn rosy and he gives me a sly half smile.	I slap my palm on the desk, a little louder than I intended. Done.	He looks at me in what can only be described as disbelief and now it is my turn to blush. Did I say the wrong thing? He tries to say something else and it comes out in stutters.	Darla- I I wasnt serious. I mean you dont have to! Is all Im saying. I mean I wouldnt mind- of course. But you don't have to	I steady my breathing to gain my composure. Henry Well go on a date. After my final. And after you return this book for me. I smile at him reassuringly.	He types for a quick minute and then shows me how the date has been changed. I let out a sigh of relief, and on my walk home, I feel light as air."
Pen and the Magic Library,"The winter wind breezed under my wings, the frozen earth a blur 800 feet below me, the boiled peach sun sat low on the evergreens far in the distance.Time to call it a day. I said to my travelling companions.Thank goodness!My wings are like jelly! replied Orval, the snowy owl on my right.I glanced surreptitiously to my left at Perky, the osprey.She was the smallest of us.The pretty bird of prey was doing a valiant job of not only keeping up, but not complaining either.I was impressed.Theres a farm down there, with a barn. Itll be warm and my feet are frozen. Said Orval. Complainer was his middle name.You know how I feel about arags homes.There will be cats, and dogs I shuddered, maybe even child arags with slingshots.Orval said, Well leave as soon as their rooster crows.They wont even know we were there,The thought of soft sweet-smelling hay in a cozy barn loft made me even more exhausted, my wings suddenly felt they weighed ten pounds each.Alright, lets check it out.Perky spiraled gracefully down towards the barn, light as a drifting leaf.The barn was an ominous maroon hulk in the remaining light of dusk.Perky carried a leather pack on her speckled back, just like my own but smaller.Orvals pack was oiled black canvas with his warlocks name engraved in a bronze nameplate.We followed Perky as she swooped soundlessly over the arags farmhouse.Orval whooted softly, the eerie cry of his ancestors slipping from his beak into the icy wind of our slipstream. Through the barn window we flew.I took off my pack, then helped Perky with hers. Thanks Pen. She said to me.Pen is the shortened version of Penrod.What a stuffy name, like that of an English butler.My parents had been messenger ravens.Of our entire aviary at the Younglocks Academy, only Orval called me Penrod, when pushing my buttons.Orval took off his canvas pack and placed it under the window, staking claim to the sleeping spot with the best view.Fine by me. I was a raven.Although my ancestors hailed from the Canadian province of Newfoundland, I personally preferred warmer climates.Orval was from Greenland and excelled in frosty weather.I thought your feet were frozen. I teased him.They are, he replied, But I didnt say it bothered me.Why do you have to be so difficult? I sighed.I just like getting my wayso do youOh, hush up you two. Scolded Perky, Lets enjoy our rest.She laid her pack down next to mine and I smiled.Youre right Perks.Sorry to egg him on, I guess Im a little grouchy.Perky turned to her pack, wiggling her beautiful striped tail feathers in the air as she rummaged around. Here she said, and tossed me a rabbit head with the eyes still intact. I saved this for you.At that moment I knew I truly loved her.Theres plenty of mice here.Cooed a smokey feminine voice from the shadows above our heads.Blimey. Orval whispered, as cupids arrow pierced his butt.She was a creamy white barn owl, with pale caramel spots in all the right places.Her heart shaped face framed beautiful, dreamy brown eyes.Cmon she said to Orval, Ill show you where the mice come to dance in the moonlight. Their last tango andshe chuckled like a bamboo windchime.Tongue-tied, Orval puffed up his snowy white feathers and went with her.Do you miss your bondling? Perky asked me.Yes, I do.He is a kind lad.His magic skills astound the teachers. Even though they dont let on.How do you know this?UmwellI didnt want her to think less of me this early into our getting-to-know-each-other-better stage.Its okay, she laughed, I spy on the teachers too.Yes, it is unethical.And yes, my bondling would get into huge trouble if I was caught.But I learn so much about them.And their magic. I would never use anything I overheard to help my bondling at his tests.Me too. I said, relieved.That would be cheating.Ive only spied on the masters twice.I think they knew I was there, high on the shelf just under the eave by the window.Its likeone of their tests.You know, to test my morals or something.Yes! I exclaimed, Ive gotten that feeling too!We were silent a couple of minutes.From the direction of the woods, we heard the shrill scream of a mouse.My mouth watered.Perky flew up to the windowsill.I joined her there and tentatively put a wing over her downy soft shoulders.She laid her head on my wing. Father Moon was a cold white spotlight, big as a whales eye, creeping to take its rightful place of authority over the night.How much farther? she asked.I said, One more long day of travel, by nightfall well be at Castle Nightwalker. Well make the midnight deadline no problem.This will be my first trip. Her voice excited and breathy.Ill have made the trip five times.I wasnt boastful, but still I hoped it impressed her a bit. Cmon, lets get some sleep. I changed the subject.We laid in the feathery soft hay with our heads on our packs.The second I was horizontal, my eyelids came down, as heavy as a portcullis.At dawn the arags rooster crowed.The three of us sprang up as if dowsed with an icy water bucket.Orval yawned, stretched his legs and popped his toes.A nasty habit like nails on a slate.But I saw that hed brought us all a breakfast of beheaded mice. I picked up my small bloody furball and raised a brow to the owl.What? he said, You know I love brains the best.I thanked him and ate half the mouse, I put the other half in my pack for later.Perky did the same.Although we were far from sated, a full belly would only slow us down. We had a deadline after all.We hefted our packs and strapped them on tight.I hopped to the windowsill and stretched my wings wide.The world was awakening behind its indigo shroud.A sliver of lilac hoovered in the east; it would be another hour before Mother Sun would awaken.I felt refreshed.My wings felt light as helium, and powerful.I leapt from the sill and soared down to the ground like a glider.I heard Perky gasp behind me. I beat a downward stroke and soared with great speed up towards the tops of the cedar trees.Orval positioned himself to my right, Perky once again to my left.Her leather satchel, though smaller than mine, looked big for her delicate frame, I felt a pang of worry for her.Orval seemed on cloud nine.Hed shrugged off his late night of little sleep like a heavy woolen cloak.So. I started, leading him.What? he asked, feigning innocence.Oh please.You are dying to tell me.Cmon, spit it out.He exhaled like a popped cork and exclaimed, Im in love!Her name is Starry.Shes the most exquisite creature Ive ever met! Im going to marry that owl someday.Woah, you sound serious.I am, my friend, shes the one.We chatted as we flew on.At noon the jagged mountains of Othreal loomed in the distance ahead.They were still 120 miles away.Beyond them, our destination.We soared high, appreciating our awesome perspective.Skeletal maples, like naked old ladies, reached leafless limbs to us as if begging for alms.Damp green pines devoid of squirrels, rocked in slow motion with the wind.As we flew over a meadow, we spotted sparks like tiny beacons- the cellophane of grasshoppers wings glinting in the sunlight!I swooped low through the tall grass to catch the little snacks in my beak.By 4:30 the sun was bloated and heavy again, sinking like a balloon the day after a shindig.I looked over at Perky and could see she was struggling.I said, Lets find shelter.Perky looked at me gratefully but Orval said, We could go another hour.The castle is only another 60 miles or so.But I insisted, We have plenty of time.We can stop now, then hit the sky first thing.Well get to the castle by four.Thats plenty of time to deposit the books before the deadline.He was about to argue further but caught the look in my eye accompanied by a slight head nod towards Perky.He was a pain, but he was perceptive.Okay Pen.Well stop for the day, as long as its in another barn.My inky black feathers bristled, but I kept my beak shut.Perky said, Theres a village coming up, just before the foothills.We slowed our speed, scanning the acres for a suitable safe place.Dusk still an hour away.I was nervous as a flea on a soapy cat.There were arags all over the place, finishing up their chores and getting ready for their evening meal.Dogs were running amok.Cats were stalking things in bristling brown grass.All my alarms were sounding.Look, there, the white fence, the yellow house. Said Orval, They have a good one.The barn was once green, but pretty much wearing its grey birthday suit now. However, it looked clean and well kept.Perky flew to the high little window, only hesitated a second, then flew inside.I followed her, Orval right behind me.Aaaaahhhh sighed Perky as she unburdened her back from her pack.She flopped down upon the hay as I took off my own pack.Orval said, Id better wait until dark before hunting.Too many arags out there.I gave commentary from the windowsill.I can see Mom putting food on the table.Shes just put a pie outside the window to cool.Now they are praying.I continued watching the family of four- a mom, a dad, and two young boys- as theywent about their nightly meal ritual.As darkness fell, the moon rose to take its place in the star-studded sky.Its brilliant light created deep night shadows on everything below our window.Father Moon was growing fat, tomorrow hed be full.Orval swooped down off the loft and flew out the wide-open doors of the barn. Perky hopped onto the weathered sill next to me.She asked, Why do we give the books back every year?Cant we keep copies at Younglocks?The books our bondlings borrow are all original versions, illuminated with detailed artwork. Theyve been collected by Etherbain Nightwalker, the greatest sorcerer of all time. Hes collected them for the last 950 years.Each book is about different sorts of spells, each one contains its own magic, thats why they cant be copied. And thats why we return them every year.Wow.Ive never felt so important. she said with awe.We .I continued, Young warlocks in training, all over the world, send their bondlings to Nightwalker for the books in his library.The light went out in the kitchen of the yellow farmhouse.Perky dove out the window before I could stop her.She was so beautiful as she glided across the yard!Her shadow sailed over a one wheeled haycart propped up on blocks, a three sided grass green shed, and a table with rusty gardening tools: a trowel, a small hoe, and a pair of rusty shears.Her silken cream feathers ruffled in the breeze as she headed for the kitchen window.Shes going for the pie! I thought with horror.Perky landed next to the pie.A large shadow with pointed ears leapt out from under the shelf!It barked insanely! Perky pressed against the side of the house and froze as the window suddenly brightened. She hooked the edge of the pie with her talon and dumped it onto the dogs head.The pie must have still been hot inside because the shaggy beast howled in surprise.It shook its head and hunks of berry pie flew from its muzzle.Perky snatched a couple of pieces from the ground while the blinded dog pawed its eyes.She was just about to take to the air-when I clearly heard the sickening THWAP!Gotcha! it was one of the young arags, eight or nine years old, the spent rubber band of his slingshot wriggling like a worm as he ran over to his prey.Perky was stunned.As she struggled to her feet I flew to her as swiftly as I could.I swooped with my talons outstretched towards the cruel boys eyes.Then I saw the second boy, a slightly bigger replicant of the first.He pulled his arm backI veered off to the right just as the boy let go with his rock.THWAP!OWWWW! You hit me Bran! Screamed the first young arag to the second.I didnt mean to!Honest!The younger boy was crying and holding his head.He would have a mighty lump over his right ear for days.His older brother scooped up Perky who tried her darndest to bite him with her wicked sharp beak.He firmly held the poor osprey out to his little brother and said, Look Ever, youve got yourself a bird!Shes a real beauty all right!The young boys sniffling petered out.He looked up and grinned at the bird.Gimme! he cried with hands outstretched like pale starfish.Here, hold her like this. And Bran showed Ever how to avoid getting nipped.Lets make a cage from that old apple crate in the barn, said Bran, We can nail chicken wire to the lid for a door.The excited boys grabbed lanterns from the shed on their way to the barn.I flew up to the loft and watched in horror as they caged my love.Orval came, dropped a couple of beheaded field mice at my feet and asked, Whats wrong? What happenedwheres Perky?Shhhh, I said and pointed down through the hatch.Orval saw what was happening, his bloody beak hung open like a wound.The cage door was securely latched.The chattering boys left.They took the lanterns with them and the dark was welcome.We flew down to the cage.Hi Pen.Hi Orval. Perkys voice cracked as she winced in pain.Well get you out of there, I promise. Said I.I went back out to the table in the yard, grabbed the garden shears, and brought them to Perkys cage.Okay Orv, get your claws under the door.A keening sound escaped him as he pried up the lid with all his strength.When the door lifted a half inch, I jammed the shears into the opening.Then both of us jumped from the top of the crate onto the handle of the shears.The door popped up six more inches!Perky was weak but squeezed through the opening.She cried out in pain when she landed.Her left wing was broken.Just then the rickety kitchen door slammed shut.The footsteps on the dirt path thudded rapidly- boys running!Theyre coming back!Weve got to get up to the loft! I shouted.Get on my back! said Orval.Perky did and he flew her to safety.I followed on their heels. The barn filled with lantern light.Gone! cried Ever.Its your fault!You didnt close the door good enough!We three birds huddled in the hay, holding our breath, not even daring to peek.WHAP!Hey!Its not my fault, I closed the lid super good! Bran said indignantly.Did not Loser! Ever whined.Heydid you bring garden shears out here?Noooooo replied Ever, Mom doesnt like us playing with them.Cmon Ever! said Bran excitedly, Lets go find us your bird thief!Bring those shears!The boys and the light ran off.I looked out the loft window and saw their shadows chasing them down the dirt path.Orval sighed with relief, That was close.I inspected Perkys broken wing and said, Now what?Theres no way Im leaving her here.Orval said, Theres no way she can fly with us.If we wait for her wing to heal, well miss our deadline and our bondlings will have no new magic book for a whole year.Then I asked Orval, What book are you returning?Its a book about frog spells, like how to turn arags into them and stuff.I said, That wont help.Neither will mine, its about love potions.We looked at Perky in unison and said, Well?Healing spells! she cried hopefully.I raced to her pack and upended it, spilling its contents out onto the hay.I picked up her book, turned it over, and read the title out loud, Healing Spells 101.This is fantastic! I cried with renewed hope.I flew down to the yellow house, the light was still on in the kitchen so I could see the scene of the attack well.I spotted the small sharp rock rusted with the boys blood and a few strands of his hair. I brought it back to the loft along with some of the pie the dog had wiped from its teary eyes and an old kerchief used as a cleanup rag.Orval brought back the rest of the stuff we needed from the woods- leafy mugwort and mud rich with minerals.As I mixed the components together, I spoke the ancient words from the book. Orval did the same as he helped me pack themixture onto Perkys wing.In silence we wrapped the wing and fashioned a sling with the kerchief.It doesnt hurt so much anymore, Perky said as we readied for sleep.Dawn came with mist creeping over the low hills like the wispy grey fluff of heron chicks.I sat on the windowsill, waiting for my companions to wake.The fog lent an ominous cast to the break of our day, it was a bad omen.It turns out I was anxious for nothing.Perky flew up to the windowsill and sat next to me, laughing.Then she flew from the sill and loop-dee-looped up into the grey sky.I then saw the fog as not bleak but soothing.Funny how love can change your outlook.Orval got up.He cracked his toe knuckles.The three of us packed our library books and headed to Nightwalker Castle."
Sweet Immersion,"I don't mind my job, it's a job and it pays the bills, I work hard. Stretching before pulling the vacuum, I am starting with the aisles, humming gospel while I work to distract myself. An hour has passed, one more before I get my break, I will have my tea in the lounge with the security guard, Jamail. Now there's a reason to work here. His beautiful dark eyes intense with longing, his strong muscular arms wanting to hold me. We are lovers. We met immediately took a liking to each other when I started work here. This little library with its old structured building charm, and slowly we became more than friends.""Hi sweets, so far so good? Nothing going on for me, the usual. I put in for my vacation week coming up next month."" He announced, as I sat down with my mug of tea. I opened a pack of crackers. I eyed him narrowly, he hadnt mentioned anything to me before this.""Oh, I didnt know you were going to be off for a week?"" I queried, I didnt want to sound like he owed me anything, but I was disappointed, my voice cracked a little.""I have to take it or I don't get paid, company policies."" He took a deep swig of his coffee. Black with sugar. I tap my tea mug, not sure what to say next without sounding pissed. Then it was time to get back to work. I start dusting the shelves, spraying the rag with cleaner spray stuff, lemon scented. 'So, he's going to be off a week, hmphh, he could have mentioned it to me or asked me to be with him.' My mind racing now with anxiety. Ok, calm down, it's his life, if he doesnt want to be with you that's his choice. I finish dusting the aisles and then it's time for supper. Again we are alone. The library quiet with the sounds of nothing permeating through void. I sullenly go back to the lunch room to have dinner. He came in behind me, so handsome in his uniform, and he plants a kiss on my lips. I smiled, but we still had unfinished things to discuss.""What are you going to do when your off""? My voice rises to a sarcastic tone. He looks at me with raised eyebrows, surprised at my question.""You're not thinking anything are you?""""Like what do you want me to think? You never mentioned you were going to be off for a week and you have not asked me to join you. It's your business anyway."" I replied, the tension building between us, he looked nervous now, shifting in his seat at the table.""It just came up, I havent even filled out the forms yet, but would you be able to join me on a week holiday?"" He asked.""Well, I would hope your not asking me because you think I am upset or anything?"" I wouldnt add more to save face. I didnt want to act insecure, but I was. I don't have to spill out the story here, we know where it will end.""Of course not, you know I adore you, we have been seeing each other for 3 months, I would love it if you joined me, we could relax and do things together like go to the movies, or have a picnic. Would you enjoy a picnic?"" He rubbed his chin, elbows on the table, as he leaned towards me as if he wanted to crawl onto the surface to kiss me. My heart melted at the thought, how could I say no.""I will have to ask my supervisor. I am not sure if I have leave left."" I told him in all honesty. And then we had to get back to work to finish the night, in the empty halls, while he sat at the front to guard the doorway.*********. He had taken me to a pizza place, so cozy with candles on the red and white checkered tablecloths. My heart was melting as we ate. We got to know each other. We two peas in a pod, like honey bees to flowers, it was meant to be. He was Jamaican/American, half white. I was Puerto Rican, my family having immigrated here 20 years before, for a better life. There was no money for college, I wasnt really interested in a degree, I chose to work first for awhile and save up. Jamail was taking correspondence courses and working as a security guard, he wanted to join the police force here, he wanted to make the world a better place he'd always said. He had a harder life on the island than I did, but then maybe that is what made us so bonded, we both grew up poor, and on tropical islands.													*****Hopefully this conflict of being able to take time off together would be okay and we would have a wonderful week together. I was already happy thinking about it. I still had to talk to the boss.""Yes Joanie, how can I help you?"" Leanna had her nose in paperwork, she was staying late that night to finish up her backlog. I had actually arrived early to be able to ask her about the vacation time, I was nervous. She wasn't one of my favorite people at the library to deal with.""I was wondering, would it be possible to have a week off next month? I am not sure if I have vacation time."" I just got right to the point, my voice nervous.""Oh, um, I will have to check with personell, I can let you know, if you dont have paid time do u want it anyway, and we need a replacement for the week."" She said, flipping papers under her long manicured red nails. Nails to scratch your eyes out, I worried.""I would hope to have a paid week off, but if not I would settle for a week without pay."" I replied.""Your dating that security guard are you not?"" Leanne chewed out.""Um is that asking personal like or is it not allowed?"" I asked back. I wondered what she was implying.""As long as it doesnt interfere with his work or yours, I dont see an issue."" Leanne smiled at me. I breathed in relief.""You're a good worker Maria. I would hate to lose you."" And with that, she got up and got ready to go home, the night would be ours, mine and Jemail's. I watched Leanne leave, as she grabbed her briefcase, her presence still around even when she wasnt, she was one of those women that left an aura like a cat left a scent. I would get that holiday, I thought, and I went to begin my night shift at the library...."
Oak Tree,"Once an insignificant acorn, the large oak tree grew its fragile roots deep into the fertile soil. A passing deer was chased away by a far away noise as the sapling enjoyed the fresh meadow air. On that spot the growing tree sprouted into the sky year by year. Its adolescent branches extended out becoming a home for all species of native birds and squirrels. Its trunk swelled to the official width of 48.9 inches around its dark trunk. A tree that would change a small frontier town forever.  The citizensof Love-an-Oak prizedhaving the tree on the outskirts of townin their undeveloped meadow. This tree was their towns treasure. So much that the founders named their town in its honor. Atraveling real estate agent hadonce discussed building a much needed school in the spot of the tree. The townsfolk railroaded her out of townwith all but pitchforks and torches.It was then that the town charter officially recognized the trees community value. First,the Grand Tree Calendar was established. The calendar laid out special events for people to honor the tree. A Tyler of the Tree was officially established. This person was charged with the general protection of the tree and surrounding land. A Doctor of the Tree was put into office to make sure that their friend was always in the best of health. The town created a rule that established that no visitor would go to the tree without at least 2 townsfolk present.The charter promoted an incentive for creating paintings of a flattering kind. The paintings were encouraged to be added to the Tree For Life Museum.  Every Arbor Day, locals would gather around the tree out of public respect. The town's tree doctor would evaluate the tree as part of the ceremony in the morning of their celebration. A private, thorough inspection would take place 72 hours before the holiday event. The doctor would give the 74 footgiant an examination,alwaysindicating no significant issues. The people in the town would cheer at the report of the tree's pristine health. The tree doctorwould be treated to the honors of a king for the rest of the day.On this commemorative day, a special event would take place. The Tyler of the Tree would walk around the tree in the morning with a ceremonial, flintlock rifle. Every half an hour another person would eagerly join the procession. The process would continue for 7 hours and 4 minutes with supporters at a table offering food and water to the volunteers. Those walked more than six hours received a commemorative medal. Many families had rows of medals with fond memories attached to them. The tree was a celebrated event in any manner the townsfolk could find a way to pay homage to their source of pride. When summer began the transition into fall, local children would gather with the town Mayor on the last Saturday of summer to see if anyone could find the first changed leaf. The children who managed to find the correct leaves would win a basket of candy.  Young lovers were known to meet at the tree to solidify their relationships. The tree became an integral part of many engagement stories throughout the town. The lives of those engaged would be connected in marriage under its branches. The newlyweds would be told that when they were ready to make a family, that their consummation in the same place on a moonless night would guarantee their good fortune witha pregnancy. For that reason, the tree was left alone on moonless nights so as to give any wanting couple their privacy. A large green flag would be temporarily planted near the tree to let others know that the space was temporarily occupied. Some couples chose to birth their children in that same spot, making a full circle of their family. The babies were known as tree babies. If the couple dated, married, consummated and birthed under the tree, they and their new family would have the honor of being called Ones of the Oak or Oakies for short. The family would receive a plaque on Arbor Day and would be added to the sacred Book of the Tree.  Young children had stories read to them on blankets under the tree. School aged children would be brought to the branch canopyon warm days to learn about the wonders of nature. Older children were warned under penalty of consequences from desecrating the tree's integrity in any manner. Achild stucka knife into the trunkon an obscene dare. The Tyler of the Tree found the knife. Sheralliedthe townsfolklike a swarm of bees investigating an intruderin the hive. The boy had forgotten hismonogrammedknife sheath on a nearby rock, immediately implicating him. The child and family became local pariahs, eventuallybeing forced toleavethe town.  A cemetery was constructed overlooking the tree not long after the founding of the town. Those on their deathbeds were comforted that they would soon rest in a place close to their beloved oak. It was common that the family of the deceased would gather at the foot of the tree after the funeral. When family came to visit the grave site, they, too, would find peace knowing the tree was in eyesight. Some families chose to pour the ashes of the deceased outside the perimeter of the branches. Townsfolk were asked to keep from the tree for three days out of respect. Eventually a flourishing, botanical garden was created in sight of their beloved. It was said behind closed doors that the tree would glow once a year. One needed to stand just beyond the poinsettias and look at the trunk on the last sunset of Spring. This became known as the Poinsettia Prophecy. People reported feeling a renewed sense of motivation after being witness to the event.Many of the those from the town celebrated the trees impact on their personal lives with a tattoo. Townspeople were proud to show off their ink to one another after their completion. Every three years, those who adorned their bodies would gather at the trees base for a group picture. The photos would be placed along the Wall of Memories in the local museum.  The once tiny acorn had become a great oak tree. Thisallowed a town to rally around something simple and elegant for their communal happiness. The relationship was the purest of symbiotic interactions. A reason for the town to establish its own roots deep into the ground."
Dangerous books,"I thought Jason was mad. But I was wrong. I was mad! Mad to get imprisoned in this library. It started like this...TRING! TRING! TRING!My phone was ringing! With sleepy eyes, I turned back and took a look at the clock. Damn! It was 11 PM! I attended the call.The voice shouted, ""Hey, it's me, Jason.""""Why did you call now?"" I asked him sleepily. He answered, ""I have to submit the library book, Drake. Its due date is today.""""Are you mad? At 11 PM?""""Please, Drake."" And that sentence did something to me. ""Ok, I'll come to your house now.""""I'm standing in front of your house, Drake.""I hung up the call, put on my mask and slowly tiptoed on the stairs, hoping my parents won't wake up. I looked at their locked room and sprinted to Jason. He looked sober and his blue eyes glittered in the night. ""You look sleepy,"" he said.""Ah, at 11 PM everyone looks sleepy."" I gave him an annoyed look and he turned his face to the other side.""Ok. Chill."" He puts his strong forearms on my shoulder. Then only it hits! ""Jason, do you know what day is today?"" He thought for a while.""Aw, man! Magic day.""""Anything can happen to us. The roads, trees can behave weirdly and people have no guarantee of their life today.""We sat down and made a decision. ""We are going, whatever it takes,"" he said and stood up. I regretted being his friend!*****We started our dangerous journey, holding our hands together. ""Is submitting this book really necessary?"" I asked him, expecting a no as a reply.""Yes. I have to submit it today,"" he said, breaking all my hopes.Jason stopped me on my path. A whirlpool on the road! There were many whirlpools, all over the road.""Do you still think we should continue?"" I asked him.""We are submitting the book, for sure."" He stressed on the book a lot. We took our steps carefully and who would want to lose their lives for submitting a library book?His backpack slided and fell into a whirlpool!Jason would have jumped too but I caught hold of him.""NO,"" he shouted at the top of his voice. ""Idiot, it's just a backpack. Don't risk your life for it,"" I said, keeping him in my grip.  ""The book is in that backpack."" ""Calm down, Jason."" I patted his back. He was short tempered. The bag flew out from another whirlpool. I opened my mouth in awe. Whirlpools always suck in but this whirlpool threw it out. Jason ran to the bag. Man, he was relieved! As much short tempered, he loved having fun. He jumped into one whirlpool and came out of another. He signalled his hands to me. ""No thanks.""We continued our journey. The night was filled with wonders!This time, I stopped him on his path. The ground was cracked! There was no road in the middle! We carefully walked in the sides. We panted and took long breaths. Then we heard a siren! ""Police are standing there, Jason,"" I alerted him.""We should go to the library, we are almost there.""The library was in our sight. But the police stood between us and the library.""It's lock down today. We shouldn't come out at this hour of night,"" I stated the facts to him.""Look there!"" He shouted and I ducked.Stones were flying around the place. We ran and hid behind a tree. We had to plan an escape! Jason gave a wild grin to me. He signalled me to look down. The roots of the tree were loose in the ground. ""No, Jason. Don't do this.""He won't take my words into account if he decides what he wanted to do.He lifts the tree with his strong hands. I gave him a hand but it wasn't necessary for him. We took that tree as defence and slowly approached the library. We walked for a distance and the stones stopped coming our way. We planted the tree again and stood helpless behind the police jeep. Jason was clever and loved adventures. But he hated being late in anything and never gave up. I'm his only companion and he takes me everywhere, whether it's a problem or fun.Again, Jason gave me a wild grin. This time I was happy that he had an idea. He saw a whirlpool under the jeep. ""Drake, this is our only chance to escape the police and go into the library. Follow me,"" he said and slowly crawled near the whirlpool. I crawled after him. He fell into the whirlpool and I prayed to all gods to return home, safe and sound. I fell into the whirlpool and it was just for a second. I flew out of the other whirlpool near Jason. ""We did it,"" I said.""Yup, let's go in,"" he said and opened the large grilled gate of the library. We tiptoed into the flower bedded garden. We heard the sound of footsteps and hid behind a tree. We slowly peeped onto the other side. There were two people, a man and a woman in my sight. He was thin and had brown hair. The woman was fat and had black hair. Something hit me! The door of my parent's room was locked outside! I slowly went near them and touched the woman. She opened her mouth to shout. But the man shut her mouth with his hands. ""Mom! Dad! What are you doing here?"" I whispered.""We came to submit the book,"" my Dad whispered back. ""What's the hurry?"" I asked them.""Ask Jason,"" my Mom said as she saw Jason standing behind me. ""I'll tell you on the way, Drake,"" Jason said. The four of us marched to the stairs of the library. To my astonishment, there were hundreds of them waiting to submit the book. ""What's the hurry?"" I ask Jason again. ""I'll tell you.""My suspicion increased. I ran to a man standing in the row and asked him, ""What's the hurry to submit the book today?""""Look at the board at the starting of the stairs."" He pointed to a yellow coloured board.I rushed down and took a look at the board. It read, ""The books are behaving badly on Magic day. Please submit before 12AM.""I thought, ""What? The people have no sense. How can books behave badly?"" and laughed. ""You are fooled, Jason.""""Nope. The librarian never lies,"" he told.I looked at my watch. It was 12 AM. ""Let's see what happens,"" I mocked at him. The book in his hand suddenly flew in the air.""Why did you throw the book up, Jason?"" I asked. ""I didn't do that, Drake,"" he said slowly. That's when I truly believed the librarian. All the books jumped and hovered in the air.""SURRENDER,"" they shouted in unison. All the people were scared and ran haywire. The books chased everybody and covered them with paper. One by one, they made the people surrender. Jason and I stood frozen. ""Now do you understand why I wanted to submit it?"" he asked.""Yes,"" I replied, giving him a helpless look.We stood there and surrendered ourselves. *****I wouldn't have been imprisoned by these bunch of books if I had just been quiet and followed the people.Thanks for your amazing work, Mind of Drake!"
I Was Once a Tree,"I was once a young man not too much unlike yourself, and I thought the world open to me if only I could live long enough. I covered deserts and scaled mountains, trying to find the one thing that would extend my years.Did you find it?The old man grinned. What do you think?At last, only a few miles from the village from whence I came, I found an old spiritist who told me that she could make my life last for centuries if only I wished it and would give her all the knowledge I had gained in my travels. I agreed, of course, and after years of sharing my stories with her, she insisted that I choose the spot where the transformation would take place.When I regained consciousness, or the only form of consciousness I had, it was to a sky much larger than before, the ground much closer than before. The soil greeted me as an old friend. The wind caressed me as a lover. I strained to move and could feel myself perhaps, just a little, rising. My efforts were grains of sand in an ocean, and centuries passed before I realised the entirety my state.Those around me rose and fell, silent in their ascents, thundering in their deaths. Their limbs danced above me, and the breeze made music of their oft golden trappings. During their cycles, I grew larger, taller, stronger. No longer did the storm bend me nor the rain push me down. The bitter cold nipped, but I slept peacefully through it. Even in summer, it was an odd sort of consciousness that was half-aware, half-asleep. Things happened. I knew they did, but it was a distanced life around me. There was the soil, the sun, and the wind. People drifted around me, fading mirages, fleeting impressions. I do not remember them now, though they built houses on my limbs and made timber from my branches. The children gave their secrets willingly to me, lips pressed close to my bark as they offered what none else would receive. The young climbed my branches and kissed in the leaves. The old settled at my feet to weave tales that caused me to drift into endless slumbers of near-dreams. Then the woodcutter came.You died!I was old, and part of my life died that day he cut the legs off me. He took me from the steadying ground I had woven myself into. For a moment, I flew. Then there was my own thunder and the scraping, bruising journey from the forest. I do not remember what happened next. I suppose it was a type of rebirth, and as with regular birth, the events are too painful to recall. Clearer consciousness came to me then, and a darkness I would spend much time in. I journeyed across the lands without seeing much of it, and I could feel that I had left most of myself behind. A man who claimed many languages as his own carried me. His words were the sweetest honey, and he would etch the best of them onto me. I clung to them as a dragon its hoard, savored them as a child his treasures. He crafted medicine and pressed herbs, and I curved, I weighed those leaves and petals. The dust of desert turned to brine and then salt-stained air to crisp cold. His hand wavered, and the letters detoured and grew like wandering nomads till the ink splattered. I traced over his precious lines as time aged them, and none read them but me. Finally, thin fingers, coarse but blistered in all the right places, dusted my covers and gave breath to my pages. She placed me on a table, and I saw nothing but the bare rafters and her keen eyes, her quick hands, the quill she placed upon the blank pages and in the margins. I relished the words, the feel of wisdom etched onto my being. Winters were muted. Summers nigh unbearable, but she brought me to breathe every night.As the taut sheet of her face crinkled, little hands picked me up and turned me. They ran fingers along the ink and ripped pages and bent corners. I bore it. I could do little else. One face reappeared more often, and then I was journeying again to another small room every day where he would scribble portraits and single-phrase monologues around the prior columns and drawings. He gave me to another. She gave me to a third. Then a fourth and a fifth, and the count was lost to me as hands touched, sketched, licked, turned, dropped, hugged, lost, loved, forgot, stained. I was a masterpiece of time, of livelihoods and longings. I was a companion and an enemy and a helper. I was buried. Suffocation did not scare me, but rot ate my edges. Moisture soaked my pages. Winters brought silence. Death. It was a hibernation deeper than I had ever experienced. Summers were worse as my being died and fell as a lepers limbs. From dust I had come. To dust I longed to return. They dug me up, a group of gentlemen with beards and strong hands that built a camp that night and circled a fire. Once flames twisted towards upwards as Northern lights danced in dark skies, they tossed me in. The heat blistered my skin. An endless, horrified scream rose from my pages. My spine twisted. Excruciating pain curled my body inwards. Words left me.The pain stopped. There was silence.You died again?Yes. And no. I was cursed to live longer. I returned to a quiet state, a womb most pleasant. Warmth reached me, unfurling my fingers. I stretched for the sun. When I broke forth that spring, it was as a sapling from a descendant of the tree I had once been. I arose but much quicker than before, and I could move now. I could see. My branches turned to limbs, and my twigs formed fingers. One day, much the same as the others, I lifted my foot, and my roots fell away. Another decade passed as bark morphed to skin and leaves lengthened to hair. Then I was a man once more. I laughed and left the woods. Now I have returned. So, young man, I ask you. What am I?You told me already. I know what youve been.But what am I?The young man thought, and he thought. After much time had passed, he raised his head and spoke, You are an old man with a story to tell.The old man grinned. That is one answer.Is it the right one?He shrugged. I am a storyteller. The possibilities are endless."
Roots of Fire,"TW: burningThere stood a tree. An ordinary, sturdy oak tree. It shed its leaves every winter, and smiled at the pastel sunsets in summer with curved leaves that whispered to the wind in wise murmurs that only the oldest souls know of. It knew it was dying, that too many clouds had shadowed it with their smiles and anger, with their soft faces and their limbs of thunder and lightning that struck out at the tree. It stood tall and waved at the sky, saying farewell to the birds showering squirrels with leaves of copper and gold. It was ready to move on, it yearned for the freedom of death, but a deep, stubborn feeling told the tree that though death was close, the end of another unfinished story was closer. The tree sighed as thoughts began to bubble up from the depths of its memoryEden Stallard was 11 years old. He set his elbows on the dusty windowsill and stared out of his window at the spacious gardens and orchards his family owned. The green blades of grass stood up straight like soldiers, always perfectly trimmed and apple trees were full of snow-like blossoms that danced for an audience of daffodils and bluebells. The gardeners always made sure that not a petal was out of place. If he stretched up on his tiptoes, he could see the old oak tree that resided in a corner of the grounds, like a guardian, a protector that shielded the mansion from the outside world. The tree was very special, though Eden didnt know why. He spent hours talking to the dark trunk, and when he did, the leaves rustled and a warm breeze stroked his face. Sometimes, though perhaps just his imagination, he thought he could hear snatches of a low laugh dancing among the roots that poked the surface. Eden loved the tree, and he had asked his dad to build a treehouse for him. However, his father was a withdrawn figure who rarely had time for his children. It was likely he hadnt heard him, or even if he had, he had forgotten. So Eden had begun building it himself. Every afternoon, leaving his schoolwork untouched, he slipped out of his bedroom window and slid down the drainpipe. He had procured a set of gardeners clothes months before in order to sneak across the gardens unnoticed. It was impossible to see his hard work from the house, the branches and leaves were knitted far too closely together. Once, his sister Donna had caught hid creeping away. He had told her about the treehouse, and she had warned him against continuing to work on it. If their mother found out about is misdemeanours, she would worry about him even more than she already did. Donna was 14, and loved her brother, but couldnt bear to see the sadness and disappointment he caused their mother. He got into fights at school and argued with their father about his future. Mr Stallard, their father, wanted Eden to pursue a career in the business of making cider, a profession that was profitable and well respected. Eden, on the other hand, wanted to become a writer. He would dream up stories and doodle on his textbooks, looking at the symbols on the pages which meant little to him. His pencil was his sword, the paper his shield, his mind the home of battles, friendships and betrayals. He battled reality and the expectations of society with his vivid imagination. Today he would complete the tree house. He was determined to work until either he dropped dead or he finished, and he knew which was more likely. He was about to heave the window open when he heard his mothers voice calling him from the living room. He rolled his eyes and bounced down the stairs, leaving sweaty fingerprints on the handrail. He tripped over the last step and tumbled over the rug, narrowly missing a row of neatly potted orchids. He stood at the door, taking a deep breath. His mother normally didnt acknowledge his presence, and he didnt know what to expect. He stood straighter and walked smartly into the room. His mother looked up from a tear stained piece of paper and Eden felt his shoulders slouch his hands begin to shake. As he inched closer, he saw that the piece of paper was his school report. His heart plummeted and seeped out of his soles, anchoring him to his spot on the fluffy carpet. He had failed every subject, he hadnt turned in any assignments, his attendance was poor, he got into fights, he paid little to no attention in lessons, the list went on and on until his vision blurred and he ran out of the room, blindly tripping, stumbling, suffocating in a blanket of misery and guilt. That night, Eden darted across the orchards and ran, wanting nothing more than to talk to the tree. He hugged the tree, and whispers of reassurance echoed in his ears. He heard a leaf crackle softly behind him, and he turned quickly, wiping the tears from his eyes. He saw Donna standing there, a look of anger and disappointment in her eyes.Thats it. Youve gone too far. Im telling mother about the treehouse. Eden inhaled sharply and grabbed her arm as she turned to face the house. Donna, you cant! Theyll destroy it, you know they will. Please, Donna, dont do this to me!Donna looked at him with hard eyes that softened only for a second. Im sorry, Eden. She ran back through the mist that swirled in a dance that mocked him and whipped him with tendrils of fog that clawed at his face numb with tears and desperation. He clambered into the treehouse for what he knew to be the last time. With trembling hands, he lit a candle and crouched over the feeble warmth as if hoping that the flickering flame would thaw the ice that clutched at his heart with iron fists. He closed his eyes and rocked back and forth, paying little attention to the little candle that was now lying on its side. The flames twisted and danced over the walls of the tree house like vines of destruction. Eden felt the warmth and immediately knew what had happened, but kept his eyes closed, curled against the trunk of his beloved tree, only letting out a scream when the flames closed on his head like a crown of liquid blood. The tree tried desperately to bat the flames away from Eden, internally screaming in agony as the wrinkles on its trunk were washed with bright death. Eden was drifting, oblivious to the shouts of his family and the wail of the fire engines. His soul tore free from its tormented host and latched onto the closest living thing: the old oak tree. The water from the hoses saved the tree, but Edens charred body was beyond salvation.The tree could still feel the presence of Eden deep within its roots. It sighed, overcome with sadness. The soft crackle of leaves brought the tree back from the recesses of its memory, and the tree saw an old woman sitting, back against the trunk, as she had done every evening for many, many years.Donna never forgave herself. For years, she could not bring herself to visit the place of her brothers death, the same place that had brought him so much joy and his family misery. Her father had wanted to cut the tree down, but Donna could still feel her brother within the tree, or perhaps it was just her imagination. Though the old country mansion had been demolished years ago, Donna had vowed to sit with the tree every sunset for the rest of her life.It was just Donna and the tree, facing a fading pastel sunset that glowed pink and baby blue. The grass no longer stood straight, the leaves of the tree no longer turned golden and copper. Donna could sense the life ebbing from the tree, and looked up through the maze of branches at the starlit sky. The tree took one last breath, and exhaled. The spirit of Eden rose from the roots, and the wind whispered on last time. The stars glowed brighter as Donna cried and smiled tears that shone with the light of a thousand apologies, and the sun set forever on the story of the tree and the little boy named Eden that became something much bigger that himself."
Lavender Fields,"Leonard Goldstein looked at people on the crowded train: Some writers, some bankers, some musicians (he could tell from their loud chatter about gigs they yearned to arrive at sooner than later). The woman sitting next to him was deeply immersed in her book and he could barely move, crammed between her and a rotund gentleman who was reading  .Leonard stared at the clock in his cubicle in New York City: The lights blaring were giving him a headache as he typed the tenth article he had for Business Magazine this week. This was a rather dull, but well-paying job that he had once dreamed about during his youth.He stopped for a moment and put his head in his hand to soothe the pain, praying that no one would see him.At that very moment, his boss, Mr. Ficklesteen, walked by.Mr. Goldstein, he nodded his head.We have to meet our deadlines. I need your article by 5 p.m. sharp. Understood?! he asked sharply.Leonard Goldstein nodded, feeling like hed already run three marathons in a week and his knees, or in this case his fingers, couldnt move any more than they already had. His brain was fried, and all he yearned for was a good nights sleep. It was Friday, and the day was dragging on.It was precisely 4:30 p.m., and Leonard had been so immensely preoccupied with the ticking of the secondhand moving on the clock on the white wall that he was only halfway through his article, which, as he had been reminded so curtly and abruptly, was due in exactly thirty minutes 29 now, he realized as he glanced at the clock and he sighed. He threw together some bullshit and looked over it once.He thought, which was unusual for Leonard, being Jewish, and, as a result, a bit of a perfectionist in all matters related to money. It was a stereotype, he knew, but, in his case, it was an accurate one.He threw his mediocre article on the growing stack on Ficklesteens desk, and then nearly ran out of his office, catching a taxi back to his very nice apartment in the streets of Manhattan.That was precisely why Leonard could not catch a wink of sleep that night. The man was deeply concerned that he would be fired immediately for a piece that was subpar. It had happened before, and he was in a state of anticipating the upcoming doom that he was certain would soon envelope him.He barely slept all night, thinking of the possible events that may occur on Monday, running through horrific scenarios of losing this life he so loved over and over through his mind.The phone rang. It was Jill: his mother.Come to the farm. You need a break. The city can be overwhelming, even at the best of times, and you havent left for over a year. Maybe its time to come home. Your father and I have been working very hard on our lavender fields. The plants are quite large, and we could pour you a bath.His parents, Jill and Bob, a cowboy from the great state of Tennessee who had caught Jills rebellious heart when she was in her teens, had created this beautiful farm on a cabin with hundreds of acres in upstate New York, lavender fields as far as the eye could see.I think I will, Leonard said, forcing himself not to call Mr. Ficklesteen and apologize for his perceived wrongdoings.He booked a train and stared through the window, until it stopped where his mother had agreed to pick him up. She flooded him with a slew of questions about his fancy job in New York City.Were the people nice? she asked.I hope you are taking good care of your finances, Leonard. After all, this is one of the most expensive places to live in the country, and your father and I want to make sure youre comfortable.Leonard nodded.I am quite comfortable. You should come over sometime. I cant believe you havent yet. Its been so long.Finally, he saw them: The lavender fields that went on for miles. Walkways of stone carved meticulously through them, the purple flowers towering towards the sky as they were blowing in the wind, and a bench constructed solely for the observation of the beauty that greeted him.He sat on the ground and felt the earth with his hands. He took in the blue sky, sprinkled with only a few clouds, for the first time in what felt like forever, he breathed in the fresh air, completely inhaling and fully exhaling.For that moment, he forgot all about his fancy job in New York City, his bosss choice words that he was certain would await him the coming Monday, and the drone of his colleagues voices on the phones that never ceased during his workdays.He simply felt the sun on his shoulders and the smell of lavender on his nostrils.As he was observing the magic of this place, getting lost in it, consumed by it, his mother began cooking her signature pumpkin pie and preparing her ice cream, which wafted beckoningly through the open cabin window, and every one of Leonards sense became simultaneously enlightened as a result.That night, after a dinner that had been made with more love than any of the food in the manyDeli shops lining the streets of New York City, he snuck out of the cabin, and laid his eyes upon the stars before sleeping soundly, his worries carried away with the wind as he drifted into a peaceful slumber as he listened to his parents discussing the deliciousness of the homemade pumpkin pie in the process."
Last train for the night!,"She opened her eyes slowly and to her surprise she found herself sitting in the corner quietly on a train filled to its capacity of people still struggling trying to enter eagerly. Confused in a corner she looked right around to find some sort of a familiar face to help her get atleast one answer but sadly due everyone else on board hustling with such pace she unfortunately ended up staying in her seat with no new found ease and still so much unanswered questions which kept her far away from finding any peace. Finally the train whistle blew and the doors closed instantly causing all the passengers to leave their chaos aside & taking whatever available seats. The train moved faster than lightening but the ride itself was as smooth as silk, then out of nowhere appeared an elegant lady well dressed in what appeared to be her uniform handing out drinks out of thin air to the plentiful mix of panicking and peaceful passengers.......then when the thought to be hostess approached shy Sanj in her corner, she smiled at her and said would like a glass of milk? Sanj smiled back and said thank you but I havent any money to pay you the hostess giggled, snapped her fingers and the waiters tray she was holding suddenly disappeared. She then magically made the one glass of milk she was left holding turn in two and she handed one to Sanj, as she said to her its okay, cheers, we will share. Sanj managed to let out one her special Sandy smiles which without any doubt definitely caught the trains waitress eyes as they both began exchanging introductions. Hi, Im Sandra ,hi, Im Anne and after a few small shy sips of what was a wonderful cup of warm milk, Anne then asked Sanj youre scared arent you, its okay theres no need to fear, youre safe here and once we get there youll be so happy, you wouldnt have any care This which was said to comfort the somewhat loss Sanj left her in tears leading her to ask that one question she didnt dare. Am I .......? Those were the only words Sanj could get out till Anne stopped her before saying theres no such thing as those things here my dear, but do take a good look around and youll see this train isnt going forward my friend, its going upwards. Hearing those words Sanj eyes caught a hold of the closest window to her comfortable little corner where she saw the soaring height of train and with each passing cloud she passed by she put up a little less of a fight and lost a lil more of fright. Then came the first stop for the train that turned a lot of the passengers insane when without any warning the trains door started opening and people started falling. This continued throughout all the other stops, each stop leaving the train all the more emptier. Finally, an announcement was made all passengers left are to be upgraded to first class and with one blink of her eyes Sanj found herself there sipping some holy water of wine in what she thought to be the most beautiful glass. She was no longer in a corner surrounded by strangers but she was now in her own cabinet being visited one by one by friendly and familiar faces life had force her to become estranged with. Sanj was greeted with all her long lost loved ones from her friendly neighbour, to her sisterly friend, to cousin, her uncles, her never-met-before mother in law and father-in-law to finally the one she was waiting for to walk through her red door her very own mother, who she immediately hugged like she did no other. Ma Sanj cried as her mother wiped her eyes and smiled. They held on to each other till thesilence broke and her mother spoke Sanj I know you have a lot of questions and I know youre as happy to see me as I am to see you too but I also know youre worried about everybody, probably even angry to leave the rest of your friends and family.......its okay you can feel all that you want to feel but please just listen to me. There comes a time when we enter the train of thought concerning this illusion of time that takes over our mind until life is ready for us to hop aboard another train, this last one that flies faster and higher than any other rocket or plane.......for us to go where we meant to be, so are you ready? Her mother put out her hand in front of Sanj who just couldnt understand. Sanj was listening to everything her Mother was saying but she was also hearing her daughter crying Ma, where you? Ma, come for me na? Ma, I missing you! Ma, come for me na? Ma, i need you! Ma, come for me na? Ma, how can you leave me here? This broke Sanjs heart as much as her daughters heart was breaking causing Sanj, herself to breakdown in front of her own Mother. She said Ma, I do love you more than you know, but I cant leave my daughter! Sanj mother held her down and lifted her head up, looking straight into those innocent eyes and said in the most humblest and gentlest of tones Sanj has ever heard I know babygirl, it hurts, you didnt think it hurt me too on my train ride when I was hearing you? Sanj, I had to let go because its wasnt time for you too, dont you want to see what youre daughter is capable of doing, all that she, herself can do, thats what I wanted with you and believe me my baby you made so very proud. Dont worry Sandy even if things get bad, whenever my granddaughter gets to sad Ill teach you a trick I do whenever anybody ever got you mad and youll be glad. If you trust that the love between a Mother & a daughter is forever like my granddaughter boasts its the truest truth you ever taught her then youll leave her physically and have faith in your bond with her that youll never be apart emotionally or mentally Sanj smiled and said I know she has had a lot of failure Ma but she has my strength deep inside her and no matter what anyone thinks I know shes my warrior! Sanj then stood up the same time train came to an abrupt stop and stepped out walking out to the golden gates that opened up. Hand in hand with her Mother she walked from cloud to cloud watching down on her daughter every step of the way till her Mother said Im going to make you your favorite dinner, Ill leave you here and youll come find me after youve met our creator Sanj was left speechless as well as anxious and she started plucking away at each and every star she could reach making much too much soo much wishes for her family; her husband, her big son and her baby daughter as she continuously watched down on them all the whole time wherever they were till eventually the moon came in too soon and blocked her view. But before she could get furious she found herself noticing all she had yet to notice surrounding her. She became amazedof her surroundings that only by the bright the light of the moonshine she could now see. She found her lost self in middle of the rarest of red orchids in a greenest of fields almost completely covered by the whitest of dives flying above, standing in front of a cozy little shack with two rockers out on the porch facing such a peaceful lake while smelling her mothers fry chicken frying. Then with any sound the man with the master plan arrived, Sanj like a deer caught in headlights looked at him in awe from head to toe; his golden colour and curly hair, strong posture and pleasant smile. He hugged with a warm safe embrace and then walked her over to lake and started softly speaking i know you miss the rest of your friends and family there, the same way the ones missed you here but do look at the water in the lake right under the bright light at night under the moonshine and watch whenever you want to see your loved ones youve left but youll never leave behind. Sanj smiled eagerly as she started watching the water which to her hearts content in it she found smiling back at her was her lost daughter. And then Hanuman, her creator said to Sanj, Im here with you, Krishna is there with her but from time we do switch places for we do not sleep and work shifts back to back so were both back & forth but for now will you please stay here with us, be happy and safe and enjoying the peace please for your own sake till its your daughters time I promise you, Ill carry you with Krishna too when we go for her to take"
They got their Lesson,"So, it was a nice morning, granny was reading magazines sitting comfortably on her armchair and I was in the backyard, just playing alone with my toys.Meanwhile, I shivered as she shouted in her high pitch voice saying, ""You brat!"" I just stood up and drop that flower on the bundle and she ran off to me.""What are you doing, Roseline?"" She asked.""Nothing much, granny, just plucking the flowers,"" I replied in a sweet voice.""Ohh, so my girl is just plucking the flower,"" she said making me feeling more uncomfortable.""Yes!"" I replied.""Why are you doing so?"" She asked.""Because I love these flowers."" I answered.""No just like them, if you love them you'll not pluck them."" She said. ""Ok, leave it and tell me what about those aloe and evergreen plants?""""Aloe plants are covering a lot of space and I don't like these evergreen plants, so that is why I am plucking them."" I said hesitantly.""You know you're not only plucking plants from root but also plucking yourself from Earth,"" she replied.""I didn't get it,"" I answered.""No worries,"" she replied. ""Come inside I want you to hear a story from me.""""Story, yeah!"" I said. ""Thanks Miss Granny.""We both headed inside and sat down on a mat with some cookies and my favourite mango drink.Granny started,Long ago, there lived a girl called Sofia. Sofia was cute, charming and attractive with curly red brown hairs, yellow green eyes and redy lips. She was same as your age Roseline and that is eight years old. But she had a bad habit as same as you, that was of plucking flowers - plants without any reason. It was worse than you my dear girl.Her parents, grandparents, teachers and other taught her a lot about plants that she should not pluck them by telling the importance of it. That how it provides us with oxygen, fruits, vegetables, wood for furniture, cotton and jute, etc. There was no affect of it on Sofia. She was insist on plucking them without any reason. This made her elders worry about it. Her friends were also copying her and other children were coping her friends in plucking.One day it happened so, on a rainy day with a rainbow colour umbrella Sophia wandered to park all alone with no body around her. She sat on a desk for a while. Than her eye targeted at a adorable kitten with green eyes and it was white in colour with a pinkish glow, so beautiful. Sophia followed the cat. The cat reached to an grotto and so Sophia reached and then the cat went inside it but Sophia didn't she just sat down there and start thinking what it is like to have a pet like her.Meanwhile she found herself in that grotto with that cat. At first the grotto was all black and dark but as she stepped inside a beam came out from inside it and lead them both to the place where the grotto ended. When Sophia was having a look there that how that place wasn't any less than a dreamland a sweet voice came, Hi Sophia! Nice to meet you.What! It was from that similar cat which has now been turned into a fairy, an ugly fairy as she turned into an disgusting fairy the same place started to turn into a unpleasant place with all dark and grey sky with black and dirty clouds and half cut trees, that was very scary.This made little , immature Sophia all shocked.Disgusting fairy put her hand on her shoulder with affection which scared her even more.""No need to worry, my dear,"" said the fairy to the little girl.""What's this all?"" Sophia asked in crickled voice.""No need to fear,"" fairy said. ""You wanna know what's this all happening, right?""""Right."" Sophia answered.""It all started when I's 15 years old fairy in fairy land, I used to had a bad habit of plucking innocent plants and then it happened so that that one day queen fairy saw it all, and then she said me not to do so in future. But I didn't gave it a sight. On another day she again saw me again doing so, I's plucking plants from park because I was enjoying it. Queen fairy gave me a curse of 2 years exile. In this 2 years of exile I hafta stay on Earth in this grotto in morning I'll be a pleasant cat and in night I'll be an unpleasant fairy.""""Isn't this too cruel of her,"" said Sophia.""No, it's not."" Fairy or that cat replied. "" At first I also used to think this but later on I get what queen fairy mean. She cursed me that when I will become a cat the environment around me will like a dreamland, so pleasing but when I'll become a fairy the environment around me will become disgusting, scary. The only difference between both is one had plenty of trees and other not but it has just one aloe on which I'm surviving on as it's a very powerful plant providing me with oxygen. This step of queen fairy taught me a lesson that how important these trees are for us. And this is what now I want you to understand dear Sophia. I hope you are getting me.""""Yes dear fairy I'm getting you. I swear not to pluck anymore from now onwards,"" said Sophia to the fairy.Meanwhile this, ""Sophia, Sophia.... "" Such voice came and Sophia started rubbing her eyes and got it that it was a dream. Her mother was calling her to go for home.From this day Sophia got changed and on the very next day she planted 6 plants in garden. Looking at her, her friends also did this, and looking at her friends other children also did it.""I got you granny,"" said Roseline. ""I promise you too that I'll not pluck anymore from now. And I also got what you mean by plucking plants from root is equal to plucking yourself from Earth. As if we will pluck the plants there will no one of them will left and obviously without them how can we survive.""""That's my girl,"" granny praised Roseline."
Saif's Diary,"Dear diary, It was a nice day, I Saif, today I played a lot with Mansi, my best friend, she is a Hindu. We were playing in Mansi's backyard. Meanwhile her grandmother called us. She prepared a plate with sweets, diya(curved shape candle), small round earthen pot filled with holy water, flowers, rice, red colour thread, and dry red colour. I asked granny curiously that what this red colour is for she replied in their custom it is called kumkum and this plate is prepared for Govardhan Puja. ""Govardhan! Puja? What's this all,"" I asked confusingly. ""(In India) ceremonial worship of a Hindu deity including rituals and offerings is Puja,"" granny replied. ""What about this Govardhan Puja,"" I asked. ""Govardhan Puja is celebrated to commemorate the tale of Govardhan hill and Lord Krishna. According to the legend, when Lord Krishna was staying in Gokul, his natives were a staunch follower of Lord Indra, the God of Rains. They used to worship and supplicate him enthusiastically. However, one day, Lord Krishna questioned the villagers and advised them to worship the Govardhan hill rather than Lord Indra as the hill protected them from the rain and other calamities. Convinced by Krishnas plea, the natives started worshipping Govardhan hill. This infuriated Lord Indra and consequently, he cursed Gokul with heavy rains. Then Lord Krishna came to the rescue of the natives. It is believed that he picked up the Govardhan hill on his little finger and protected the natives who snuggled under the shade of the hill,"" she answered. ""Oh wow, it's so amazing,"" I replied. ""Since then, Govardhan Puja is celebrated day after Deepawali, the festival of lights by worshipping and supplicating Lord Krishna. It is Cereals like wheat, rice, and curry of gram flour and leafy vegetables are supplicated to the deity. On this day Govardhan hill is also worshipped by making hillocks of cow dung. Moreover, some devotees make a miniature idol of Lord Krishna, decorate it with seenkh, candles and diyas and worship it. Women on these days commonly observe day-long fasts. In some families, Govardhan puja is celebrated by worshipping Lord Vishwakarma, the God of machines. Daughters of the house worship the machines and automobiles in the house and put a tilak on each. There is also a ritual of giving money as gifts to women on this day. The day ends with a puja in which Lord Krishna is worshipped."" Grandma told me. ""Nice, it is,"" I mummered. ""You know my boy,"" she said and I glared at her. ""Not only hindu community worships mother nature, there are more who do so."" ""I would like to know their names,"" I asked in a question sense. ""One of these is Shinto,"" Granny said,""Shinto, traditionally dating back to 660 B. C. (before Buddhism), is a loosely organized religion of the Japanese people embracing a wide variety of beliefs and practices including worship of nature.Shinto religion is polytheistic in nature and it involves the worship of spirits called ""kami"". In the eighteenth century, the scholar Moto-ori Norinaga said that kami were, ""Anything whatsoever which was outside the ordinary, which possessed superior power, or which was awe-inspiring"".The followers of shintoism worship:Nature - rivers, rocks, waterfalls, the moon, and so onCharismatic people such as emperorsAbstract concepts like fertility and growthShinto teaches that everything contains a kami ,""spiritual essence"", commonly translated as god or spirit.The kami reside in all things, but certain places are designated for the interface of people and kami: sacred nature, shrines, and kamidana.Sacred Nature: There are natural places considered to have an unusually sacred spirit about them, and are objects of worship. They are frequently mountains, trees, unusual rocks, rivers, waterfalls, and other natural edifices. In most cases they are on or near a shrine grounds.Shrines: The shrine is a building built in which to house the kami.Kamidana: The kamidana is a home shrine (placed on a wall in the home) that is a ""kami residence"" that acts as a substitute for a large shrine on a daily basis."" ""Ohh..anymore?"" I asked ""It is our Hindu religion,"" she replied. Vedic people used to worship nature there god were indra(raining deity),agni dev (fire deity),marut(air deity) etchindu also worship nature, they worship sun as deity ganga as sacred river, Mountains are the place of hindu godess peepal(sacred fig) is respectful treetulsi is also sacred ..many animals like snake worship in nag panchami,Hanuman is the monkey godcow is the secred (respectful) animal Nandi (bull) and snake is the part of shiva temple ..fire used in many rituals and worship and they are secredwater use in worship there are many examples where you can find out that hindu worship (respect) nature but many people don't understand the good intention about the thingswe don't know about god but we know about our Nature if it is created by God ,we should respect and preserve it."" ""This is so informative,"" I replied. ""You know, Once lord of Air wandering on the forest ,the small trees were band,the lord of air laugh at them and runaway a head,but the banyan tree not band,,lord of air asked the banyan tree,Are you not afraid of me?the banyan tree sais,my top is called brahama,the branches are called the vishnuji,and the whole part is called the brahma ,vishu,shive,the lord of air ,salute the banyan tree and gone away by the crying face!thus the trees are worshipped by   "" She replied. ""She is so overpowering with her motherly love and concern , a deep feeling of peace and serenity overwhelm me whenever I'm in her close proximity away from mundane world . We should think Nature as a mother because she genuinely deserves a mothers respect and love. Ancient cultures personify Nature as mother because Nature embodies the aspects of nurturing and the life-giving qualities of a mother .The peace and tranquillity that we find in Nature reflect our bond of genuine love and affinity which we inherently have with Nature. The sustenance which Nature provides us is the life-line of ou existence...."" So my dear diary it's all for today. I really learnt a lot from Manisha's Grandmother."
The Woman At The Mountain Top,"Deeply hidden in the mountains, away from the rest of the world there once was a place unlike any other. On the surface, it looked like any old landscape. A mountain made green by the foliage of trees, a river running through a paradise-like valley, and a village at the foot of it it all. This was the kind of place that you might see on the hastily scribbled postcards that your backpacking friends send you to remind you that the world is bigger than you could ever imagine. A place like so many if it werent for one unique inhabitant who lived all by herself at the top of the mountain. She was believed to be the spirit of the mountain itself. Her life consisted of an endless meditation, a deep one that would allow all the elements of nature to speak to her. The wind that stroked the grass, the flowers that whispered tales of what happened underneath the earth, and the insects buzzing about the worlds they got to know better than any human ever could. All these things together would shape inside her mind into a pearl of deep wisdom that she would then sent down the stream so the villagers in the valley along with their crops and trees could hear it. The people waited all day, every day for her words to come down the stream, and whatever would arrive at their village, it always filled their hearts with peace and serenity. The nature around them flourished under the beautiful, kind words that the wise woman on the top of the mountain would send down to them. Those pearls of wisdom were sources of life for the hearts, minds, and souls of the people, as well as the trees, plants, grass, and flowers. This didnt sit well with some of the inhabitants of the village, though. There are always the people who want more than peace of mind and harmony, and so it was with the mayor of the village and his friends. Where most people saw beautiful trees, he saw the potential to build majestic palaces and statues in his honor, for him there were no beautiful flowers but just petals he could decorate his palaces with, and the animals? Well, they were there to be put in cages to celebrate his glory. His big frustration was that he knew he would never get any of the people to build all those things for him.Why would they bother to build things for me when they can just walk around with peace in their hearts all the time, he complained to one of his friends.Well, it seems they are happy to listen to whatever the wise woman from up the mountain tells them. Perhaps you should convince her to tell them the things you want them to do. Now, we have all seen enough movies to know that convincing doesnt mean having a friendly conversation over a few beers when it comes to power-hungry leaders. The old, wise woman refused many times but after they had burned down her house, destroyed her flower beds, and threatened to kill her cats and goats, the wise old woman had no choice but to send their messages down the stream. And so it happened that from that day on messages like:Build a castle. Build a statue. Worship your mayor, he knows whats best for you, were found on the bank of the river.And the villagers? Well, they did what they were told. They had no reason to distrust the voice coming down the stream since it had always brought them nothing but peace of mind and overall good feelings. After a while, something terrible started to happen though. The stream turned brown. Brown of the ugliest shade imaginable. You know, the type you get when you eat the wrong kind of food Yes, that kind of brown! The brown water no longer brought the words that whispered gently to the roots of the trees and flowers, it no longer encouraged the grass to grow in their brightest green, nor did it cover the sunlight in a layer that felt soothing on the villagers their skins. In fact, it killed all those things entirely until they all became withered, leafless, and colorless. And so it happened that one day there was nothing left alive for the wind to dance through. The people who were now without comforting words or beautiful nature were quick to rebel against the mayor and his friends. As one mob they showed up at the huge castle they had build for him. They burned the statues that they had carved for him from the beautiful trees that once grew in abundance and they released all the animals that got wild in their cages, hoping that they would run inside and devour the mayor and his friends. And the mayor? Well, as many villains do he pretended to be innocent.It was not my fault, it was the woman from the mountain top who has sent down the bad news. She was the one who told you to do what was done. She must be upset with you, she probably thinks that you dont deserve the beauty of nature or the serenity of soul. The thing with people who always got their beauty, gentle thoughts, and kind words from higher up, is that they have never learned to make their own thought pearls. Thats why they instantly believed whatever they were told by the mayor, and so they all climbed up the mountain. They begged the old woman to send them kind words again that could bring peace to their hearts, they begged her for the whispers that would make the trees grow and the river flow, but nothing happened. The problem was that the old woman simply couldnt. During her meditation, she had always relied on the whispers of the insects, the breeze of the wind through the leaves, and the scent of the flowers to bring her, her thoughts. Now that they had died along with everything else there was nothing left to give her what she had been giving to all the others. One day, as she was trying again to catch a thought that would enlighten her, she shook her head. She had been trying so long, so fruitlessly that deep down she knew that her head, nor her heart or soul would offer the answer. With a deep sigh, she looked down at her hands and knew that the only option left would have to come from them. She stood up and went to work. She planted many seeds to grow new trees and flowers, she walked great distances to get water for them and she worked the dry dirt every day to make it fertile again. The people who were still on their knees, begging her to bring back what they had lost, saw this and looked at it with amazement in their eyes. Instead of listening to their pleads, she wordlessly walked around to do all the necessary work. Reluctantly they started to do the same. After all, perhaps she was showing them what they could do to make her less angry at them. Tree by tree, flower by flower, and field by field they made the things grow back that they had lost. It took them a while, thats true, but eventually, the inner peace returned into their hearts."
We Try To Live In  A Robot,"So how did you just randomly catch me?I dont know, that idiot, who apparently calls himself the boss, told me to pick you up and throw in front of himOkay so you are a scientist, right?NO!THEN WHY THE HECK ARE WE STANDING IN FRONT OF A SCIENCE LAB!?CAN YOU STOP TALKING IN CAPS!Okay, but answer my dumb question firstJust follow me. Its safeYou are doing this all for money, from your so-called the bossExactly, but now dont talk, or else we both will get caught Velvet whispered.I am not following your stupid paths. Ill go byeDynamo! she shouted in a whisper, Okay fine do whatever, youll get caught, then youll remember my name. Go byeI seriously didnt trust that Velvet person who had brought me in front of a stupid science lab. My first goal wasnt to escape, surprisingly. My first goal was to find a real sharp knife to kill that idiot Banshee. After yesterday's climate apocalypse, those bunch of humans who survived weren't able to breathe, so they had decided to get into this robot cum statue to somehow make it work. I wasn't a human though, but I had to be with them 'cause apparently, they wanted to fill some stupid spot of the robot body, and I knew they were going to use me for back up, as I was the only one in the entire city, wandering around, in human disguise.  Oh I tell you, these scientists had done some stupid blasting experiments and messed up with the entire climate. That was the sole reason for this climate apocalypse. Gosh, I hate them even more now.  In front of me was a laboratory: the place Ive always tried to be as far away as possible from. Behind me was another lab. Then another lab appeared beside me and another. A door opened and a scientist person stepped out. Hey! he shouted looking at me.I went in my boredom mode and controlling my yawn I said,Im not who you thinkThere were a lot of flasks, some boiling with stuff and half of them were already exploded. There were noodles on the floor, and also some tomato soup. Yes, it was some sort of soup. I dont know, dont ask me.From the corner of my eye, I saw that Velvet idiot. God knows, why there was a noodle on her forehead- shaped like an inverted 3. She was climbing some statue kind of thing, placed in the corner.The statue was someancient sort of thing which , maybe those untrustworthy scientists had robbed from some museum. It was a really huge one. Like around 17 foot tall, or maybe 20. The scientist in front of me had disappeared. Spaz the hamster jumped off from Velvets shoulder and came in my direction. I looked behind and saw the same scientist but this time, he had a net with him.Uh, I rolled my eyes, whats your PROBLEM!Suddenly Velvet was nowhere to be seen and the statue started moving. It took a step and the scientist ran away, screaming on top of his lungs.Umm, okay. Thats something coolNow get in FAST! a voice came from inside the statue.A rope fell from the statues mouth.HEY DUMBO BE QUICK! I heard Velvets voice.The group of scientists behind me had lazors in their hands. Yes, I knew, my awesome face was gonna be displayed on the front page of the next days newspaper. Please not black and white.  This was so irritating. I jumped on the rope and fixed my grip.CLICK CLICK.Yes, those cameras all turned on me. People, reporters and scientists, basically all the people I hate ( I hate everyone by the way) had come to torture me.I climbed the rope and reached the statues mouth.YOURE welcome the mouth announced.Lucas! Velvets voice came from somewhere, You need to shut the mouth!Yes Lucas I had told this to you 2 seconds ago, you idiot! another voice came from inside. There was a tongue, an actual tongue with some ewsaliva.Apparently robots have saliva for no reason. Lucas!!! Velvet screamed on top of her lungs.Right sorry another voice said, whom I guessed to be Lucas. The saliva started evaporating from the tongue. There appeared some stones. Okay so now I had to use my common sense to walk on the stones to reach somewhere.Close the mouth Velvet announced.The intstructions were perfect, and the robot cum statue was actually walking, and I almost fell off. A couple of screws fell directly on my head as I stepped on the first stone and the mouth behind me started closing.And then he climbed into the mouth of Shadrick the statue andMason! Velvet called, Memory wiper!Yes, three, two and oneBOOM!There was a loud explosion outside the statue while I reached the end of the tongue. I had expected to see a long, disgusting oesophagus, but there was an elevator!I couldnt find the button so I did the most smart thing. I screamed. Hey bring the lift!Bonehead, Its right in front of youBonehead? Seriously Banshee girl. Couldnt you think of-CAN YOU PLEASE CLIMB INTO THE LIFT AND COME TO THE MAIN OFFICE?Uh yeah fine, Id love to see you throw me in front of your the boss I whispered to myself.The doors of the elevator slid open and a liftman welcomed me.Yo he said, To the topmost floor, I guess? Right?Uh yeah?K the lift man pressed a yellowish-red button which looked like a mini-brain diagram. There was brain written under it. Oh, that was necessary. Im Benjamin he said, not making eye contact with me.Nice name I wanted to laugh, because obviously I hated people the second I met them. Okay but this Benjamin person took my sarcasm seriously, wow.You must be DynamiteDynamo I corrected. There you go, the first reason on my hashtag why I hate people list. Everybody pronounces my name in the weirdest way possible and I can write down like twenty versions of it right now. Well, Velvets name was on the top of my hate list, as soon as I met her. A soft womans voice came on the speaker of the lift when it stopped on the topmost floor Do not leave the lift walking backwards, try to act normal in front of the brain Thanks for warning, I was planning to do that I said.Benjamin kicked me out of the lift. Very nice hospitality. Thank you. Probably he was irritated by me. Who isn't? Yeah like obviously. Every single person who I meet is obviously irritated by me.  Bonehead! Come here fast! I heard that banshee girl shout from a distance. The brain part of the statuewas being controlled by that over-smart, over-confident Velvet. If you've already started shipping me with her, please. Please stop, don't commit that crime. I assure, you , we're NEVER EVER gonna end up together.  Great then, Velvet kicked me in the lift and I was taken to the right hand. Everything was going fine as long as Velvet wasn't instructing me, but then I pressed the wrong button and crashed the hand into a car. Then, I kung-fu punched a scientist and managed to slap a reporter. I proudly smashed his camera.  This climate apocalypse is a complete headache to me, and I wish to get out of this place as soon as possible. I can't believe these people tolerated my stupidity. Yeah, so basically we lived like that for a few days, and it wasn't at all a ""happily ever after"". Wish me luck for getting out from that small hole right there, and yeah, I guess that's enough and I'll end it right there.   -Sara Tendulkar"
The Community Speeches,"""Deep in the woods that lie beyond the city, over hills and mountains, there is a community of people that do not worship the normal gods that you would see in mythos or other religions. Instead, they worship one of the Earth. She accepts all ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations without blinking an eye. She is graceful and elegant while being forever wild. She has the skin of peaches, hair as soft as the moss that covers the rocks in the river, a voice that sounds like the water as it runs over that moss, and eyes that can pierce souls. She is the Earth itself, as calm as a gentle breeze and as kind as the warm sun on a cold day. She is the Earth itself, as harsh as the jagged rocks of a cliff and as wild as a strong breeze that threaten to blow away everything you know exists. She is the light and the darkness, the fire and the water, the yin and the yang. She sits on a throne of thorns and flowers in the community, a picture of violent and murderous grace and mercy. The community is split into peoples who have the same personality as her. There are violent ones who answer to no one and break the rules of the community frequently, there are the kind ones who help everyone they meet and are sure to give a warm smile to those who need it, there are the wild ones who go wherever they want and don't care at all about what others think of them, and the graceful ones. The graceful ones are the group that I am in. We are quiet and anti-social. We never stray too far from Mother Earth, who is the one who sits upon the throne of thorns and flowers. We are the inventors, the imaginers, the artists and scholars. We are the advisors and warriors that stand by her side and fight for her. We are the mountains she can break, the worlds she can bring crumbling to their knees, we are the children, we are the adults. We are her yin and yang, we are neutral, chaotic, and good. We are the protection and the vulnerability that she represents. We are the fierce and timid. We are many. We keep quiet so we do not stand out and we stand out through our accomplishments. We are the women, the men, the nonbinary, the transgender, the straight, the gay, the bisexual, the pansexual, the asexual. We are everything as we are nothing. We are beautiful and we are ugly. We have scars and we are strong. However, our community is falling apart. There is nothing we can do about it. Mother Earth is dying. So we have come to the outside world for help. The pollution that those from the outside world are forcing upon her is killing her. To stop her from dying forever, we must do what we can to minimize global warming and climate change. Otherwise, we will lose our ruler and we will go to war. This is not a declaration of war. Not yet. We will wait and we will watch for the world to speak up and realize what is wrong with it. We will actively encourage others to commit to the necessary change. We will continue to fight for our lady, and ourselves.""""Recently I have noticed that no one has accepted the fact that we need a change. Our lady is dying and no one is doing anything about it. She is real, and she is here. On her throne of thorns and flowers, she continues to slowly die because of this worlds' pollution tendencies. For progress to happen, people need to commit to the necessary changes and actions needed for it to change. We will not tolerate the disrespect you have given to our lady. I will remind everyone that this is not a declaration of war. However, if something does not change, we will use the power that Mother Earth has given us to start the world anew. We will leave behind those who wish her harm and start a new society in which she will be well cared for. This is merely a warning. Do not abuse Her Grace. She has been merciful so far, but she tires of the constant abuse that is caused by pollution that  are creating. She tires of this constant battle against the world. I beg of you, -we beg of you- to please change your habits so they benefit her and do not harm her more. We do not want a full out war. But we are prepared to fight one for our lady.""""I would like to thank all who have gathered here. We would like to report that our lady is only doing slightly better. However, we are not out of the woods yet. We need the continued support to end pollution entirely to save our lady. We are still willing to fight an all-out war if things get worse. Please, I beg of you, end pollution and help us save Mother Earth.""After this last speech, the community had to go underground and eventually die out. The Mother Earth they mention appears to have succumbed to the disease that they claimed was because of pollution. Too many people did not pay attention to this group's warning and, after 30 years of the last speech being given, the world finally ended in famine, disease, and bloodshed. The apocalypse that occurred 20 years after this speech killed 24% of the world's population with famine, 39% of the world's population with homicide, 36.9999999999% of the world's population with disease. The last person to be left alive shot themselves because of depression. Before the apocalypse started there were reportedly almost exactly 9 billion people alive, around 8.5 billion of which had been contributing to pollution and global warming at the time. Only 100 million of these people were advocating for the end of pollution. A century after the apocalypse, the community returned, and as promised, started anew."
Newt,"There were many names for them, used by them, but only one name which they were called by others, and that was simply those folk. This title was uttered darkly, with god-fearing suspicion, and usually in the shadow of a bar when the conversation has worn thin, and the townsfolk need something to talk about other than Mrs. Petunias homosexual son (a person they were united by in their revulsion of.)	Those folk were well known-of but certainly not well-liked. Occasionally they came down from those mountain peaks they rested on, shouting about the wonders of the planet, and on those days the people of the town shuttered their blinds, locked their doors, and forbade children from wandering outside. They crossed their foreheads with holy water and lingered in their kitchens until the danger had passed.	For years and years, those folk and their small-town Christian neighbors had been in a sort of war with each other, a war that each side was determined not to lose and that wasnt really a war, to begin with, rather a splitting crosshair of ideas. Townsfolk would not go near, and therefore those folk-- or as they preferred to call themselves, Those Who Wander, stayed tucked up in their temples and forests. They didnt need to, really. What they wanted was being brought to them by their neighbors without lifting a finger. They reclined, and performed their duties, and danced in circles around flames, and some of them, when they were deep in the throes of their thoughts, wondered vaguely of what they used to be; but it wasnt long until they were dragged up and dancing, and they were wild instead, wild and beautifully free.	... 	There are stories, of course. Such things spark the interest of anyone interesting enough to have an imagination. Whats actually true but not fun to think about slips away slowly, until the false tales have filled the minds of every child in the town, and even some of the adults naive enough to believe them.	Children are wonderfully creative, more so than adults, because as a child nothing is impossible yet. I often subscribe to the theory that our dreams are our inner child inside, desiring to scream and laugh and pin what doesnt make sense together into one big gloopy collage decorated with bits of macaroni from our craft-making days.	Chief among the packs of stories and storytellers was Newt Riggins, who was small in stature, with knobbly knees and a shiny bowl haircut his mother insisted he kept, and a pair of rectangular spectacles that he pushed up his nose before he began a really good bit. He had a bright red spot on his chin that he insisted was a burn from those folk. Though a complete liar and a bit of a twad, Newt had the best stories for miles around, and even people older than he would silence themselves to listen when he began.	Its unclear what Newt was; a bit crazy, perhaps. It certainly showed in his eyes, the way they shone pale silver when he began a tale or was getting to an especially gory part, usually about how those folk cut up the genitals of young squirrels to toast in their fires worshipping whatever they worshipped, it was never very clear. Newts only redeeming quality was his abilities with words, but lucky for him they were quite redeeming indeed. He was able to attract a small group of friends with mental capabilities high enough to realize that Newt Riggins on their side was better than Newt Riggins on someone elses side-- but not quite high enough to exceed Newts own cognitive workings.	The story begins one hot afternoon when everything in town has been reduced to putty and people have vanished inside in hopes of drawing cool air from the walls of their homes by shutting the blinds as tightly as if those folk were coming again, with their preachings and pamphlets and declarations. 	Flies melt and drop in midair, where they get sticky on the petals of wilting daisies. A dog not long meant for this cruel, hot world pants in an alleyway, and people are wringing sweat out of their clothes through the windows. Ice and cool air is a distant dream, seated at the tempting and horribly far snow-topped peak of the mountain where those folk live.	Newt holds court under an ugly and twisted apple tree while his friends pant, gazing up at the sky in fevered agony. He isnt reduced to such configurations. Newt sits upright, recognizing both that it was a more powerful position and that thinking about how hot you were seemed to only make things worse.	Its a bird, he says decisively.	It aint, Im tellin you, argued Maybelle.	Got to be, Newt says. Cant think of anything else that would build nests like that. Look, there are bits of string woven in.	Mud, too, insisted Maybelle. And I know for a solid fact that birds aint usin mud in their nests. They use sticks.	Some of em gotta use mud, said Ellie, examining their object of interest and poking it with a skinny finger. How else are they keepin their nests together? If I made somethin outta sticks, its gonna break in a few minutes.	Cash snorted from where he lay, his arms flung over his head and tickling the stone-hard earth. He was the only one brave enough to lie with the anthills; the others, after seeing what had happened to little Stephie Miller one dark summer day, had chosen to take their chances with the tree. But Cash preferred to think himself a rebel, no matter how misguided this judgment might be.	Youre a right idiot, Ellie, he murmured. Birds weave sticks, cause they have instincts and stuff.	That cant be true, weavins harder than it looks and all they got is beaks, said Ellie, an excellent point in the others opinions. Something occurred to her.And Im not stupid. Cash, you be a right evil bastard.	Cash said that bastard was a bad word.	But you called me stupid, so I say were even. snapped Ellie, a flush lingering in her dark cheeks.	A bird aint smart enough to bind their nests together anyway, Maybelle said from above, dismissively, flicking a piece of bark at Cashs ear and missing to her disappointment. Birds got brains the size of a grape. Aint a lot a knowledge packed inside a grape.	Snot true, said Cash, frowning at her over his stomach. Birds have instincts, thats what. They know how to build nests. Instincts much better than knowledge is, I tell you that.	Knowledge gets you to college, says Ellie.	Nah, says Cash. Thats instinct. College gives you the knowledge ya need, once ya get there. But not me, Im plenty smart already. To prove his point, he turned and spat into the grass.	You disgust me, Maybelle said primly.	Whats the point a school, then, if all we need sinstincts? Ellie asked.	Cash said he reckoned it was grown-ups way of getting them out of the house so they could do important grown-up things children didnt need to be there for. Its all a sham, he said, so the parents can do taxes an dust your room an-- an-	Make babies, suggested Ellie.	Maybelle wrinkled her pretty little nose and Cash asked how they did that.	Dunno, but I reckon they gots to at some point, right? I never seen my parents make a baby while I was home so probly while Im at school.	Yes, but ?	I suppose it must involve both parties, somehow, Newt said thoughtfully. A man and a woman. Two forms come together to create one in a way imbuing the man with equal responsibility for a child, so hes checked by his conscience from running off and abandoning the baby. Probably a messy experience. Maybe they chop off their own limbs, sew a few things together, then stick it up the woman so she can give birth.	The others fell silent at this extraordinary announcement, but Newt returned his serene little gaze to the snowy mountains of those folk.	Cash took up the reins.	My mum aint missin limbs, though.	Maybe she used to have a bunch, but they were all gone for children. Ellie mused, plucking at a piece of crabgrass dying in the heat.	Need a lot a limbs, then, growled Cash. His mother happened to be the resident pregnant woman. Theres one in every town: the woman who has about a hundred squirming kids running around and no explanation of a father. Cash had about nine siblings that he knew of.	Oh! Maybelle said eagerly. Maybe a lot like birds! The mummies and daddies jump around or somethin an the big belly is the egg waitin to be laid, now that makes sense.	Cash and Ellie considered this, then Cash nodded his satisfaction. Makes a lot a sense to me, I reckon.	Why aint mummies and daddies buildin nests then? Ellie frowned.	Maybe they do and we just dont know about it, Maybelle murmured.	There was a hushed silence in which all four children resolved to check for birds nests when they got home.	Newt spoke up again. They worship birds on the mountain.	Everyone looked at him eagerly.	Strue, said Newt, striking a formidable figure nestled in the crook of the apple tree, bowl haircut gleaming in the sunshine. Birds are beloved on the mountain, the same way Timmy loves that parrot he has. Up there they preen the feathers of every songbird that passes by and keep baskets of bread on hand for when the crows are here nnouncin murder. The same way Timmy feeds his parrot bits of crackers and tries to train it to take messages, thats what they doing with their birds. Really, Timmy belongs up there. he added mockingly.	Why, though? Maybelle asked, but quietly so as not to interrupt.	Cause wars coming, breathed Newt, his grey eyes alight. Third World War, n all that. Those folk on the mountain know about it since mountains are so high up and they can see everything from up there. They can see the peoples in China amassin their big bombs, and they watch the Brits training up soldiers and they can see the Russians sending out services to spy on everybody. Those folk know everything.	Cash frowned at a patch of dust in front of him, thin boy legs crossed. Why do peoples always wanna fight?	People are people, Newt answered, shifting in his tree crook, which was beginning to get uncomfortable. To satiate our own egos and reassure ourselves of our own power, we take it out on our neighbors and make them fear us. Fear is safer than friendship because it stands no chance of being broken by someone else first.	Cash mutters that that seemed like a silly reason.	The birds love the folks on the mountain, cause they think theyre really nice an all that, Newt continues. But all the folk on the mountain want to do is to use birds-- train them-- cage em up real tight and keep them to deliver messages when the End of Days comes by. Because there'll be a bunch of people stranded all over and humans need a way to communicate with each other. So all theyre doing is getting the birds ready for a great war destined to wipe us all out forever.	Huh, says Ellie. I didnt know peoples were gonna be wiped out forever. Is it gonna happen soon?	Soon enough, I reckon, the day that China decides theyre sick a making everything for everyone else, shrugged Newt, climbing higher from the fork of his tree branch. His skinny legs disappeared into the canopy of leaves above.	Newt, shrilled Maybelle. You best not be fallin from there, I aint catchin yah, and your mum and dad are gonna be real mad if you break somethin!	Oh, hush your mouth Maybelle, Newt answered vaguely from somewhere above them.	Maybelle glanced furiously at the other two for help but they simply rolled their eyes at her. She could be annoying to hang out with, but she was also clever and pretty and had a lot of friends and in the trenches of elementary school, she was a good ally.	All of them were, really. In another world without Newt Riggins in it, the other three might have been destined to a future other than following someone elses lead. Its nice to imagine that world: Cash would have been the ringleader to a group of boys who enjoyed picking on Maybelle and her friends, Ellie would hold the record for the fastest sprinter in the school if she tried out instead of listening to tales of birds on the mountain. When those folk came knocking, the other three would regard them with interest and make up their own stories, which while not as good as Newts would have been perfectly acceptable.	But now, instead, Newt Riggins stood at the top of an apple tree, hand resting on a branch, high up but not the sort of child who had a fear of falling. His small face was turned towards the mountains; his brain, large for a little boy, was churning and considering and coming up with new ideas.	 he thought, considering the idea. It had potential.	He sniffed and climbed back down."
Life alike a Train,"[Beware of language]  . I sat in this crowded train, filled with people unknown to me and surely don't give damns about one another, but oh well, so do I. Today, I finally became jobless. It wasn't completely my fault, but then again, who's gonna listen to me? I am quite a loser when it comes to handling things that surely help me to keep moving forward. After all, it was my failure that she left me, my family. She was a wonderful woman but just one mistake took her away from me well, I agree there were more than one, but then again, if she tries a little harder then Nah, I'm just comforting myself, I was crystal clearly wrong, is. The job, though you know what, I am just roaming my thoughts so that I can get through this out, ahh, if I just had a cigarette, but you know, this place isn't that bad for thinking absolute nonsense, like, who will care? Most of the people here are rather stressed out old geezers or some single, ugly high schoolers who are simply fucked by our cute little society as I wandered my eyes around, yes, that's what I see. But still, I love how they literally go back to their schools again, and again, and again, putting that fake smiles and playing around like they actually having fun, but surely they are just messing around, waiting for growing up, waiting to fly far, far from this broken system, but then I swirled my eyes to those old geezers, standing in this same train, in this same block, I giggled a little, after all, how fake can one person think? I was barely holding my laugh, laughing and thinking of how can they just think about something like that? But after remembering I was the same, my laugh suddenly fades, but, oh well, I at least thought something real. I remember when I was their age, I used to think about a happy little life will I have, a nice wife, waiting for me at home, cooking something I like as then I kissed her cheek, walk into the house as my kids run to surprise me, then they shout my name out loud, saying they missed me and so do I. ""Wait."" I unexpectedly whispered and then recalled some of my actual memories but not the high school fantasies, I just remember that I  have it, a loving family, it might not be good as I dreamed but not in the least it was bad. I don't know why some beads of salty water filled my eyes, I don't know why my heart aches, but only I want to see them.  The train stopped slowly and calmly, but I was thinking about the day when I first met her. It was the first day of my job, I ran fast to catch the only train for, it was a quite harsh day but then after I reached the station, it simply got worse because the only train has left for the destination, I swirl my eyes across everything, running to someone that could help me, but in the end, it will take more than three hours for another train to come, my shoulder weighted by anxiety and recalling my boss's face who I met at interview, will eat my ass, I loosen my legs and sat on the floor of that train station, thinking about how ridiculous my life is and has been but then an echo rings in my ears, at first I didn't notice but then again it rang like a fairy calling me, and then when I whirl my head, I saw beauty. ""You okay? Where are you going?"" She asked me and lapped a warming hand onto my shoulder. ""Tokyo"" I said with a gloom like our school team had lost a match to a school where the friend I hate most goes. ""Well, Tokyo is quite far from Nagoya, that is"" As then after the fade of her words the moment kind of turned even gloomier. ""Can I sit here?"" She again said and I nodded, some minutes passed. ""You know, today I got fired from my job."" I spun my gloomy stares to her. ""What a coincidence, today I got fired before I could work there,"" I said. ""Well, you can go tomorrow, you know."" She said. ""Nah, I don't think that fatass will take me in."" And I said, and again some minutes passed. ""Wanna go somewhere else?"" She said and so our journey began, after that, we went to a cafe, then to a restaurant and then, to a bar. ""You don't drink?"" She once asked. ""They say, I won't be the same person when I do."" And once I replied  I opened my eyes slowly as the train got slow like a snail. Argh, my head hurts, just how long I have been asleep? But when I wandered my eyes around, I saw no one, those old geezers and those single, ugly high schoolers, none were here any more, I was simply alone in this block of the train so yes, I might've been in a long sleep. After some thought I crossed, I took out a handkerchief, cleaned my face, but as I was doing so, a word carved in this handkerchief came into my eyes. ""Love you."" It was written in the middle of a heart at the right corner, and somehow I was able to hear it, loud and clear. Yes, after that day, we spent time together more than anything, even more than our jobs which we soon got fired off. But you know, I just never realised back then, how beautiful this lady is, but I was at least smart enough to marry her at about the right time, like, I was moments away before her family made an arranged marriage for her and I barely managed to take her from her father's grasp, funny?, isn't it, and so step by step, we found something that we never felt in our previous life, happiness, we soon then moved to Tokyo, having some little happiness was all we needed, yes, that's what all we needed and still might have if I hadn't The train began again, slow but soon fast, enough for me to fall into the old and fragile memories while watching that beautiful sea from my window. After we moved to Tokyo, life became a little fast, when the days came and passed, we never came to know even with calendars, all there was left was some ache in the back and head, tons of scoldings from my new fatass, but then when I think there's someone at home in a wait, I just smiled knowing at least there are people out there who cares and if I simply stuck to that, I might have it, even now, my family. It happened that day, yes, I remember it like it was yesterday, although it wasn't a single day, but surely that's when everything started. ""Wanna go to night's party?"" He was an employee of this, that company and a colleague of mine as we sat next to each other, we came to know each other much more than others. ""Nah, I have errands to run,"" I said as I declined the offer. ""C'mon man, I've never seen you in action, at least this time be honest."" He insisted. ""Well, my life has been this way,"" I said and again, declined. ""Well, aren't you able to have some time for yourself?"" If I remember correctly, those words hit me hard. ""What do you mean by 'yourself'? I am happy with my beloved wife."" I got angered. ""Now, now, calm down a bit, that's not what I meant,"" He said. ""You see, I have been keeping an eye on you for a long time, you came and went on time, you barely talk to anyone, even me, and whenever I see you, all you do is watch the clock. I never saw you having fun, ya know."" And even more, those words wounded me. He was wrong about I'm not being happy, I am happy with my wife waiting for me, I am happy to have her, but when he said the habits that somehow don't feel good and anxious after noticing them once. Did I do that? I asked myself. I have lived my whole life like a never-ending train, my childhood was the only thing that I can say was stress-free but I surely don't remember it to rely on it for the rest of my life, afterwards my life filled with achievements, fake smiles, unknown friends, family unknown love, and mostly money, I was as if was a slave to these. Yes, I was happy, but was I living? These all thoughts crossed my head in that single second while my colleague stood before me. ""So, are ya coming?"" He lapped a hand onto my shoulder. ""Come."" He again said with a sympathising face. And so, I went there where I have been running since I was in college. It was quite a big hall and had many beer bottles all over as I walked, yes that's what I see. ""C'mon man, walk fast, it's not like your first time here."" My colleague, who walked before me said, but little he knows it my first time in this kind of place. After we walked for quite a while, we found seats, and red lights across all over the place, dancing and enjoying peoples, living peoples. ""Drink!"" He asked from a young bartender. ""I don't."" Although I declined. ""What's your problem, we're adults of society, if we can't do this much then they will rusticate us from it, from the position we work hard to get."" He was a nice man with nice words which knows how to change one's mind. Yes, I didn't drink after an event in my college years, although, I don't remember the whole event, somehow my friends came to wary afterwards while others said, I should never drink it again even on the last day on earth. Yet, I was overconfident about how I would become the man of society, and so, I drank, one cup after another after another, I drank like a mad man, like never before. I was for the first time in this long-lived life I felt like I can do anything I want, I can literally do anything, and in those faulty depths, I didn't notice more than forty-five missed calls and more than twenty-three messages from my beloved wife. I went back to my house, soaked in the smell of wine and beer, vomiting in allies, I walked, forgetting everything I loved except my own self, I somehow reached that little graceful facade of my house, small yet was filled with happiness. But you know, back then I wasn't in the least thinking this way, I was so into those beers, I somehow was feeling upset, I was pretty upset. I knocked on my door a few times but no one opened it and so my slams got rash upon the door and after some more minutes, she opened it, and looking back as from now, I remember even in those beers, she was trembling like never before. ""Where have you been!"" She yelled. ""I was scared, I thought, something might've happened to you!"" She again yelled but then hugged me tightly, after all, she loved me, ""Wait, you're drunk?"" and just thinking about what I did afterwards, gives me an ache in my heart. ""Shut up!"" I yelled. ""And get out of way!"" I pushed her and walked straight in. ""W-what do you mean, I was worried!"" She yelled again while I was taking that coat. ""Hey, listen to me, I am talking to you!"" She again shouted reasonably and grabbed a sleeve of mine. ""Shut up!!"" I yelled all out from my throat and pushed her afar as she slammed into walls. ""I am not your slave, let me be free!"" I shouted and then went for my bedroom, but before, I got that glimpse of her, she hit her head onto the wall and was bleeding and yet, yet I left her, alone and sombre, I did the undone. It was day one, from that day on, I went to the bars over and over and over and over, 'living' my life, while she worries at home, alone, and when she asks, I hurt her, yes, I did those unforgiving, over and over till she shattered into pieces. I simply became selfish, to live I abandoned my happiness and she paid the price I wish, I  I don't know why all these memories are flooding now, maybe it's my job that I got fired from, or might be this train, but yeah, I can once say, I am awful, as then, after viewing the last station l stood and walked out from this be delightful train as cold breezes snuck around my neck. ""Ahh"" I exhaled out while walking in this green ocean of grass, towards that orange sun of dusk. It was out from the station, a place mostly viewed by tourists but as right now, the weather is not quite one to visit here, but at the end, my thoughts melted even more. It's been over five years since our divorce, now I heard, she's living a happy life with her new husband and you know, I got to know afterwards that she has a child in her belly when I was blooming with my 'living', my baby, and that man was kind enough to let both of them in his huge heart, what a nice man she married, literally her father's choice was right on the point, and while hers got fired from my last job, I don't even know that another interview will work at this age. I always wondered, do people care about each other and, yes, I came with an answer, but to some extent, if the ticker comes to their own selves, then they chose themselves like I always thought, if that colleague of mine, who is by the way, now head of a team of half of the office, like, if he chose my happiness over a partner in his lonely drinks, I might've Nah, if I was that shallow then one day this you know what, I'm tired of it, was it me who was wrong or others around me, I don't know anymore, but one thing is sure, we humans don't give a damn about each other, yes, that's a pure and simple truth. My whole life was just like that train, slowing, stopping and then picking a fast pace and not stopping until the next station, yes, that's how my life has been. All I wanted to be free from this unending slavery but forgot just what little she has to do with it, she wasn't the person who enslave me, but rather give me a new life filled with happiness. I am still foreign to why I walked, wondering about my life but soon reached the dead-end, it was a cliff from were down was the ocean, crashing against mighty rocks at the bottom, I see, this place, I swirled my eyes across and behold the beauty of nature, ocean, green grass shining upon dusk reflection, cold breezes, the sun playing hide and seek with clouds. I simply stared at this mighty sight, and just then, just then, came to know something, ""Just, how small we are"" I whispered, yes, how tiny we are, and how little our problems matter compared to this incredible world. All that sudden, the aches somehow felt lighter for a second, thinking that at least I was born human, I closed my eyes and took a deep long breath, wandering my eyes while opening them. ""I'm lost,"" I said proudly."
Its All better in a Fairy Tale,"Its All better in a Fairy TaleOnce there was a girl who live such a perfect life in a perfect place. A place where only kindness reigns, a place where evilness can never grow. A place where even on a rainy day you will see the sunshine. A place so warm It is tinted with yellow. This place must be what yellow feels like.She lives in a village surrounded with trees.Lively plantsBright flowersHappy facesFree animalsNo matter where you look there is no hint of cruelty living in this world.Everyday she wakes up with a smile on her face while listening to the birds singing peacefully in harmony. She get up everyday and never forgets to water the plants, she grew a garden so beautiful that butterflies and bees never get tired of visiting it everyday. Everyday, the people in her village plants a new tree and grew lots of garden until they ran out of place to plant. The air is so clean, the only scent you can smell is the lingering scent of daisies and lavender. They treat every animal with kindness no matter what they look like. Fury or not, tamed or wild, they make sure every animal is loved. Every night her mother sings her lullaby while she is sleeping under the moonlight while the crickets sings along with her mother.Everyday is special in their village, the people are always smiling, no signs of greediness. The people never failed to help others.All of this are because of and old saying from their ancestors. Mother Nature is so kind that she let us live in her, to repay herwe must be kind to her and to always be in peace with natureThe girl ran her fingers to the carved words below the statue of a dove in the center of our village as she was reading it. We must. The girlwhispered and looked at the sky.***Tomorrow is my birthday and my mother and I will bake a cake for the village to share, every year we do this to strengthen the bond of the people. Why is it so peaceful, mother?. I asked her calmly. Her eyebrows furrowed and she looked at me with her gentle eyes and asked  dont you like peaceful?. I was silent for a minute. I grew tired of being peaceful mother, I want something that makes my heartbeat so fast I could hear it. Maybe, I crave chaos so much because I never got to experience it. I like it, mother. I love being in peace. I lied.That night I couldnt sleep, all I did was stare at the ceilingandthink of the endless possibilities that I might experience in another world. A chaotic world. wake up, sunshine. Its your birthday!. My mom greeted me with a smile. The moment I opened my eyes I saw my mothers beautiful face with excitement all over her face.Its my birthdayI went outside and wandered in the garden for a bit. Everyday always have a hint of yellow but today is different it is cold and blue, the melancholic kind of blue. The kind of blue that can turn your insides upside down. I closed my eyes  and ignored the melancholic atmosphere, my eyebrows furrowed. What is that smell? It smells like rotten fish. I opened my eyes and a shocking event flashed before my eyes.I gasped and covered my eyes in fear,Blood... Blood everywhere... The blood splattered all over the place... All I could hear was screeching and laughter... Pain... They are in pain yet these cruel people are laughing.  I just saw a man slit the throat of a pig. I heard the pic cried in pain. I slowly opened my eyes and wandered around the place. I saw a lot of horrible things.A man slaughtering every kind of animals, some animals are even turned into clothing. I looked at the people, the smile on their faces when they slaughter poor and innocent animals is scary. The smirk and the look of satisfaction is frightening. Why must they do this? What did the animals ever do to these people? I walked around hoping to find a kind soul in this awful place but instead I saw an empty field with a lot of wounded trees.I looked around hoping to find flowers but I couldnt. all I could see is dead grass and No! dont cut the poor trees, you have cut a lot of trees already. I shouted while running towards them. But they dont seem to hear me. I tried to take the axe and saw in their hands but I couldnt. all I can do is watch them ruin our mother nature as I cry in agony.My knees fell in to the ground as I looked up the sky, I couldnt even see the sky all I could see is dark clouds. A raindrop fell in my face, at first I thought it was just my tears. It rained, it rained so hard all I could see is fog.I can feel her, I could hear her. I could hear mother nature cry in anguish.Im sorry, mother. Im sorry, I couldnt stop them. Im sorry you have to suffer like thisThe sun shined again, I was supposed to be happy. But I could feel my skin burning, why is it so hot? I looked at the sun. I was looking for a place to stay shelter me away from the agonizing heat of the sun but all I could see is the sea. I was going to dive in the water but it looks filthy. I could see an island full of trash and the horrible and unbearable smell.Wait. I looked around and saw a polar bear so skinny you could see through his bones. I ran to it and hugged him. oh bear, what has happed to you?. The bear was too weak to even move. I looked at him and all I could see is sadness. I hugged him tight and cried. Im sorry I whispered to his ears. What is this place?! Is this hell?!. I shouted in frustration. This is what a chaotic world looks like, sweetie. This is reality, this is what the real world looks like. Its chaotic and not beautiful. I heard the gentle voice of my mother, I cant even look at her. All I could do is cry.hush, love. Everything will be okay. Her voice is so comforting, I wish it could make me forget about my worries. I-Ifthis is reality, then what was the world that we lived in, mother?. I asked between my sobs, Im confused about everything. we live in a fairy tale, sweetheart. She said and hugged me even tighter. You have two choices, either we will go back home and live a perfect life or live here and be baked in the sun. My mother joked to release the tension.  Whatever your decision is I will come with you. But, reality isnt that bad. You have only seen the bad things about humanity. There is still a kind soul here somewhere, sweetie. I just gave her a reassuring smile to let her know that I feel better now. What I saw was already enough to make a decision. This horrible memory will forever be buried in my soul. Happy birthday to you!. The villagers cheered as I blew the candle.I regretted thinking I crave chaos when in fact I could not even bear to see my hands getting wounded.I could have been brave but I chose to be a coward and lived the life I want even if its only a fairy tale. I chose to leave a peaceful life and turned my back on the cruel reality.Life is better in a fairy tale, anyway.Or is it?"
Earth Didnt Wait,"My mom used to tell me this story about her home planet, Earth. She told me all about this once magnificent planet, but when I looked out of my spaceship window, all I saw was a scary ball of flames that used to hold beautiful, green trees, vast oceans, and oxygen that seemed to last forever. The humans needed to eat for fuel, drink water to live, and oxygen to breathe. Mom said that Earth was home to many families, children went to school, and everyone was happy at one point. But one day, Earth changed.	It wasnt all of a sudden, but certain events led up to this moment. The humans would cut down trees for their buildings like stores and houses. They learned how to make paper from trees and would cut down about 15 billion trees each year. My mom would show me a picture of a tree and it looked gorgeous. It looked so alive and green that I couldnt believe it even existed on the toxic planet. She told me that birds of all colors and sizes would live on the trees and sing happy songs. Mom would smile at the picture and then become sad, saying that one day, there were no more trees the humans could cut down, and it caused many problems.	The humans couldnt breathe in carbon dioxide because it was toxic to them. But CO2 levels on Earth had gotten so high that not many of them could survive. A lot of the humans had a hard time breathing and it even got to the point where they had to always wear oxygen masks to live. You see, the trees that they cut down inhaled carbon dioxide and exhaled oxygen. If the humans hadnt cut down all of their trees, there would still be air for them to breathe. Animals also lived in these trees, sheltering and protecting them. Mom said that the humans could have recycled their products, try to use cloths instead of paper items, and plant more trees to avoid what happened.	Another problem that contributed to the humans air quality is their use of fossil fuels. They used it to heat their homes, produce electricity, and as gas for their cars. One tank of gasoline could take their car hundreds of miles. The humans used fossil fuels so much because it didnt take much processing to make. What they didnt know was that fossil fuels released a lot of harmful by-products, creating pollution and affecting their air quality. Fossil fuels are also a non-renewable resource, meaning once you use them, theyre gone. The humans were also using fossil fuels much faster than they could be made. What the humans could have used instead of fossil fuels are renewable energy sources, meaning resources that can be naturally made over a short period. Some examples are solar panels and wind turbines. If the humans used these resources, they could have had more time on their planet.	Mom said that Earth used to have blue, massive oceans. She would show me a picture of her next to something called a beach. It had blue water and huge waves, like something from my dads old history books. The oceans provided water and had sea creatures like sharks, fish, and octopus that have 8 legs! I find that hard to believe but if they did, the creatures are long gone now. The oceans also produced oxygen for the humans to breathe. There are a few theories about how the oceans changed drastically, but here is one: carbon dioxide. With so much carbon dioxide on Earth, it could have turned into ice and covered the oceans. Eventually, as it gets warmer, the ice would melt and evaporate. If the humans had done as was suggested before to decrease their levels of CO2 on their planet, maybe they would still have one. Maybe I would also have experienced this Great Earth.	Eventually, the human population decreased so much that there were not many left. They couldnt live without the oxygen their trees provided and the water and air their oceans gave. The humans had only one planet and now its gone. My mom and dad were astronauts when the downfall of Earth happened and got on a rocket ship to live in space. My daily life is to wake up, make sure my space suit is intact, and check to see if I have enough oxygen for the day. Sometimes its annoying because the stuffy suit would get in the way of the things I need to do like schoolwork.	Mom and Dad would switch off teaching me different subjects, but I loved learning about Earth. If Earth was my planet, I would have definitely taken good care of it for future generations to enjoy natures beauty. The humans only got one planet and its not easy getting another one once you have destroyed it. I dont even think you could get another one! My parents told me that back then on Earth, humans didnt have to go through the hassle of paying and caring for an oxygen tank. Its second nature to me though. Im jealous of those humans on Earth; they got free oxygen just from big, green trees and were able to swim in the vast, blue oceans. Dad tells me that one day I might be able to go to Earth and experience its beautiful nature, but I could tell he doubts that would happen because of the unlivable toxic atmosphere.	I was born and raised in this rocket and never got to see rainforests or feel the wind of the beach, but I heard that its amazing. I could only hope and pray that I would have those luxuries. Breathe in fresh air from trees instead of the air of oxygen tanks. I want to feel the sun on my skin without getting burned because the ozone layer is basically gone on Earth. Earth didnt wait for the humans to change their ways, so it showed them a life without it."
Knick the Knight,"Knick the Knight eyed the bottomless chasm ahead of him, aware that certain death lay at the bottom, Knick spoke to himself as he rocked back and forth, armour clinking and clunking as he moved, preparing for the leap of faith through darkness. He could hardly see the other side, but he knew it was the only way. He geared up, and Knick ran full tilt and leapt through the air, flying over the two foot fissure. Despite the short hop, Knick stumbled on the landing, tweaking his bad knee, but quickly composed himself and raised both arms in the air. He sticks the landing! Knick circled slowly, ignoring the pain in his knee as he waved and smiled at the cheering crowd he imagined. 	The hoard of treasure awaits, but so does the vicious dragon, Knick spoke as he slowly limped through the dark tunnel, each foot slowly reaching into the darkness to find sure footing. He lowered his voice to a whisper as he timidly stepped into a large cavern filled with what looked like dunes of sand. Knick the Knight... on the verge of gaining honour and riches  steps into the dragons lair ba-da-da-duh... He murmured a catchy hero tune and unsheathed his blade. Light filled the space from a source beyond his view around the craggy walls. As his eyes adjusted he saw the dunes were not of sand, but of coins. Millions of small, golden coins piled high above and around Knick in heaps and piles. Jewels of sparkling colours sprinkled throughout the mounds, twinkling as if calling out their worth, begging to be taken. 	Knicks eyes widened as he walked around the slippery mess of coins, circling the area all while humming his theme song. He passed another mound of gold and beheld the massive form of the dreaded dragon. The beast was the size of four horses at best, his flank raising slowly in deep slumbering breaths. He approaches the beast, sword held high, ready to attack, Knick whispered then continued humming, eyes never leaving the slumbering beast. The dragon almost blended into the coins with its yellow-gold scales, but there was a muted feel to the scales. As if they havent reflected sunlight in ages. 	He steps towards the vile villain, sword grasped tightly, ready to pierce the dragon in its one weakness, Knicks voice slowly rose from a whisper to a conversational volume. Through its eye- 	Through my  The dragon suddenly spoke, its head shooting into the air causing Knick to squeal loudly and trip over his feet, losing his sword in the clumsy fall. The dragon gazed down over Knick, Why would you stab me in my ? What a terrible thing to do! How did you know I was here? Knick asked while trying to hide his trembling as he rose to his feet. You cant be serious Knick looked confused. Well you cant exactly sing a theme song as you try to sneak up on someone. Especially a creature with exceptional hearing. I heard you before your , the dragon said mockingly. There are no chasms in this mountain. I find humming , he defended himself as he picked up his sword. Its not easy doing this all alone! Besides, it worked just  when I took down your massive guardian. The dragon tilted his head, Guardian? What guardian? The giant spider- Spider! The dragon leapt several feet in the air and stomped around looking around his feet. Where? Where are the spiders? This time it was Knick who paused to stare at the dragon in disbelief. You are afraid of spiders? But the dragon was still circling his little nest of a bed. There arent any spiders here. I killed this huge one on my way into your lair. I  it was a guardian sent by you. Of course not! Huffed the dragon as he settled back down, though his eyes kept darting around the ground. Filthy things, he said as he gave a small shudder. How big was this spider you fought? The dragon eyed Knick skeptically. Oh it was at least the size of a dog! Knick said as he held his hands two feet apart. I had just overcome this savage, thorned shrubbery that almost took my sword and my  Knick continued to recount his trek in a theatrical tone as the dragon nodded along and added Oh yes, and, Oh, Im sure and then, How dreadful, with a few nods and eye rolls in there. ... and then I found myself here and since you are awake and ... alive, I suppose I am ready for your riddles. Knick stood up tall with his hands on his waist, ready for another challenge. What riddles? The dragon stopped picking at his claws to look at Knick. You know? The riddles that you challenge me to solve and if I get all correct I get your hoard of treasure, Knick gestured to the mounds of gold, ... Those riddles. Knicks chest deflated at the blank look the dragon gave him. Then the dragon threw back his massive head and roared in booming laughter that bounced off the cavern walls and echoed throughout the massive chamber creating a cacophony of laughing beasts. You think, the dragon managed to get out between chortles, you think I would just you all of ? I would just  a  worth of treasure the dragon was gasping for breath as another bout of laughter hit him. Just because you answer some riddles that I already know the answers to? The dragon huffed as he composed himself once more. Honestly you knights are becoming worse and worse, expecting things to just be over to you. He gave a small chuckle. Just for some riddles, he muttered and shook his head. Ridiculous. Knick had composed himself from the indignant response and raised his sword towards the beast and said proudly, Then I shall vanquish you! You foul-smelling beast! Then I shall take these riches to the king! Preposterous! Huffed the dragon as he settled further into his nest of coins, not in the least bit worried about the weapon. You dont think I could take you? I have been training for decades for this very moment! Knick got into a fighting stance but stayed where he was. No, I mean preposterous that I smell.  have actually bathed in the past day. Though I doubt  could say the same, the dragon waved a claw in front of his snout. Besides, what were you intending to do once youve slain me, eh? Carry out all this gold in your many hidden pockets? He chuckled, eyeing the knights armour. Whats your armour for anyway? Protection, obviously. Knick gestured to his plated armour. From what, exactly? My teeth and claws will pierce that easily, and against my flames- itll only make you cook faster, albeit more evenly, inside all that metal. Knick swallowed audibly then gave a smirk, At least  not afraid of spiders! Humpf, the dragon huffed indignantly, giving off a puff of black smoke through his nostrils. Well, you seem a little  to still be a knight. Youre what? 50? Knick stood up straighter, I am 45, not that it matters! Age only comes with wisdom! And a bad knee, joked the dragon. You know its not disgraceful to hang up your sword. If youve truly spent all your life training for knighthood, perhaps its time for a change. Before its too late and you cant even walk. Go out and have an adventure! A safe adventure. Get married, ha! Theres an adventure. Have children to raise and pass on your wisd-... to pass on your sword. What about you? Youre older than me, obviously."" The dragon snorted at that. ""What are you doing here? Knick had sheathed his sword and started pacing. I like shinies, replied the dragon sheepishly. Then he cleared his throat and said seriously, I was tasked with guarding this trove many eons ago. The legends of the dragon-guarded treasure is  the dragon faded off and sighed deeply. Perhaps I am in need of a change as well. And get married? Asked Knick jokingly. The dragon gave a roar of laughter at that. That might be too much of an adventure for me. The dragon eyed Knick in his armour. Why are you a knight? Ive always been a knight, Knick answered and sat down heavily on a small pile of coins. Its my whole life. My identity. I dont know what I would do if I wasnt a knight. Well, what do you enjoy doing? The dragon asked patiently. The knight sat there on the mound of gold and questioned his passions in life. I love to garden, he admitted. Watching the little flowers grow, and being responsible for their care. It feels so rewarding. The dragon looked skeptical of the knight taking on the responsibility of living things but didnt question him. I mean, Ive only managed to grow some flowers on purpose a few years back. But  maybe I can learn? He asked looking up to the golden eyes before him. The dragon gave a knowing, and rather toothy, smile and sighed as he stood up. Gardening sounds like a great path for you. It might take some work. Starting a new career path at your age, or any age really, can seem daunting. Overwhelming even. It can feel like a real leap of faith. Unlike that leap you took to reach this cavern. The knight smiled and flushed. Come, said the dragon as he turned and walked towards, what Knick realized, was a massive cave mouth just around the corner from where they were sitting. Theres a door to this place? The knight asked incredulously. Its how most knights come in to challenge me for the treasure, chuckled the dragon. They walked slowly towards the mouth of the mountain, the stalactites forming teeth waiting to devour the next knight to dare enter the lair. What about you, asked Knick. What are you going to do? I plan to retire, said the dragon as he shuffled along the dirty ground, now clear of coins. I have been guarding this trove for decades, perhaps centuries now. The thing about holding onto your treasures too tightly, is you get rather lonely. These coins and jewels were nice for a while, but I think I shall fly north to the mountains to find others of my kind. That sounds peaceful. Easier than trying to start a new job path. Growing plants sounded great at first, but I am not sure I can handle the change. If you plant your roots in the idea of change and learn how to absorb the nutrients of knowledge and experience, then I know you will grow into something worthwhile. The knight turned, dumbfounded, towards the dragon and gestured down to his body, I dunno I think Ive grown as much as I will. The beast gave another rumbling roar of laughter as the dragon and knight walked out of the cave together, ready to face change."
Goddess of Joy,"She stared at the crowd. Bustling and shoving, everyone had their own life. Here she stood, or sat, every day, waiting. And waiting. And waiting.Waiting for who, or what, no-one knows. Many see her everyday asthey pass, but none speak.That day, as she sat on an old bench, an officer approached her.He was new and had seen her sit there for the past month, before leaving to whoknows where. She never got on the train.""Miss, what are you doing ?"" he asked. He wore aclassic blue uniform and had black hair and eyes.""I am waiting."" she replied in what was once a silkyvoice, but now raspy. Her hair had threads of white showing but were otherwiseblack too. Her eyes, a chocolate brown, looked as if they could shoot death rays.""What are you waiting for ?"" he asked.""Does nature need a reason to grow ?"" she asked back.The officer shook her head.""Then you have your answer."" she smiled warmly at himand turned back to stare at the train.But the man didn't leave.""May I join you ?"" he asked instead. She nodded,""If you wish.""They sat there for many hours; the guard got up occasionally todo a perimeter check.At exactly five minutes to midnight, she left. The guard's shifthad finished a little while ago and he followed her.She cut through town and went into the forest.With practiced ease, she travelled further and further awayuntil eventually, the guard lost her.He turned back and headed home.The next day, when he returned to the station for his shift, hesaw the woman back at her seat. Not a single hair was out of place.That night, he followed her again, however, this time, he keptclose. She never turned back, not once.But again, he lost her. She had disappeared and he was leftalone in a clearing.Again, he went back home and returned to work the next day.He worked up the courage to ask her, ""Where do you go atnight ?"" She stared at the trains, and he thought perhaps she had notheard him.""Home."" she didn't look at him as she said it, but hecould see it saddened her.That night, he did not follow her. Instead, he went straighthome and had dinner with his family.That very night, the woman sat in her little cave deep in theforest, wondering when her son would return. She pondered on that thought deepinto the night.As the sun rose, she too, got up. Shesighed. When would her son come home ? They could not banish her on Earthforever. The gods would take her back. And when they did, she would be waiting.Until then, she would simply spend her days at the station. Shewould find no joy in life, not until she was back.he scoffed. She thought back to all those people who wished theywere happy, and she helped them. She worked in mysterious ways.But the truth was, she didn't do anything. It was her name - herstatus - that made people believe. She simply showed them the right path.At that moment, she wished she could help herself. But whycouldn't she ? She did not need fake beliefs to help her earn her life back.And why would she want her old life anyway, when she couldcreate a new identity ? Start over ?What was it humans said . . . turn over a new leaf ?Why couldn't she do that ? It was clear she was not wanted. Shegot up, breaking her ritual that she had been following for years, and steppedout into the sun. she thought, asthe sun warmed her face.She walked around and found herself at a market. She saw smilingfaces and returned their smiles. Her eyes warmed, and she felt accomplished.Proud. . . . Happy.Meanwhile, back at the station, the guard was angry. How darethey! The gods had promised not to take her back, so why is she not here ?He huffed. She had promised happiness but had never gotten any. She broke her promise. And now, he seeked revenge. Never again would he trust anyone. He would never smile until she was gone.The Goddess of Joy, walked around, complimenting peoples work and arrived home early. She was tired.But as she was about to enter, she heard a sharp whine. A wolf. She ran into her cave. Goddess or not, she didnt like wolves. The whine came again, this time more . . . painful. It was hurt. She heard another howl, a bark, and she could tell the wolf was in trouble.She ran back out, following the sounds and letting the forest show her the way. She broke out into a large clearing and there she saw it. It was beautiful. It had grey-ish blue-ish fur and small beady eyes.The other wolves were circling it.She took a deep breath and let out a piercing whistle. The other wolves whined and ran off. The injured wolf remained on the floor.She didnt approach slowly but ran to it. Her hands leaked a golden colour, and she placed them above the wolfs ribs. Then, she moved them to its foot.The wolf remained still, and she hoped she wasnt too late.She wasnt about to give up. She carried the wolf  it was very young, perhaps a day old  and took it into her cave. She fed it food and water and again, let her hands glow.She forced all the magic out of her, pouring out of her fingertips, and into the wolf. It opened an eye. I will call you, Happy. She took Happy out for a walk up the hill in which her cave hid. She looked out at the forest, and its transition into a town, trailing her fingers in Happy's fur. LIFE IS NOT ABOUT HAPPINESS, BUT ABOUT EARNING HAPPINESS. YOUDON'T NEED MONEY TO BE HAPPY, YOU NEED TO TRUST YOURSELF - AND BELIEVE.-inspired by Reedsy Prompts : )"
Dark World,"The train started moving. I was on my way to see my uncle and aunt. They were our countries most respected people. I'm going to visit them because they said they had bought a new car and wanted me to see it. I was big into automobiles. They just fascinated me. How the pistons moved, how the combustions exploded inside the engine, they all excites me. I hurriedly took my seat. In front, sat a little girl with a pretty red dress. She looked about 5, or 6. She was holding a little teddy bear that was worn out. The train started to move and we both sat in silence. It wasn't weird, for it was a custom in our country. Staying silent was respectful for both the elderly and the minors. As time went on, the little girl started to hum our anthem song. ""Shine bright, you dawn, on this land so fair,"" she started to sing. She had a lovely voice. It was a voice you could listen forever and ever and never get tired of it. ""The country of three thousand ri,So rich in silver and in gold you are, Five thousand years your history."" By this time, she was singing loudly. I looked around, and saw that the elderly approved. They were humming the song themselves also. ""Our people ever were renowned and sage,And rich in cultural heritage, And as with heart and soul we strive,Korea shall forever thrive!"" She started to gain confidence in her singing. By this time, everyone was singing along. And before I knew it, I was singing too. ""And in the spirit of MountPaektu,With love of toil that shall never die, With will of iron fostered by the truth, We'll lead the whole world by and by."" This time, even the conductor was singing along. ""We have the might to foil the angry sea, Our land more prosperous still shall be, As by the people's will we strive, Korea shall forever thrive!"" We all chanted as the song ended.	We all looked at each other and smiled. We had pride in our country. Then it was silence again. Some elderly were humming the anthem quietly, but most of the part, everyone stayed silent. I looked out the window. Green, pink, purple, brown, and blue whizzed by. If you didn't guess what country I represent, I proudly present you, North Korea. My family is from a wealthy family line, so I can afford to take the train to Pyongyang anytime I wanted to. I looked at the girl. She had a smile, but I could tell her mind was on something else. Gathering up confidence, I asked her, ""Do you have something in your mind?"" She looked at me, nodding her head. ""Our country is so beautiful. But the outside world thinks we ar-"" I cut her off. ""Our country will always be prosperous."" She shakes her head no. ""I want to believe that, but look! There are little kids starving, look at their rib cages."" she said. I thought about it, and looked outside. Indeed there were starving children. And I knew, in the inside, our government was cruel. I have been to abroad many times, and every time, the outsiders would say, ""North Korea is probably scary and dark. Nobody in their right minds would go there."" And they would laugh. So I knew it was true. Our country was a hermit land. Even our enemies, the Americans, were ready to kill all of us in an instant. 	I looked at the little girl. She understood what I was thinking and nodded. Tears were flowing from her eyes. Our country wasn't what it was years ago. It was starting to fall apart.  I looked outside, but kept seeing green, pink, purple, brown, and blue. It was quite sunny that day. I saw little children playing ball in the fields, I saw farmers gathering food for the day. It was hard to believe that our world, my world was dark and cold. The birds chirping, the leaves rustling, and the smell of nectar from the flowers. It was hard to believe that my world had no light. I went to America to study, and one of the maps they had was the whole world, with lights. It showed all of earth and every country had lights except for mine. I asked the teacher why there wasn't any lights in North Korea, and everyone laughed. ""Well, it is an undeveloped country, and the government is probably hoarding all of the electricity, if there is any. North Korea is not a pretty place, its just a dark, lonely place that happens to be a part of land."" Then the teacher laughed. So I knew, from outsiders, our country is not the most beautiful place in the world. I kept looking out the window. Why, why cant our country show our natural beauty? It is beautiful. The green scenery, the buzzing of variety of insects.  It was as beautiful as any other countries. 	The train screeched to a stop. 4 soldiers came inside. They were looking around. I beamed. My dream and goal was to become the top general and govern along with our great leader. But something was off with these soldiers. They looked mad. 2 of them had a rifle in their hands, and the other 2 had revolvers. They looked right at me. My heart was beating fast. Sweat started to pour down. And they reached out their hands, I closed my eyes. But, the hands didn't grab me. They had grabbed the little girl. ""This girl has betrayed all of you! She has been sending people to other countries! It is an illegal activity, and she has betrayed our country! She is a traitor to you and me! Her consequences will be death!"" One of the soldier shouted. Him and the others went out. The girl was screaming and yelling. One of the soldiers with the pistol got in position. He cocked the gun and aimed. The gun now only had a cloud of smoke coming out. And lying next to him, a dead body that once belonged to a little girl. My eyes widened, and I didn't breathe. The greenery, the pink, purple, blue. It was all gone. The only colors that I saw were red. Dark red. Death is what I saw. The soldiers came back in. ""If you try to do what that little girl tried to do, you all will meet the same fate!!!"" He shouted. Everyone nodded, some even cheering. But I couldn't. My world was turned upside down. 	I had exactly another hour till I reached my uncles. I had closed the blinders so that I could not see the dark world of mine. ""Pyongyang in 20 minutes! Those who need to leave, please get ready!"" The intercom commanded. In my head, I was only thinking, ""is this another plan of yours to kill all of us?"" I wasn't eager to see the new car anymore. I was scared. I looked at my watch. Only 5 more minutes. I decided to take a one last glance of passing nature. I opened the blinds, and was almost blinded by the sunlight. At that moment, my fears, anxiety, worrisome was gone. The land was beautiful. The lakes, the mountains, the trees along with the birds of the air. It was breathtaking. I wanted to stay and look all day. But alas, the intercom interrupted my moment. ""Those who are arriving to Pyongyang, please leave. I repeat, those arriving to Pyongyang, please leave."" I got up, took my bags and walked out. I took a deep breath in and exhaled. The world I live may have bad people, bad ideas, and bad intentions. But the world I live still has some beauty left. We were not all hopeless. We still have hope."
The Cheeky Possum and the Bush Fire Triangle,"Possum was sunning himself on a branch enjoying a ray of the winter sun. He rubbed his furry belly as the suns warmth coated him like a blanket. Just as he was about to stretch and go to sleep, a lizard rushed passed. Possum turned over onto his four feet and chased Lizard along the branch wondering what he was in such a hurry for.Lizard, he said, whats the rush? Why have you climbed so high up the tree? Are you ok? Can I help? Are you in danger?Lizard stopped and as he turned to Possum, he was puffing so hard. Lizards dont often climb up trees, and this tree was tall. He said to Possum, Do you have to ask so many questions? Its no wonder why your called Cheeky Possum.Possum was called cheeky because he would ask too many questions. But he believed that you dont learn anything if you dont ask questions. So he asked Lizard again why he was up a tree?There is a fire over at Billabong Valley and everyone is running this way., said Lizard.Possum couldnt believe it as he hadnt smelt the smoke as yet. Everyone knows smoke is a warning sign that there is a fire somewhere. Possum quickly ran up the rest of the tree to look over to Billabong Valley and sure enough, there was thick smoke rising up.Ooohhhh said Possum, this is not good. Lizard, that is where there is a lot of undergrowth and old litter on the ground. We have also been having very dry and hot days and the wind is dry too.Lizard looked at Possum as if he had lost his mind. Lizard jumped up and down and shouted, What are you talking about Possum? There is a fire and you are worried about the heat, the ground litter and the wind?No, said Possum, its the fire triangle. Fire needs equal parts of litter, oxygen that the wind blows and heat from a hot day. Billabong Valley has not been looked after by the human fire brigade for a long time, so all the dry grass, fallen trees and old leaves have built up over time.Lizard looked over at the smoke rising and said Oh! So how does the human fire brigade stop it from happening again?Every year they do small fires in the bush to keep the litter down, so if a fire does happen, its not a big one, said Possum, This one is going to be a big, but if they hurry, they can stop it quickly.So, said Lizard, how does that triangle work again?Possum sat down on the highest branch next to Lizard so they could keep an eye on the smoke and said, A fire wont spread if theres not enough dead litter on the ground and if the ground is wet. Hot days dry the ground very fast and when a human walks away from their camp fire or barbeque, the fire can spread easily on the hot dry ground. Then Lizard, if the wind blows up, it makes the fire spread very, very fast, which makes it worse for us animals. That is the fire triangle.Just then Possum and Lizard saw the human fire brigade drive past their tree.  It was the Turkey Ridge Rural Fire Brigade and all the fire fighters are volunteers.  Possum put Lizard on his back and they jumped from tree top to tree top following the the crew as they drove to the fire.  ""Don't get too close Possum"", said Lizard, ""I don't want to get smoke in my lungs"".""No Lizard, we'll stay a long way from them, but we can still see what they are doing"", replied Possum.Possum saw that Fire Fighter Marry -Anne was driving the big yellow truck full of water to the fire.  She was driving really carefully as the ground has lots of sticks that could blow a tire or she could drive into an old tree log covered over with long grass and vines.First Officer Brigalow Bill was in the front passenger seat guiding Marry-Anne with a map of the surrounding valleys and hills.  As the fire crew, Possum and Lizard got closer, they saw all the animals running for their lives away from the fire.Mrs. Mouse had her six babies, Mr. Emu was running with Mrs. Emu and their eggs, Mrs. Maggie Magpie picked up her nest of Magpie chicks and flew far away and Mr. Slither the snake had so many insects on his back he had to go slowly so they all stayed on.  Possum and Lizard stopped at a tree top whilst they watched the Turkey Ridge crew bravely drive to the fire to put it out.the truck had barely stopped when Fire Fighter Jones, nicknamed Jonesy, jumped out of the truck yelling ""I'll get the hose"".  Second Officer Prickly Pear shouted he'd man the water pump, First Officer said he'll radio Firecom that they have arrived.  The bushland was all of a sudden full of human noises from all the shouting, the truck's engine, the radio chatter and the water hitting the fire.  Lizard had never seen anything like it, it was just so busy, noisy, exciting and exhausting to watch.""What are they doing Possum?"" asked Lizard.  Possum looked surprised and said, ""Oh, so now you ask a question?  Well Lizard, the water we drink is what humans use to put a fire out.  Remember the fire triangle we talked about before, fire doesn't like water.""""But water will make it all wet Possum"", said Lizard.""That's right"" replied Possum, ""The humans have to make everything really wet to break the fire triangle.  So, that truck can carry 1600 liters of water to put on any fire humans can get to.  That's how humans fight fires, with water and lots of it.  When they make everything soaked, the fire can't keep going because it's not dry anymore.""As Lizard's eyes widened with understanding, he put a stubby paw to his chin and said, ""Ah, now I understand.  Fire needs a hot, dry day with dry litter but, water cools things down and makes everything wet"".Possum patted Lizard proudly on the back and with a smile, said, ""That's right Lizard"".Just then First Officer Brigalow Bill shouted, ""All right crew, looks like it's out.  Let's go along the wet line once more and make sure all the fire is out and can't start again"".""Well, that's it Lizard, we can go home now.  What do you think?"" said Possum.""Yes please Possum"" said a very tired Lizard.So, Possum put Lizard on his back and went through the tree tops again back to their home."
Her Last Bedtime Story,"Im afraid she doesnt have much time left.The doctors words echo through my mind all the way down to the hollow pit in my stomach. Guilt and the death of hope feel like hands pressed around my throat, suffocating me. Im here now, 15 years too late and not an ounce of the man I ought to be, but Im here. On borrowed time.He excuses himself and leaves the room. I turn towards my daughter.Hey, thanks for coming. My ex-wife says, but what she really means is After all this time, I still know how to interpret her words.Thanks for telling me. Is what I reply, but she can tell that what Im actually saying is My little girl is a grown woman now, with 25 years behind her. I cant bear the sight of her lying still on a hospital bed but I also cant tear my eyes away. Shes still got my nose. The years may have taken her baby fat, I recall fondly, but not that. I feel the hot stain of tears over my cheeks.My ex-wife, Mary, places a hand on my shoulder. Ill be in the cafeteria. Do you want anything?I shake my head and she leaves.I sit on the chair next to the bed and take my daughters hand in mine. An hour passes by with me just staring at her face  a face I havent seen in so long, the face I see in my dreams. Why hadnt I come to her sooner? I close my eyes. The truth is, I had hoped shed seek me out, offer me forgiveness and tell me her life wouldnt be complete without me in it. But I knew it was always up to me. Shame overcame my judgment. I have been a coward for all these years and now this is my final punishment.DadI look up to meet warm brown eyes, the same shade as Marys.Fresh tears stream down my face. Ana!I rise to kiss her forehead. Dad, youre here. She says weakly.Yes, I...I I swallow the sob rising in my throat. Sweetheart, Im so sorry.Ana manages a sad smile. I was expecting you.I cup her cheek. Im here. Dads here.She places her other hand over mine and thats when I notice the engagement ring. I have a lot to say. I dont haveI sit and stare at her hand. ...much time, I know.A wave of pain crashes over me at this little detail. My baby girl...was supposed to get married. Have a wedding. Lose my last name. Would she have asked me to give her away at the ceremony? Would she have invited me in the first place? Regardless, shell never be a bride now.Yes. Ive accepted that. Really, I have. But dad, I still have to tell you that I love you. I love you and Im sorry and I missed youShes just like her mother. What shes actually saying is .I take a deep breath. Did I ever tell you about the story of the Castle in the Air?She blinks, a confused look on her face. I...yes, its my favorite. But dad Im not done talkingHumor me for a sec, will ya? She remains silent. Once upon a time, there was a little princess who lived in a castle made out of clouds. It was paradise. The walls tasted like cotton candy, and the view was spectacular. Everyday she would look down at all the people living on land and wonder what life was like for them. One day she leaned too far out the window and fell from the sky.Ana has a coughing fit so I stand and get her a glass of water.I already know this story by heart. Please, let me say what I need to while I still can.But Im a coward trying to run from that word. I dont want to hear it. Not now, not yet.I think we both need to hear this story again. So let me finish and then you can talk all you want, okay? She nods slowly.So the little princess fell to the earth. Specifically, on a farm owned by a middle aged couple. The farmer and his wife have been childless for years and have always prayed for a miracle. And then on one sunny afternoon, their prayers were answered. Joseph, the farmer, noticed a hole on the roof of their stable. He went in to investigate the damage and found the little princess sleeping soundly on the hay. The girl looked to be about 7 years old, without any knowledge regarding her parents and how she ended up in their stable. When asked where she lived, she would only point to the sky. The husband and wife took her into their home. They thought about the situation for hours and finally decided that if no one comes to claim the girl, then she must be Gods little gift to them. Months passed with the three of them living happily together. Still, no stranger came knocking on their door for the child. The princess was given a name. Do you remember what name they gave her?Ana. Same as mine. She smiles softly and yawns.Thats right, sweetheart. Say, when was the last time you heard this story anyway?Ana bites her lip. The night of my 10th birthday. I nod and continue. Ana, Joseph, and Mary spent several years on the farm. In that time, the memory of the castle in the air slowly faded from the princesss memory and she grew up as a normal human girl. She learned to live, laugh, and love as they do. She experienced things that didnt exist up in the clouds such as pain, frustration, and fear. Despite that, she was happy. But soon her parents became very old and weak. Eventually they withered and their bodies returned to the earth. Ana was left alone again, in her house made of wood and brick. She wondered if goodbye meant forever. This was her final lesson in life  loss. She often visited the place where her parents were buried and cried. Their bodies lay deep underground, somewhere she could not follow...but was that all humans were made of? She looked to the sky and did as her mother and father had taught her. She prayed.Ana lets herself be carried away to the land of dreams and peace. I study her for a moment. All at once, the memories come to me. So many nights tucking her in, watching her drift into sleep. A lot of her has changed but somehow, she is still the same. My little girl. I take her hand again and kiss it gently.She prayed to be reunited with them someday. Not knowing how it would be possible, but carrying hope in her heart nonetheless. And one day, her prayer was answered. Ana, too, passed away and was buried next to Joseph and Marys grave. But luckily, bodies are only a temporary part of who we are. Their souls met again in that castle in the air, where the walls tasted like cotton candy, and the view could take one's breath away. There, they were safe from the worlds pain and fear and loss. There, they had each other.I let my tears fall and land on her palm. Just as I can tell what shes thinking and feeling, I hope she can do the same for me. I hope she knows that with all that Ive said, what I really meant was..."
Stopped By The Sun,"The sun is bright. Its got a lot of light. So much so, it lights up our whole world. It also lights up the other worlds that orbit it. It brings more life to our planet than any other in our galaxy. And at night, when the sun goes to sleep, if we look up in the sky, we can see billions of other suns giving life to what could be millions of other Earths. Its beautiful. But its also sad.	Its sad because one day, when you and I are long gone, and the people we know and love cease to exist, the sun will go dark. When the sun goes, so will our Earth. And so will the other planets that neighbor our Earth. Our home will no longer be our home. The life we lived wont matter. And everything we ever were, and all the good weve ever tried doing, will be forgotten by the universe. Its inevitable. But its life.	Now, Im not telling you this to scare you. Thats the last thing I want to do. Im telling you this so that every morning when you wake up and open your curtains to welcome the sun, youre reminded to live your life as best as you can. Dont let the falls that make you bleed, the people that make you hurt, the politics that try to govern your life, take any part of living away from you. Make your life your own.	I reached into my sleeping daughter's crib and brushed the small wisp of hair that was sticking straight up on the top of her head. I smiled as I caressed her cheek and leaned down to kiss her head.	I love you so much, I whispered.	I stood back upright, picked my work bag up off the floor and slung it over my left shoulder, and started for her bedroom door. As I reached for the knob, I heard a faint whimper start from my daughters crib. I turned my head back and smiled.	Youre supposed to be asleep, nugget.	I walked back over to the crib and looked down at her once again. Her eyes were still closed, but her whimpers were starting to turn into a cry. I glanced at the princess clock that perched on the edge of her changing table. It read .	Ive got some time, babygirl, I said, unwrapping her bright pink swaddle.	I pulled the swaddle off of my daughter and was treated to the cutest little baby stretches youd ever seen. Followed by a grunt and one or two little baby toots. My smile grew.	I picked up the little burrito filling and rested her head on my shoulder, and walked with her downstairs to the kitchen. By the time Id reached the bottom step, she was almost awake, gripping the sleeves of my shirt like if she let go shed fall. Id never let that happen. Rubbing her back to comfort her, I made it to the kitchen and started digging through the cabinets for a clean bottle.	After a few tries, I found one hidden in the back of one of the cabinets behind a few miscellaneous baby toys wed kept there just to keep out of the way. I filled the bottle with milk, warmed it up, and started feeding her. The kitchen light started flickering.	, I thought to myself as I made my way back upstairs.	By the time I reached the top, the bottle was almost empty and the kid was almost back to sleep. You have your dads appetite, nugget. I chuckled to myself.	Before I laid her back down, I placed her back on my shoulder and patted her back. She burped twice, then, pushing herself up with one hand and using the other, rubbed her eyes. Time to go back to sleep.	I laid her back down on the swaddle and wrapped her into the cutest little burrito I ever made. Her eyes were shut tight and the only movement she made was from her soft breathing.	Okay nugget, I glanced at the princess clock again; , daddy has to go work. I made sure her night light was still on and securely plugged into the wall. Making sure my bag was still strapped to my shoulder, I made my way to the door again. Slowly, I pulled the door open, walked out, and closed it with the knob still turned so it wouldnt click when it shut. I put my ear up to the door and listened for any more baby noises.	When I was sure she was fully asleep, I walked across the hall to kiss my wife one more time. I didnt make it. From the babys room, I heard soft whimpers quickly turn into a full cry. Not wanting to wake up my wife, I quickly walked back in to check on her. The smell lingering above her crib was rancid.	Uh-oh! I exclaimed, unwrapping the stinky burrito again, I shouldve checked your diaper, huh?	The cries quickly turned into laughing as I undid her onesie and opened up her diaper. I pulled my shirt up over my nose, Oh, you think this is funny, dont you? Well, you wait until you have to change your own babys diaper, Heaven forbid. Thinking about her all grown up was already starting to make me emotional.	I quickly changed her diaper--holding both legs tightly as she tried kicking whenever Id go to wipe--re-buttoned her onesie, and swaddled her back up. I rocked her in my arms until eventually she went back to sleep. I smiled again.	Okay nugget, this time you have to stay asleep. I glanced at the clock again. . Yeah, daddy definitely has to get going, sweetheart. I kissed her one time and made a stealthy escape back into the hallway.	I made my way across the hall and into my own bedroom where my wife was dead asleep, drooling off the side of the bed. I kissed her forehead, avoiding the sleepy saliva, and made my way back downstairs to the front door. I twisted the lock and was about to step out when I heard it again.	Id just seen how asleep my wife was and didnt know how long the burrito would have to cry before the sleep-zombie finally woke up. My heart started to ache just thinking about it. I sighed and made my way back inside, dropping my bag at the door, and back up the stairs to the babys room.	I looked at the clock as soon as I opened the door. Okay, maam, Im already late for work. Whats the matter?	I stood over her crib and was welcomed by a warm smile and a very awake baby. I picked her up, this time leaving her in her wrap, and started rocking her. My daughter looked up at me, smiling wide and giggling softly. I couldnt help but giggle back.	Isnt this supposed to sooth you back to sleep? Those baby books lied, I joked.	I sat myself down in the rocking chair in the corner of the room and picked up one of the books wed started reading to her the night before to get her sleep.	, I read the title aloud. Hmm, reminds me of someone I know.	The nugget giggled again.	I started reading the book. Page one. Then quickly to page two. Then page three. Then.  	Honey? I jerked my head up, confused	and disoriented. Why arent you at work?	I shook my head and looked around the room until my eyes came across my wife standing in front of me. The baby kept waking up. I wanted you to sleep. I looked down to make sure I was still holding my daughter. I was. Her eyes were shut tight and the only movement she made was from her soft breathing.	I glanced at the clock again. .	The sun was peeking through the blinds, lighting up half of the room. I stood up from the rocking chair and walked over to the crib. I gently put her down, kissed her one more time and said, Good morning, Aurora."
The Tail Of Aslaug,"Once upon a time, there lived a hulder girl named Aslaug. Like all other hulders, Aslaug looked like a human from the front, but she had the tail of a cow and a large, gaping hole in her back like one would find in a hollow oak tree or a rotten log. Hulders were gifted with superhuman strength, shapeshifting abilities, and immunity to fire. They lived deep inside forests and mountains. As such, they were quite knowledgeable when it came to what grew in nature. They knew which berries were poisonous and which were safe to eat, they knew which herbs to use to treat ailments and illnesses, and they knew which flowers made for great tea.	Aslaug loved playing with her fellow hulders of the Wolfwood Forest, but now she was the only one left. Even her parents were with her no more. And as time went on, she became increasingly lonely. She became more and more curious about the tiny human village on the other side of the bridge outside the forest. Every day for an entire month, she would climb a tree near the bridge and look across at the human village. She saw the birthday celebrations they threw, the festivals they held, and the games they played with one another. To Aslaug, it looked like they were having so much fun. She had wanted to visit the village since she was a little girl, but her father forbade her from doing so.	Why cant I visit the human village, Father? Aslaug had asked her father one day while they were filleting a fish.	Because the humans wont accept you, her father said. I went to that village before. One look at my tail and they called me a troll. Her father snorted. Trolls hated hulders, finding their ethereal beauty repulsive. Hulders werent particularly fond of trolls either. I tried telling them I wasnt what they thought I was, but it didnt matter. Once they made up their minds, they were impossible to change. So dont go to the human village, alright?	Yes, Father, Aslaug said obediently.	But time went on like it always did, and Aslaug found it increasingly hard to obey her fathers words. She was lonely and she yearned for companionship. She couldnt stand being alone any longer. So, one day, she decided to leave the forest for the first time and go to the human village to make friends with the villagers.	It was early in the afternoon when Aslaug arrived in the human village. The marketplace was in full swing. She approached a red-haired woman trying to drag her goat with her. The goat had its hooves firmly planted in the dirt, refusing to budge a single inch.	Come on, you stupid goat! The woman yelled.	Hello! Aslaug smiled warmly. The woman looked up at Aslaug. My name is Aslaug. I just came from the Wolfwood Forest and I	T-Troll! The woman yelled, staggering back a step, her eyes wide with fright. She had noticed the long cow tail peeking out from the bottom of Aslaugs dress and dragging along the ground.	""I'm not a troll, I'm a hulder, Aslaug said.	The woman dropped the goats leash and ran away. Help! Troll!	""I'm not a troll!"" Aslaug called after the woman.	By now, some of the nearby villagers had heard the womans cries and looked over at Aslaug. Their eyes widened in fright.	Troll! They yelled. Troll!	Aslaug watched as the marketplace turned into complete chaos. Mothers scooped up their children. Merchants quickly gathered up what was left of their wares. The only living thing in the marketplace that wasn't sent into a frenzy was the red-haired womans goat. It trotted over to Aslaug and bent his head towards her, like it wanted to be petted.	Aw, Aslaug cooed as she bent down a little to pet the crown of the goats head. Arent you the cutest little thing?	Look! Shes bewitched my goat! The red-haired woman cried out. Someone, stop her!	But I didnt Aslaug trailed off when she saw several of the villagers grabbing wood planks and firewood. They drew closer to Aslaug, brandishing their makeshift weapons at her.	Leave! They yelled. Youre not welcome here!	Aslaug stared at them. UmIll just come back another time. She turned around and walked away.	Aslaug could tell the villagers werent receptive towards her. But she wasnt going to give up that easily. She was going to win them over by proving she wasnt a threat and that she wanted to be friends with them.	Be kind to everyone, even if they dont deserve it, Aslaugs mother told her one night while she was brushing through Aslaugs long hair. Always do the right thing even if your kindness goes unappreciated.	Yes, Mother, Aslaug said obediently.	The next day, Aslaug put her plan into work. She went down to the docks where there were several men hard at work putting together a boat, their brows slick with sweat.	 Hello! She smiled as she approached the men. Can I lend a hand?	Its the troll! One of the builders cried out. Everyones heads snapped towards Aslaug.	Im not a troll,"" Aslaug said. ""But I  pretty strong so I can help lift things. She demonstrated her strength by lifting a long wooden beam with one hand.	D-Drop that! Another one of the builders said. We dont want your help! Just leave us alone!	But Im trying to help you, Aslaug said.	Leave us! Yeah, leave us! We dont want you here! The rest of the builders joined in with their protests.	Aslaug looked at their faces. They were full of fear and anger.	Well, it seems like you guys have everything under control so Ill just...come back another time. Aslaug gently put down the wooden beam and walked away.	Aslaug made a second attempt the following day. This time she went to the edge of the forest down the river where there were some women picking berries.	Hello! Aslaug greeted them with a smile.	The women turned their heads towards Aslaug. They gasped in fright, dropping the berries in their hands.	I have some wild mountain berries you guys can use. Aslaug moved her long hair over her shoulder and reached behind herself to pull a bag from out of the hole in her back. She held it out in front of her. I picked them myself since they only grow at the top of the mountain.	S-S-Stay away from us! A woman cried out. W-We dont want your berries!	Are you sure? Aslaug said. They taste really good. You should try them.	Stay away! Yeah, stay away! Leave us alone! The rest of the women joined in with their protests.	Aslaug looked at their faces. They were full of fear and anger.	UhWell, I guess you guys have all the berries you need, so Ill just leave then. Aslaug stuck the bag of berries back in the hole in her back and walked away.	Aslaug still wasnt deterred by the treatment she experienced so far and made a third attempt the next day.	She went down to the Great Hall where everyone in the village was gathered. The musicians were playing a festive tune, and everyone was feasting and laughing and having a great time.	Aslaug walked through the front doors. Hello everyone! She called out.	The clamor of laughing and talking and plates and cups clinking died out immediately. Several people gasped. Even the musicians had stopped playing.	Its that troll girl again! Someone cried out.		I just wanted to	Why cant you just leave us alone? Someone else cried out.	But I just wanted to	We dont want any trolls around here!""	""But I already told you!"" Aslaug said. ""I'm not a troll, Im a hulder!	Dont try and fool us! Someone cried out. We can all see your tail!	But Im not a troll, Aslaug said.	Get out of here! We dont want any trolls around here! Yeah, get out! The people shouted at Aslaug. Soon enough, everyone in the hall had joined in.	Aslaug looked at their faces. They were full of fear of anger.	Oh, she said sadly. Then I guessIll just leave. She turned around and walked away.	Aslaug returned to the deep forest, upset. She didnt go back to the human village the next day, or the day after that, or even the day after that. She decided to give up on befriending the humans in the village. She thought if she showed enough kindness to humans, they would eventually start liking her. But her mother was wrong. And her father was right. Not everyone deserved kindness. And she wouldnt step a foot back in the human village ever again.	A week after Aslaugs last visit to the human village, she was walking through the forest at night when she suddenly heard distant screams in the distance. Confused, she climbed the nearest tree and looked towards the human village.	There were seven trolls attacking the human village, rounding up the villagers that were screaming and running for their lives. The trolls had rope and were using it to tie up the captured villagers. One troll was lugging a giant pot with him. The villagers would be made into stew soon.	Aslaug's mothers words rang through her mind. 	Aslaug couldnt leave the villagers to get eaten by trolls. Even if the way they treated Aslaug was less than ideal, if she let them get eaten by trolls, then the villagers would be right to call her one.	Aslaug climbed down the tree and raced back to her familys longhouse. She pulled up one of the floorboards near her mother's bed and pulled out her mothers potions book. She turned to a worn page and read over the list of ingredients for a particular potion; most of the ingredients she needed were already in the longhouse and the rest she could easily find in the forest on her way to the human village.Aslaug stuffed the ingredients in the longhouse into a bag which she stuck in the hole in her back. She stuck her mothers potions book in there as well before she changed out of her dress and put on her fathers favorite dark green tunic and trousers. She returned to the forest and finished gathering all the ingredients she needed for the potion. She raced to the human village as fast as her legs could carry her.Before she crossed the bridge, Aslaug stopped and transformed herself into an old man, changing her black hair to grey and growing a long, grey beard. She bent down and scooped up some dirt with both hands, rubbing it all over her clothes to disguise her hulder scent. She crossed the bridge and crept into the village under the thick cover of night.	 The trolls had set up camp in the village square and had a dozen screaming villagers roasting over two large fire pits. There was a troll at each fire pit, rotating the slowly-roasting villagers. Two trolls were tending to a huge pot of stew cooking over a fire while two others were sitting on the ground. One troll seemed to be supervising the rest. His left eye was missing and he was the meanest-looking out of all of them. The rest of the villagers were tied up, huddled around each other. Even from where she was, Aslaug could see them trembling. As she got closer to the village square, she could start making out the conversation the trolls were having.	We made a good little find tonight, boys! One of the trolls said. All these people, ours to gobble down!	I'll say, another one of the trolls said, licking his lips as he stared at the roasting villagers. I cant wait to sink me teeth into 'em.	Theres plenty of time till daylight,"" the one-eyed troll said. ""We ain't gunna rush.	Aslaug continued creeping forward and hid behind a low wall, just a stones throw from where the trolls were. She took the bag of ingredients and her mothers potions book out from the hole in her back and held both in either hand. She stood up and walked out from behind the wall into full view of the trolls.	She cleared her throat. My goodness! She exclaimed, lowering her voice to sound like her grandfathers. Whats going on here?	The trolls manning the fire pits and the trolls cooking the stew stopped and stared at Aslaug along with the rest of the trolls. The one-eyed troll pulled his upper lip back in a snarl. Eh, its just a shriveled ol' man. According to Aslaug's father, trolls didnt eat the elderly because they didnt like how they tasted. Keep it movin', old man, he told Aslaug. We dont have no business with you.	Ah, but you cant eat those villagers! Aslaug said as she walked forward. Not without some of my special seasoning!	Special seasoning? The one-eyed troll said.	Thats right! I regularly travel into forests and mountains to find rare ingredients. Its why Im so covered in dirt, as you can see. But its worth it to find the best ingredients to make the best stew you can eat on this side of the valley. I have some with me right now. Aslaug held the bag up in front of her. Normally, I charge a hefty fee for such precious ingredients, but since Im in a generous mood, you can have the bag for free right now!	Ooh, I want to try! One of the trolls said.	We ain't gunna wait for the first group to stop cookin'? Another one asked.	A little taste wont hurt, Aslaug said. It wont take long to mix the ingredients into the stew. I guarantee this will be the best stew you ever tasted!	Well The one-eyed troll thought about it for a moment. I suppose a wee taste couldnt hurt.	Excellent! Aslaug walked towards the pot of stew. The two trolls standing over it stepped back to give her some space. She opened her mothers potions book and turned to the worn page from earlier. The title read . Aslaug didnt have to hide the words since she knew trolls couldnt read.	The recipe isnt complicated, she said, but I like to take a quick look here and there to make sure I get the measurements right.	Aslaug followed along with the recipe, adding each ingredient to the stew as it was called for. After the last ingredient was thrown in, she grabbed the stirring spoon and stirred everything together. Once she was finished, she stepped back. Alright, its done!	All seven of the trolls went over to the pot. One of the trolls took a sniff. Oh my, that smells lovely, he said.Dont just stand there! Aslaug said. Take a sip!	The trolls grabbed their serving spoons and sampled the stew, smacking their lips loudly.	The one-eyed troll gasped in surprise. Blimey! This  the best stew Ive ever tasted!	The other trolls voiced their approval. They dipped their spoons back into the stew, taking several more samples. Seconds later, they all fell onto the ground, one by one, each with a massive thud.	Aslaug stuck her mothers potions book back into the hole in her back and transformed back into her regular form. The villagers stared in stunned silence as she went over to the fire pits and gathered up all the burning firewood in her hands, as well as the burning firewood underneath the pot of stew. She ran down to the river and threw the firewood into the water. She went back to the village square and searched the trolls for a filleting knife, which she found. She used the knife to cut through the ropes restraining the villagers tied up over the fire pits and released them onto the ground. She then went over to the villagers tied up together and cut the ropes around them. Soon enough, the entire village was free.I fed the trolls a sleeping potion so theyll be out for the rest of the night, Aslaug said. Once dawn comes, theyll turn into stone. You can chip away at their bodies with axes and do whatever you want with the stone afterwards.	She smiled at the villagers before she turned to walk away.	Wait! The red-haired woman with the goat said. Where are you going?	Back to the forest,"" Aslaug said.	You mean youre not going to stay around?	Aslaugs eyes widened in surprise. Youwant me to stay?	The red-haired woman looked ashamed. Im sorry for accusing you of bewitching my goat.	I'm sorry too for not accepting your help when building the boat, one of the builders said. The rest of the builders apologized too.	I'm sorry as well for not accepting the berries you offered to us, one of the berry-picking women said. The rest of the women apologized too. And I think I speak for everyone here when I say were sorry for running you out of the Great Hall.	Yeah, were sorry! Thanks for saving us! We would have been dead if it wasnt for you! The villagers said.	You dont have to stay in the village if you dont want to, the red-haired woman said, but could you at least stay until tomorrow for a feast in your honor for rescuing us?	Aslaug gasped. A feast? In my honor? Of course Ill stay!	The villagers cheered. Aslaug looked at their faces. They were full of joy and admiration.	.	Aslaugs kindness had finally been appreciated."
Leash On Faith,"Julie knew what she wanted to do; she just did not know where to begin. Her heart was in the right place because animals and helping them was a passion for her. It all began when she came across a Jack Russell puppy on the side of the road. It was good that she was on the side of the road and not attempting to cross the four lanes of traffic. She would have been hit without a doubt. She spotted her as she was approaching the light at the corner of Pine and Cone Avenues. She knew she needed to turn around and go back and get her. Julie drove down a block and made a U-turn and headed back and the dog was still there. She got out of her car and slowly approached her. She put up no resistant, wagging her tail, she all but leaped into her arms. Julie found herself almost in tears. She was so cute, mostly white with two black ears. She just knew she had to belong to a family who had to be looking for her. She did not have on a collar that might have identified her. She was able to place one of her dogs leashes around her neck. She scooped her up and placed her in the passenger seat of her car. She sat quietly as if this was not her first car ride. She took her home and preceded to feed her and give her water. She gave her a bowl of cool water and just watched her. The introduction to Hope went well also. Hope was a Poodle. Julie had rescued her about a year earlier. Hope looked Faith over and did the usual sniffing that dogs do. She thought with no name tag or anything she needed to come up with some type of name. Faith, Julie thought would fit her well. It was going to take a little faith to find out who she belonged to. As the two dogs shared water and food together Julie thought where she needed to start. She knew she had to do what she could to reunite Faith with her family. She imagined they must be frantic. She decided to make some calls to see if her family had contacted the local dog pounds. As of the time of her call no one had reported her missing. It was already close to six. Julie was surprised by that. She wondered how long had Faith been missing, a day, maybe two, maybe more? She decided to get started first thing in the morning, putting Faith picture out so if the owner saw it, they could contact her. She would also drive around the neighborhood in which she found her. Surely, someone would recognize Faith maybe even her owners. She fixed Faith a pallet, made up of two blankets that use to be Hopes. Hopes bed laid on the floor at the foot Julie's bed. Hope made her regular two turns before she laid down in her bed. Faith laid on the blankets next to Hope. It was surprising, the two dogs were fast asleep within an hour. The next day Julie rose to eight legs running through her small apartment, Hope & Faith were still getting alone pretty good. She got up and put the coffee pot on before letting them out in the backyard to do their business. Hope was house broken, and it looked as if Faith was too. The two tussled with each other but never fought. Hope was an only dog, but many trips to the dog park helped her to learned to be sociable with other dogs. Julie did not think that would be a problem, but she had noticed that Hope could be a little jealous if she paid too much attention to other dogs at the park or anywhere else for that matter. They ran back and forth from one end of the yard to the other. Hope finally came to the back door, her Mommas cue she wanted in. She rushed in with Faith not far behind. Both dogs headed to the kitchen where the dogs dishes were kept by the pantry door. Hope had her usual food and water dishes combo set, but Julie had to make Faith one of her own. She got two medium size stir bowls that worked out great. After taking her shower and getting dressed, Julie took a picture of Faith with her phone. She uploaded the picture on her Facebook timeline with Faiths description and where she had found her and how to reach out if anyone recognized her. She was certain someone would recognize Faith and give her a call and the dog would be on her way back to her family. She also went and had flyers made with Faiths picture. She thought about 15 should do. She was only putting them up in the vicinity in which she found Faith. Lucas Shopping Complex was small, with not very many businesses. It is located at the corner of Pine and Cone Avenues. It had about seven small businesses there. She would see if the owners would allow her to put a flyer up in the window. She then would go a block over to Jefferson Street and thumb tax a flyer to the big oak trees that lined the sidewalk. One more place she had to go before going home and that was the local newspaper. She took the same flyer and put it in the papers lost and found section. Julie thought with such assurance, this should do it. One week, no calls, two weeks, no calls, three and then four. Julie found herself a little put a back. There is no way she would let her Hope be away from her for that long. She would have called the police and filed a missing person report, she thought as she laughed at herself. She could hardly believe it. She had to consider, though her apartment had a nice backyard where the two dogs could play, the apartment itself was small. It had only one bedroom. The backyard was the only reason she got it in the first place. Hope would have some place to play, and it was only them. She was hoping to find Faiths family soon because she did not want her to go to the pound. She also had to consider that dogs can be expensive no matter how big or little they are. Hope had showed her that. The first eights months she had Hope she got sick, and the vet bills piled up. The vet was never able to say exactly what was wrong, but she eventually got better. Julie shook her head just thinking about having to deal with that with one dog let alone two dogs. Julie wondered could she afford another dog, to her it did not look like anyone was going to come forward to get Faith back. Time went by, she did not know what else to do. She did all she could. Julie decided to keep Faith, there was nothing left for her to do. She was just a test or two from being done with veterinarian school when she found Julie. It had been a long road, and she was determined to make it through. She had to admit that Faith and Hope though at times were a bit to manage, but they were her strength to a degree. She knew however that getting out of school was one thing paying back student loans was another. Julie knew she did not have time to worry about that she had to get a job and get one fast, first thing first. She started looking, putting in applications in the surrounding cities, counties, and states. She finished second in her class when she graduated, so that should help her stand out she thought. After about six months, she got a call. The good thing that it was a vet office just three counties over. She called and set up an interview with Dogs and Paws. Dr. Larry Mason was the head vet. She had two weeks to prepare. The day finally came. She was 30 minutes early. She met with the receptionist briefly, who let Dr. Mason know his 11 oclock appointment was there. Julie took a seat in the reception area and was soon called back. She stepped into Dr. Masons office. He was standing looking out of his office window. Julie cleared her throat to get his attention of which it did. He turned and looked at her and asked her to have a seat. He begins, I looked over your application and resume, you did very well in school, I am impressed. I cant say I did that well. Julie replied, Thank You Sir. She begins to relay to him how she had come across his advertisement in the first place by simply putting an ad in her local paper about a lost dog she had found. He suddenly leaned forward looking confused Julie thought. He picked up her application and noted, you live three counties over from here. She nodded. What type of dog is it? he asked. A black and white Jack Russell she said hesitantly. He, without hesitation begin to tear up. Julie did not know what to do. She did not know if she should leave or stay or what. Sir, Mr. Mason I am sorry. He replied, no, you did nothing wrong. Julie, do you still have the dog? he asked. Yes Sir, she replied. It is my dog Ive been looking and waiting. I never would have thought she would have gotten that far. Her name is Faith. Julie let out a scream. Now, he did not know what to do or say. Why did you scream? he asked.When I found her Dr. Mason, she did not have on a collar, so I had no way of knowing her name, so I named her Faith until I found her owner, Julie replied. Julie at that moment realized why Faith took to the name so easily. Dr. Mason, I will bring her back as soon as you want me to., He took his handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wiped the tears from his eyes. He begins to apologize for his reaction. He shared with Julie that Faith had been a special part of his family and how she had brought him so much joy. He never thought he would ever see her again. He told Julie of course you know you have the job as he shook her hand. They sat and talked for hours, first about Faith and Hope and then about the job. They agreed upon her salary, insurance and benefits like a 401k, something Julie never had. The best thing Julie liked was upon employment the company pays off half of your student debt. She almost screamed again when she heard that. He wanted to know when she could start and and when and if she needed to move closer to the hospital, the company would pay for it and help her find a place. She could use a company car until then to commute. It turned out Dr. Mason had a total of ten Dogs & Paws in five different states. He was spending a lot of his time at the Dogs & Paws just three counties away and was looking for someone to be the vet at this one. His other vet had to move back home to take care of her mother which explained why he was there. He shared with Julie, that one night he let Faith out and when he went to let her back in, she did not come. He felt almost certain she was stolen out of his backyard. On the way home Julie could hardly breathe, it was a lot to take in. She never would have thought that a her day would end so poetically wonderful. And all it took was a U-turn and a leash on Faith."
Have to say 'good bye',"""You have to come back Rain, you've done enough to protect earth from extraterrestrial destruction.""What does Rudra saviour want from me?

(Rain and Lana were dancing as a couple with others but there were unsaid words hanging between them.) ""Listen up everyone. Can I have your attention here for a minute, won't be long. Thank you all. I just want to say a grateful thanks for giving me space among you all. I remember how weird I behaved when I came to live here. It just makes me laugh now. Brushing in the balcony instead of bathroom, sleeping on the sofa, dancing like a monkey but you taught me everything and that too without getting annoyed or irritated. Thank you for everything.Thank you Lana for teaching me to cook a bit for myself when you are not around which hasn't happened till now. Thank you Pooh for sharing your pies with me, I can't thank each and everyone of you enough for being my best friends and my family."" ""I had a great time here but now l must,""(Suddenly a high pitched ringing startled them.) ""What was that sound?""""Where did it come from?""""That was so loud."" (Rain knew the sound, he sneaked away from the back while everyone was distracted and went home to check the source.) ""Saviour command you are here?""Did he come here to take me home himself. He know I never disobeyed him. ""I'm here. Don't be surprised I'm not here to steal you time infact I'm here to give you more. You know I don't make the final decision, we all work in solidarity to protect this universe. It was the decision of all the units to pull you from the earth."" ""I understand Saviour command and I was going to comply first thing in the morning."" ""You don't have to."" ""What?"" ""You sounded so desperate to stay here earlier today and I made a combined work of all your achievements and send it to different units. Just a few seconds ago I got all the answers and everyone have agreed to let you stay here. Work here."" ""But someday you are going to call me with the same news you call me today for."" ""Maybe maybe not but for now you are here to stay."" ""I think I should thank you."" ""You don't have to since I did what was good for you and everyone else."" ""I'm grateful Saviour command."" ""You should visit home more often, it doesn't take that long."" (With these final words Rudra Saviour left in the the bubble shaped spaceship which expanded as he entered.) This is the best moment of my life but how am I going to deal with the my friends now? They must have understood I was gonna say good bye. How will I deal with Lana?Can I just say I was drunk?There has to be some way. (Rain goes out and into the hall where celebration is taking place. People are still talking about that weird sound.) ""Rain where did you go?"" ""I was feeling drunk so I walked in open air to calm myself a bit."" ""You were saying some real serious stuff and you just disappeared after that sound started ringing."" ""Yes I apologise to all of you for that and Lana don't freak out please. That was my gaming device I bought online. I can't seem to get it's system right. I left it on and it just started ringing then I felt I should take a little walk outside so now here I'm."" ""And what was that speech about?"" ""Nothing Oma that was my gratification towards all of you that's it."" ""That's it?"" ""Yes Lana that's it. I honestly don't remember exactly what I said I was pretty drunk then."" ""You were saying something about our relationship, the end to it."" ""I was? I don't. Yes yes I was. And I'd like to say in front of everyone that mine and Lana's just friends relationship has come to an end and we officially announce that. Lana?"" ""They know about us Rain."" ""Maybe I'm still drunk. Still Lana and I are romantically connected and friendship will always remain the base to our relationship."" (Everyone cheered happily.) That was a good save Rain.Can I be more grateful for this day? No I can't be. This is the best day of my life."
DUAKI,"When you are different from others you always try to get the approval of society to fit yourself in. Nothing is more painful than get the denial of your acquaintance- when you are trying to fit among the people you know.This is thestoryof a unicorn named, Duaki who was born differentfrom others, he has two horns. He lived in the kingdom of Cornida, with his mother and father.For his parents he was the most beautiful.Like every parents they loved him, adored him, they didn't considered him different. How they could, he is the part of the love they shared. But Duaki never get contended by his parents love when he was growing up, he always soughtfor happiness and love in the outside world. He always desired for a bunch of friends like his other mates. His parents knew about his feelings of inferiority, his father told him , "" Duaki you have to accept yourself the way you are, you have to love yourself the way youare, then only you can live in the world the way you are."" Duaki understood hisfeelings.He said,"" but daddy how can I love myself when no one loves me or even like me, I might be lacking something"". These words of Duaki created a thump in the hearts of his parents, they didn't know what to say anymore. Duaki continued without looking in the eyes of his parents, ""Iam trying to fit in their standards, Iam trying to change myself and Iknow one day they will take me as their friends. Ican also have hangouts with my friends"" they can feel the pain in his words. Before they could have said anything, Duaki ran away. The sun was about to disappear, Duaki was facing his reflection in the flowing river which seems to be still for him. He might wanted distraction from his thought, from the thought of what his parents thinking of him right now. They have tried everything to assure him,he was loved enough,but it might be him who was focusedat the different side of the coin. It was about to dark, Duaki stood up to return home, on his way he saw his mates were playing, he hesitated but approached them, he asked, "" Hey! can I join you?"", his voice contained the fear of rejection. The other unicorns started shouting, ""How dare you to approach us?"", "" Go away from here""' "" You have ahorn of evil"", "" You will bring badluck to our kingdom"". After hearing those things Duaki was broken completely, he ran and ran to get as far away from there where he couldn't even hear the echo of those words. His foot started slowing down, he was breathing heavily, after few seconds he realized that he has come far from thatplace, it was dark all around, he couldn't see anything, the place was filledwith the cryingof crickets. Hewas so tired to move forward so hedecided to restthere.  Next morning he opened his eyes and freaked, "" Who are you? Where am I? "" He was again breathing heavily. While he was shrunken, a Pegasus approached him closely, both were unknown to each other. Duaki was still astonished,whileeveryone surrounded and carried him to their council board. Duaki was shivering, he was only remembering his parents.He was asking them to put him down but they seemed to ignore his words. His mind was flashing back the memories of his parents."" I should have listened to them"", he murmured.He was put down. He recognized the room as it was similar to his kingdom's council board. He startled at the voice came from front, "" Who are you? Where have you come from?"" The room was filled with the murmuring of citizens of the kingdom. Duaki was surprised to see a phoenix talking to him, now he believed the story told by his mother of phoenix. He answered in a low voice, ""I amDuaki and Iran away from mykingdom"", the murmuring sound got louder. He himself continued the reason, "" Iamdifferent from others, Idon't qualify how a unicorn should be"". Everybody gotsilent at his words. The phoenix came down of his stage and warmly welcomed him, ""you don't need to run away because of your appearance, you might be different but there must be a reason why you are different"". Duaki was overwhelmed by his words, he never thought someone other than his parents would tell him those words. The phoenix announced, ""We have got a new member, in our kingdomof Lilypodand I believe you all will love him as your friend."" The word friend had touched Duaki, he wasagainoverwhelmed,for a moment he has forgotten where he belonged to, or how will he live here alone, he was enjoying that moment. The day passed by him trying to talk with others but nobody showed interest in him. Everyday he went to the playground, watching others enjoying, hoping someone would call him to join. But it was weird to him, he was not having that fear of denial, maybe he was relieved that everyone in this new kingdom is different like him, he has this hope that there will be one day when he will be together with them, without changing himself. Just the thought of this was keeping him alive.  It was a bright sunny day, when Duaki as always got ready to go to the playground, he was looking happy. With his cheerful steps he reached the ground, but he didn't saw anybody. Surprisingly, he asked to himself, "" where did everyone go?, ""Duaki"", someone called his name, he got startled and looked behind, it was the same pegasus who was examining Duaki at his first day in kingdom. Duaki asked with an enthusiasm "" yes! do you have something to say to me"". Pegasus said, "" do you know how to play hide and seek"", Duaki felt the awkwardness in his voice and laughed, he said,"" yes, i know"", he was smiling ear to ear. He knew he liked the pegasus. Everybody enjoyed the game including Duaki. On the way to home, Duaki thanked the pegasus, "" What is your name"", Duaki asked with his grateful voice. ""Fleek"", he replied. Duaki was very happy to have a friend which he had always longed to. They became best friends. Fleek always encouraged Duaki to stand for himself. Duaki was feeling that he was reborn, now he knew who he is. It was a bright sunny day, when drumrolls in the market can be heard, where Duaki and Fleek were buying souvenirs to dedicate their friendship. Duakis attentionwas caught by the sound of drumrolls which became louder as it got closer to him, and gradually the sound vanished. He immediately asked Fleek,who seemed to be unbothered, what those drumrolls mean.Fleek laughed at the blank face of Duaki and said, "" every year there is a festival of kingdoms where every kingdom come together to show their strengths and the best of them wins"". When not getting any response from Duaki, Fleek turned and saw a worried face. He asked, "" What happened, if you don't want you can participate as an audience, it is not necessary to participant as a contestant"". Fleek tried to looked in his friend's eyes and softly asked ""are you afraid to meet them"", Duaki raised his head and said, "" I don't know.......what will they say.....my parents.....what will i say to them"", Fleek got worried after seeing tears in his eyes. "" I am with you"", he said. Duaki knew none of his friend's word will lower his anxiety. He smiled for his friends sake.  After someday the day came, everyone was excited, happy and cheerful except Duaki. He couldn't pretend to smile even if he wanted to. The thought of his parents was making him more anxious. He was there but he wasn't, he was only focused in his thinking in spite of chaos. The announcement of matches was done but Duaki was lost in his thoughts, Fleek shouted, ""Duaki...... Duaki.....Duaki"", suddenly Duaki realised the sound and responded with a weak sound, "" yes"", Fleek signaled him that match has started. Duaki joined everyone, the sound of cheering got louder with every steps, so his heartbeats. They also entered the crowd who was shouting and enjoying. ""The kingdom of Cornida is leading and the final match between kingdom of Cornida and kingdom of Lilypod is to begin, whoever wants to represent their kingdom can come in the arena"", a long announcement was made, but Duaki was focused on the size of crowd. He was relieved that his parents will not be able to find him. The match begun and the unicorns of kingdom of Cornida was in upper hand in the match. The cheering was loud in one side while getting slower on the other. Fleek looked at Duaki who looked much better than before, he whispered in his ear, "" Why don't you join from our side"", Fleek got the expected reaction from Duaki. Duaki rolled his eyes and again focused on the match. Fleek once more tried to pursuade, Duaki shouted, "" I can't do it, do you want to expose me so badly"", he was frustrated. Fleek was startled at his response, he tried to calm down himself and tried to make Duaki understand. He said, "" without even trying how can you say you are bad"", Duaki tried to ignore his words. The thing he was running from was not his possibility of failure but his parents. He was determined to not face them. He softly requested his friend, to not ask for such favours which he can't do. Fleek got silent. After a moment the situation got tensed in the arena as the kingdom of Lilypod were loosing their points. Duaki was certainly getting irritated and finally decided to join the match. Fleek has given him a wide smile of support. He entered the arena with a loud cheer. He was trying to look at the crowd to get away of the thoughts of his parents.He was happy to see the enthusiasm of people for him, loudest of them is Fleek. He moved to the arena to have a face to face with other unicorn named, Swaam. Both recognised each other, Swaam with a smirk said,  You are alivebut maybe no more,  I will kill you, Swaam aggressively shouted and threw himself on Duaki. Duaki was perplexed by the sudden attack and fell hardly on the ground. Again the sound got louder on one side and got weaker on the other. Duaki managed to stand up again with the cheer of his friends. He can clearly hear his name in the crowd. This time Duaki made an fierce attack on Swaam but Swaam was much more stronger than he thought. Duaki again fell down on the ground. He was injured. He was tired but he didnt seem to be giving up. Its maybe the anger that he was holding since past. He wanted to prove them and more than them to him that he is a qualified unicorn. He also possess those purity, greatness, grace and love that a unicorn always have. Fleek rushed from his place to Duaki,  Are you alright, he asked in a worried voice. Duaki was trying to stand. Fleek continued in a gentle voice,  You can give up, no need to injure yourself. Duaki can understand his friend, he was happy to have someone like him by his side.  I will end this, trust me, Duaki said in a assured voice. Fleek smiled and back his steps to his place.  The match was going tensed. Duaki was much more injured but he was nowhere to give up. When suddenly Swaam shouted and aggressively kicked Duaki,  This is the end of you evil unicorn. Duaki fell with a thud. Fleek ran toward Duaki. He was moaning in pain. Duaki said with tears in his eyes,  I cant defeat him. You can, Fleek consoled his friend.  Actually you have, Duaki was confused at his words. Fleek continued,  They never thought you will made up to here, he is full of anger now, Duaki was listening to Fleeks words. Maybe its the thing that he needed the most at the moment. Those comforting words.Fleek praised Duaki,  I have never thought untill I met you that a unicorn can be so strong, away from his parents he raised himself so well.if your parents will see you they will be very proud, Duaki hugged Fleek. Fleek looked in his eyes and said with a determined voice,  You are stronger than you think, they have got one horn and you have two horns, you are more powerful than you think and thats what they are afraid of.  Thats what my parents always wanted to make me understand, Duaki said. Duaki was filled with an inner energy of love of his dear ones. He knew, no matter he would win or lose, he knew himself and he is proud of it. Duaki stood again, this time his eyes were shining bright. The arenafilled with the cheering voices. Swaam seemed to be trembled. He aggressively made attacks on Duaki but Duaki defensed himself. When Swaam got tired with continuous strikes, Duaki ran toward him and threw him away with his horns. He then grabbed his leg and threw him. Swaam fell with a loud thud. The cheering got louder for Duaki. He ran toward him to attack,  I give up, Swaam begged. Duaki stopped and said,  I am not you, I will let you live. Duaki told him confidently, I am proud ofmyself and not ashamed of my horns.  I hope you will be good to others in spite of their appearances, Duaki said. Everyone were cheering Duaki. His friends hugged him, praised him and danced all around him. Duaki, a feeble voice came from behind. Duaki knew whose voice is this. He turned back with a fear in his eyes. He can see the tears rolling down their cheeks. It was his parents. There was no anger in their eyes but only love which they have have saved for him for years. They hugged him and cried. Everyone were crying and happy by this view.Duaki said,  I am sorry, I disappointed both of you. His mother adored him and said,  You have made us proud and we are lucky to have you as our son.  We missed you, his father said. Duaki looked at his father and hugged him. I will not run away anymore, Duaki assured his parents. Fleek joined and greeted them. He welcomed them in the kingdom of Lilypod. Duakis parents decided to settled down with himin theLilypod."
Saying Goodbye to Her,"Jackson sat at the small table outside of Starbucks, while New York City zoomed by, the usual busy city feel on a Spring afternoon. He lifted the lid of his decaf latte, oh the smell of coffee! He sipped and breathed in the aroma of life around him, watching the two little shitzu's sniffing for tidbits of sweets. He checked his Smartwatch for the time, Lilliane would be here soon, he thought glumily, his mood changing now from blissful to gloom. He had been dating her for awhile now, almost six months and he really liked her exuberant personality and beauty - she was fun, but now he had to break the news to her. Jackson got a promotion and would be moving to L.A. now, his job as a top executive was taking him to a new level.""Are you kidding me? Yes - of course I will take the position, it would be an honor"", he replied at the meeting of CEO's last week. And he signed the contract, he would be leaving at the end of the month, Lilliane would be pissed to the core and back. Lillianne, well what could he say about her that could describe a beautiful free sprit beauty, her long legs, her laughter that shook a room around. She was the kind of woman who made heads turn walking into a room, lighting it up like the fourth of July, even on a rainy day, in jeans and a t-shirt she was stunning, bigger than life.""Darling sorry I am late, traffic, you know how Manhattan is on a Friday afternoon, oh what a gorgeous day, let's take a walk in Central Park?"" She pleaded happily. She had been to her mother's, and just found out a wedding was in store for her brother Rob, a construction company owner with a child bride, a woman ten years younger, ok good luck with that, Jackson shook his head. He personally would not have done something like that, he was a more no-nonsense kind of a guy.""Lil, I have to tell you something......"", He began to speak, lowering his voice even though the traffic beside them grew louder suddenly, more intense as the seconds passed.""Oh, I have an appt to get my maid of honor's dress at Saks, they just got in a new shipment of the Spring lines. I cant wait, won't that be fun, you do have a tux don't you?"", She began to check her cell phone then which was buzzing off the small table, to Jackson it sounded like a freight train rumble.""Yes I have a tuxedo, remember we went to the opera last month?"" He answered defiantly, oh she could act so precarious at times, she knew he had one.""Mom, I know, don't worry, the florist will have all the patterns to choose from, and yes, a vegan cake, I know Catherine is a vegan."" Lilliane was looking at her nails, bored, listening to her mom rattling on and on about the wedding plans.""Lil, there has been a ......"", Jackson was ready to scream now.""Oh yes, thank you, and could I have a carrot muffin? And a bottle of water?"", Lil told the waitress who came to their table wearing the green and white uniform in his face, like, hello, I am trying to break up with my woman here, thanks. The feeling of defeat was endless, tiring, Jackson checked his watch again for the afternoon appointments, briefings on his new position. The two little dogs had long gone now, traffic was still rolling by, New York was still breathing life in the sidewalks, bustling with people and noise.""Lilianne, I got a new job."" He came right out and said it, but, once again she was on her phone, not having touched her muffin, she was texting now, with fervor and her long well manicured nails flashing in red shine in front of him, he felt like a dot. Those little dots you saw at the end of those old movies when it finished, fading to the demase. He stood up, waved her off, and decided he would have to send her an email, this conversation was going nowhere fast, he grabbed a taxi, and as he tried to wave goodbye, she was still texting on her phone, oblivious to anything else.	Jackson got back to his office and opened his laptop to begin the email, this would be the only way now to communicate with her now. Darn, his red button was flashing on his personal phone line. ""I have Mr. Thornton here to see you, should I send him in?""  Blair asked him, the receptionist temp who had been there a week.  ""Oh right, I forgot about him, yes send him in. "" Jackson forgot to put this meeting on his watch calendar.  So much for Smartwatches, they are only smart if you make them smart.  	The meeting lasted the rest of the afternoon, and he was ready for dinner and a run.  Liliane hadn't even texted or tried to call him since lunch, he would finish the email later at home.  Jackson stopped and had a quick bite at the taco place, then the subway home to Brooklyn.  He was tired, a run would rejuvenate him, after a shower he would lay in his bed and send the email then.  	But he fell asleep, he was so exhausted, his legs felt like rubbered weight - he barely noticed any feeling from his usual workout high, sleep was inevitably comforting."
All Frogs Need Friends,"Once upon a time, there was a tadpole named Timmy. Timmy lived in a pond full of all sorts of fishes, like basses and trouts. They swam around the pond with their fins and tails. Timmy didn't have any fins, but he did have a tail that helped him swim around just like the other fishes.	Timmy wanted to make some friends, so Timmy swam toward a school of fish. 	""Hello, my name is Timmy, Timmy the Tadpole,"" said Timmy to a smaller fish. ""What is your name?""	""My name is Susan, Susan the Small-mouthed Bass,"" said the fish. ""Are you new around here?""	""Yeah,"" answered Timmy. ""I don't have any friends here. I hoped you could be my friend.""	""Not a problem,"" said Susan with delight. ""You look nothing like any other fish I have ever met. Let me show you to all of my friends.""	Susan introduced Timmy to her other fish friends. Susan's friends were amazed by Timmy's lack of fins. They began to play and swim with Timmy, as though he was a fish just like them.	Every day, Timmy would play with Susan and her friends. Soon, Timmy and Susan became best friends. Timmy was good friends with everyone in the school of fish.	One day, Timmy felt strange. He didn't know, but he felt like he changed. Not only that, but every other fish was looking at him strangely.	Timmy came to Susan and the school of fish. ""What happened to you?"" asked Susan shockingly. 	Timmy was confused. ""What wrongs?"" he asked.	""You grew legs,"" Susan said.	Timmy turned his head and saw two little legs sticking out of his back. He didn't have those before. Timmy realized why all of the other fish looked at him differently. It was because he was different.	""Oh! You are one of those frogs!"" shouted Ben the Big-mouthed Bass, one of Susan's friends. ""You are not even a fish! Why are you hanging out with us? This is a school of ""	""Hey!"" Susan said to Ben. ""That's not very nice. Timmy is still our friend, even if he is not a fish. We can still play together.""	""No way!"" exclaimed Ben. ""He is a frog, not a fish, and frogs can't be friends with fish. Soon, Timmy is going to grow all o his legs. He will be able to go above the water and leave us here alone.""	Ben and other fish in the school began to swim away from Timmy. Susan still stayed with Timmy.	Timmy frowned and asked, ""Hey Susan, what is a frog?""	""Frogs are amphibians that lived on the other side of the pond,"" answered Susan. ""Unlike fish, they can live on the land.""	Timmy looked down and held himself back from crying. Susan noticed how sad Timmy was, now that all of the school left him. 	""It's okay, Timmy,"" said Susan. ""Even though you are a frog, I will still play with. I promise I will always be your best friend.""	Timmy swan with tiny legs to where the school of fish always was, but all the fish would swim away from him whenever he went there. Susan didn't leave Timmy, though. Just as she promised, Susan played with Timmy. 	Even though many of the fish didn't play or talk to him anymore, Timmy remained happy. He was now excited to grow his legs out and go on the land. He hoped that maybe he would make some new friends. Susan still would be his best friend, but the idea of more new friends excited Timmy.	After some time, Timmy finally became a full-grown frog. He was now ready to go above the water.	""Goodbye, Timmy!"" said Susan joyously. ""Have fun!""	Timmy waved goodbye to Susan and head to the land.	Timmy couldn't believe what he saw when he came above the water. The ground was covered with green hair. Coming out of the ground were long brown pillars with the same green hair. Above those pillars was a gigantic blue blanket.	Timmy hopped around met a brown furry thing about his size. ""Hello,"" Timmy said. ""I am new around here. What's your name?""	""I am Sid the Squirrel,"" said the furry thing. ""Where are you from?""	""I am from the pond,"" said Timmy. ""My name is Timmy the Frog. By the way, I have a couple of questions I want to ask.""	""Go ahead,"" said Sid the Squirrel.	""What is this green hair on the ground?"" asked Timmy.	""That isn't green hair,"" said Sid. ""That is grass.""	""Okay. What are those brown pillars?"" asked Timmy.	""They aren't brown pillars,"" said Sid. ""They are trees.""	""Uh-huh. What is that blue blanket?"" asked Timmy.	""That isn't a blue blanket,"" said Sid. ""That is the sky.""	""Wow,"" said Timmy. ""There is so little I know about this place. Can you be my friend and maybe show me around?""	Sid laughed at Timmy. ""Your friend?"" Sid said. ""Why would I be your friend? You are nothing like me. You have a big mouth with no teeth, while I have a small mouth with big teeth. You are slimy and gooey, while I am soft and furry. You are green, while I am brown. You are too weird and ugly to be my friend."" Sid ran off, still laughing at Timmy.	The sun was setting and night took over the sky. Timmy stood alone on the land, feeling sadder than he ever felt before in his life. Fish in the pond thought he was strange and Animals on the land thought he was strange. No one wanted to be his friend anywhere he went. He was all alone.	The worse part, Timmy thought, was that Sid was right. Timmy looked at his reflection on the pond and thought that he was weird and ugly. He had beady eyes and an oversize mouth. He was slimy and gooey. He was green. Timmy began to cry as he realized that he was too weird and too ugly to be anyone's friend.	All of the sudden, two green things hopped out of the water and onto the land. Timmy was frightened and hopped back, but he couldn't believe what he saw. It was two other frogs!	""Hello there,"" said one of the frogs. ""My name is Fiona, Fiona the Frog, and this my friend Fred.""	""Hello,"" said Fred, waving his hand.	""You look sad,"" said Fiona. ""Are you okay? What is your name?""	Timmy was still filled with shock and excitement. ""My name is Timmy,"" he answered excitedly. ""Timmy the Frog. I am new around here and I don't really have any friends.""	""Well,"" said Fred. ""All the frogs are on the side of the pond. I am sure you will find some friends.""	They hopped together to the other side of the pond. When they got there, Timmy saw hundreds of frogs hopping everywhere. He began to smile and cry at the same time.	Just a moment, Timmy was the saddest he ever felt. Now, he was the happiest he has ever been. For a second, he thought he was too ugly for anyone, but now he feels accepted. 	Timmy wasn't alone, as long as he was other frogs. The truth is all frogs need friends because no one else can be their friend."
A Fountain of Falling Stars,"There was once a poor girl called Haneefa who lived in a barn together with her mother. Every night the girl would sneak out and sit at their front porch to gaze at the falling stars. One day, her mother saw her sitting at their front steps, she sits beside her daughter and ask ""What are you doing here at night Haneefa?"" she asked while gazing at her daughter who's eyes are looking upward. ""I am looking at the falling stars,"" said the daughter. ""Yes they are beautiful to look at, but you still need to rest,"" said her mother. ""Mother, I want to find the fountain where falling stars came from and make a wish that our lives will become better and we will become rich,"" Haneefa suddenly said, which caught her mother by surprise. ""No one will ever find it because it is not real,"" said the mother. ""But I can find it mother if I just believe in myself, I know I can!"" she tried to convince her. Her mother was still unconvinced and dismissed her daughter's every attempt to persuade her. Haneefa continues to wake up every night and gazed at the falling stars. It made her woke up late every morning and unable to help her mother with the house chores or in taking care of the barn animals. Her mother had enough and locked her up in her room. ""From now on, I will lock you up in your room until you realize that your dreams are impossible!"" her mother scolded her. She felt sad, angry, and betrayed that her mother didn't even believe her, so she wears her yellow boots and waited until her mother had fallen asleep. Later that night, she opened her window and reach a tree near their house, which she used to climb her way down. ""I will prove to my mother that the fountain is real."" the girl said to herself as she went into the dark forest to search for the hidden fountain. The next day, her mother felt guilty, so she cooked her daughter's favorite food and went to her room to apologize to her. As she opened the door the room was empty and she could not find her daughter. ""Where's my daughter!"" cried the mother. She noticed a piece of paper lying at the bedside table and went near it. It said ""Dear Mother, don't worry, I will come back and prove to you that the fountain is real"" read the mother, as she sits down on the bed. She wished that she had never scolded her daughter and doubted her dream, that way she might not have left home.The mother could not do anything except only to cry for her lost daughter. Meanwhile, the girl was still searching and was starting to feel hungry. She had been walking for hours, yet there are no signs of the fountain. Haneefa begins to lose hope when suddenly she heard a tiny squeak. She looked down and saw a little white mouse with its tail trapped on Haneefa's boots. ""Watch where you're going!"" squeaked the mouse, while it tried to pull his tail off the boots. Haneefa hurriedly raises her boots to set the mouse's tail free. ""I am sorry, I wasn't paying attention to where I am going,"" apologized Haneefa ""I am Haneefa by the way, what's your name little mouse?"" she asked as she bends down to talk to the mouse. ""My name is Angelo, I was looking for food when you suddenly appear and step on my tiny tail,"" said Angelo as he rubs his swollen tail. ""How about you? What are you doing in the forest?"" he asked Haneefa as he crawled towards her. ""I am searching for the fountain of falling stars, then I started feeling hungry, maybe that's the reason why I didn't notice you,"" she said to the mouse. ""I know someone who can help you find the fountain! But first, you need to help me find something to eat"" said the mouse while trying to climb up Haneefa's skirt. Haneefa picked up his new friend and put him on her shoulder. ""I would gladly help you!"" said Haneefa cheerfully as she continues to walk eagerly searching for something they can eat. Luckily, Angelo knew a lot about edible foods in the forest. They were able to collect a hand full of berries and nuts which they place on Haneefa's long skirt.""This would be enough for a three-person meal,"" said Angelo while looking at the skirt full of food. ""Three? Who is the third person?"" asked Haneefa, she didn't think Angelo would be living with someone. ""I am living with my grandfather, he is the one you are looking for. The one and only mouse that knows the location of the fountain that you're referring to,"" Without hesitation, Haneefa followed the direction where Angelo pointed at. They arrived in front of a large weathered tree with a big hole at the center. The hole was big enough for her to enter. Angelo got down from her shoulders and went inside the hole. When she followed him and went inside, she fell and hit her face on the ground. Ow! she cried out in pain as she slowly lifted her head. Haneefa saw a miniature living room filled with small tables and chairs. She looked to her right and there was a small double-decker bed enough for two mice to sleep on. And to her left is a kitchen with a complete set of utensils. She was so amazed at what she saw, that she failed to notice a startled mouse in front of her. ""Grandpa I am back!"" yelled Angelo as he picked up the berries and nuts scattered all around the floor. ""Angelo! Who is she? Why did you bring a human in our tree!?"" asked the frightened old mouse to his cheerful grandson. Angelo explained everything to his grandfather while they were preparing for lunch, how he met Haneefa and why she followed Angelo to their tree. ""So you are looking for the fountain of falling stars?"" the old mouse asked Haneefa, who was sitting quietly at the corner. ""Yes, sir I do! If I wish on that fountain, I would surely give my mother a better life replied Haneefa. The old mouse just nods his head as the three of them eat their lunch and chat the whole afternoon. When it was getting late, the old mouse decided to go outside, since the evening is the perfect time to search for a bright fountain. Haneefa carried Angelo and his grandfather on her shoulders as she climbed up towards the big hole of the tree.She noticed that it was already dark and stars had already formed up the sky. ""If you really want to see the fountain then I will take you there, but once you find it, I will have to leave you and you must find your way back home on your own,"" said the old mouse as he looks intensely at Haneefa's eyes ""But why must you leave me? Can't you just guide me back home? What if I get lost? What if I never get to go back home?"" she asked, anxiously wondering why she needs to find her way home alone. ""It is a test given by the fountain to those who want their wishes to be granted,"" said the old mouse, ""If your wish is for good intention and if your heart's intentions would not change after getting your wish, then the fountain will turn you momentarily into a falling star that will lead you home, but if it's bad, then you will be turned into one of the stars that you adoringly stared at the sky, forever"" warned the old mouse. The old mouse asked Haneefa to put them down and started crawling forward to the deeper part of the forest. They've cross tall weathered trees that look like a bunch of claws, muddy grounds that dirtied her yellow boots, and foggy paths that made her almost tripped while walking. It was getting darker, and the deeper they go within the forest the narrower the path they take. The old mouse suddenly stops and ahead of them is a deserted moldy fountain. ""This is the fountain you have been looking for dear child,"" said the mouse ""But why does it look dirty? It doesn't even shoot falling stars in the sky?"" asked Haneefa, looking disappointed. All this time she taught that the fountain she believed in was true, but she was wrong. ""Child be patient, all you need to do is say the magic word,"" the old mouse said as he cleared his throat, ""Wish! Wish! Wish Upon me! Let your dreams be free!"" shout the mouse. Suddenly a burst of blinding lights soared up the sky making Haneefa cover her eyes with her hands. When she peeks behind her hands, the moldy fountain changed into a glittering gold color. Instead of water, bright lights filled the fountains basin. It was truly a sight to behold, ""Wow! I have never seen anything like this before."" exclaimed Haneefa, as she approaches the golden fountain. She looked back and saw the old mouse and Angelo crawling away ""Now that you are here, it's time for us to go, good luck Haneefa, may your wishes come true,"" said the old mouse as he and Angelo wave their tiny paws to say goodbye to Haneefa and shortly after they disappear behind the fog. She realized the sadness of not seeing each other again when the mice left as she continues to head back towards the fountain. When she came closer she heard a serene voice, ""Make a wish, I shall grant it for your bliss, but be warned, an intention full of malice, makes a soul lost forever in my forest"" said the serene voice, that is coming from the fountain. ""I don't mean any harm to anyone dear fountain,"" said Haneefa, ""I just wish for my mother to have a good life, a happy life full of treasures,"" she earnestly wished into the fountain, crossing her arms and closing her eyes, to prove her sincerity. For a few seconds, nothing happened, then the lights pulled Haneefa into the fountain's basin. Haneefa was too surprised that she was unable to move or do anything. Bright light surrounds her everywhere, yet she wasn't scared. In fact, she felt sleepy. Slowly she closes her eyes and gives in to sleep. Back at the barn, Haneefa's mother was still in mourning. She misses her little girl dearly. At night she waits on their front porch and gazes at the falling star just like Haneefa would normally do before. One night, when she went to their porch, She saw the brightest light she had ever seen, heading towards their house. As it draws nearer into the house, everything starts to change. Their house turned into a mansion, their old dusty furniture change into new and extravagant ones. There once muddy barn became a flowery garden and the animals turned into maids and butlers. Lastly, her clothes also change into a beautiful blue gown adorned with shimmering diamonds and pearls. Finally, the light descended gently into her arms, and behold her little girl was back. Haneefa gently opens her eyes and smile towards her mother, ""I told you the fountain is true,"" she said to her mother. ""Yes, I believe you! I will never doubt your dreams again my lovely Haneefa,"" her mother cried out, embracing her daughter tightly in her arms. And for the rest of their lives, Haneefa and her mother lived a happy and wonderful life, full of riches, love, and dreams that continues to come true. The End."
A ROAD TRIP,"Dana sat back in the oversized chair at the car dealer lot in the office, the car guy checking over the papers to finalize the sale of her truck and camper rig, a Ford and pop-up camper attached. She had decided on that after considerable research, and chose the latter, being the most efficient for off-road travels to places she wanted to see. Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, where ever her heart desired. She had been planning and waiting a long time now to follow her dreams. Open highways, new people, sights of nature and canyons. Not to mention warm weather - after enduring cold winters in Canada, she wanted to take the journey and follow her heart. ""Okey dokey, now all we need is your name here, here, and here, and this baby is all yours."" Ronnie said into the paperwork, as he then handed her with sweaty palms the package. He had his Subway off to the far side of his desk, which she could smell the onions and sweet sauce, his large diet coke beside that half slurped away. She happily signed her life away, literally, and he then gave her the keys to her new rig.""I cant' believe I own this, I can go wherever I want, nothing to hold me back now."" She said as he walked her across the lot, this baby was all hers. The car guy waddled to show her the final details, his forehead bearing droplets of sweat in the July heat, it was early still, the sun was beating down on the pavement underneath their feet. It took Dana two weeks to find this deal, she was proud as hell, grinning like the Chershire cat ear to ear. ...  ""  ""  "" Did saying goodbye and change have to be so friggin hard? She might have for a second or two been talked into staying, these people she worked with were so kind, such a wonderful little group, no one could ask for more than that in a job. ... Dana drove the truck out of the parking lot, deciding to drive down some local country road areas to get used to the vehicle and its power, the all terrain tires feeling levelled, as she fiddled with the stereo to find some music, settling on oldies that she loved. She turned the a/c on, as the day promised some hot sunny skies, then she would go back to her apartment to pack and get ready to leave behind the life she was comfortable with. 'How things changed, in less than a month' she breathed the idea, making it happen as a fly weaves a web to secure sustenance. First the decision, then the research, and now, here she was, in control of her own destiny, the cliche but a reality now too. Her cell phone was fully loaded, the GPS and the tracker so she could be found if need be were all up and running smoothly.In ten days she would be in Arizona, her first stop, and from there the sky was the limit.She had to make some stops, first to Walmart, stocked up on groceries, then she had to say a few more goodbyes along the way. Once the tiny fridge and cupboards were fully loaded, she was almost ready to leave. She texted her boss, letting John know that was almost done here in town, that she was so excited she could bust from happiness. She thought about the last 20 years, hell, she thought about the last 23 days, from ending her tenancy at the apartment she was renting to deciding on what rig to get herself set up with, she felt filled with satisfaction at the accomplishment she completed. Now, her new journey was about to be embraced, the highways were hers to own, she was here.""Ok, full tank of gas, check, grocery haul, check, papers, check, all I have to do is drive."" She told herself, and climbed up into the driver's seat, breathing in the smell of a new vehicle, leather and chrome beneath her bear legs.  She turned the ignition, listened to the purr of the new engine, and never looked back."
One percent of something !!,"Lights were blinking by splendour colours like a painter using his brush to paint a canvas, the cool breeze of wind touching my checks, tears were continusely rolling down from my eye to the chin , it was a pin drop silence around me I was just able to hear my heart beat.

""""Okay , just pass that feather "" I saw a feather lying near my feet I pick up and gave it to her "" Thanks , You continue.....! "" she said.Huh...? OK..... After saying that I started looking front. I tear the mark sheet which was in my hand and throw it away, it was like detaching a part from myself which kept hurting me.I gathered all my courage by convincing myself that this is the only last and the best option to do and without any further talk I step ahead my one leg in order to fell off from the terrace ..... she started singing - . , .,  . - I looked at her she was looking at the sky like she isfinding something ""what are you doing?

After that I learned that life is like a circle.A circle which carries happiness, triumphs,sadness, nostalgia..........In our whole life we countinusly cross this path,defeat the problems, overcome our fears and keep on repeating again and again like an unstoppable journey ."
A Widow's Coin,"A Widows Coin By Heather Ann Martinez  Deep in the shrouds of evergreens and endless butterflies lay the castle of the kingdom of Care-A-Soul. The king had recently passed away leaving his son Edward the throne. Edward was not like his father. The king, Liam, had been a very humble man. King Liam valued the contributions of everyone in his kingdom. He knew his people did not have a lot of money or great wealth to spare. They were always generous with their earnings as was the king. He tried to instill in Prince Edward the value of everyones contribution to the kingdom, but Prince Edward wasnt as humble or gentle as his father was. When Prince Edward was left the throne, a neighboring kingdom took over. King Josiah, King Liams older brother, decided he would be the better ruler of Care-A-Soul. Prince Edward liked his uncle and was the first to accept King Josiah as ruler of the land. Prince Edward didnt feel he was ready to rule the kingdom. What he did not realize was that King Josiah was not a fair, humble king like his father. In fact, King Josiah was the opposite. He was greedy and he wanted everything. Instead of allowing the people of Care-A-Soul to give a generous portion of their earning and their harvest to the king, King Josiah demanded more. He, in many ways, bled them dry. The people became oppressed by the new laws King Josiah set for them.Their crops began to wither and the people became hungry. King Josiah was not merciless if any one of his subjects was caught stealing grain or took an extra portion. The people that defied him disappeared in the night. No one ever heard from them again.Mothers feared for their children. Fathers guarded their families, but they were not strong enough to stand up to King Josiah. Prince Edward was aware that his people were suffering but felt helpless to do anything about it. His fathers former advisors would visit with him in secret and try to help him see reason. The prince was in denial that his uncle would demand so much of his people. He defended his uncle and reminded the former advisors that they were talking about the ruling king. As time went on, the fertile land became more like a desert. The river beds began to dry up. The earth that had fed them was turning into a dust bowl. King Josiahs soldiers had destroyed many of the homes and businesses of the people. The scent of ash and dust could be smelled for miles. Yet, King Josiah demanded more. He sent out his armies to conquer more kingdoms. As he absorbed more land, he took the majority of the wealth of that land for himself. One day, a woman went to see the prince. She told Prince Edward about her mother. My mother went to see your father, King Liam, many years ago. There was a shortage of food at that time. She told your father she wanted to help, but she had lost her husband and all of her world possessions with the exception of one small coin. She sacrificed what she had left. Your father, tears in his eyes, took the coin. He told my mother he would only use it in the event of an emergency. He told her that coin became more valuable to him than all of the jewels and gold he had. My mother said your father saved the coin in a box so that it might be offered to anyone who oppresses the kingdom. The prince was stunned. He never heard about this widow or her coin. He looked at this woman who was kneeling before him. Tears were streaming down her face. He had not realized what his uncle had done to the people. He personally was not affected by the kings laws. He did not believe the people when they told him what the king forced them to do. He didnt know that people were disappearing in the middle of the night. The prince listened to the woman. He asked her to tell him everything about her mother that she could remember. Her mother passed away shortly after giving the king her coin. Prince Edward was so humbled by the womans words. He never expected anyone to tell him about his fathers conversation with a woman who gave him what she valued to help save the kingdom.Prince Edward had the box the coin had been kept in. His father warned him to keep a watchful eye over it. His father told him it was worth more to him than any other gold or silver piece in the kingdom. Later that day, Prince Edward went to see King Josiah. King Josiah met him with open arms. The king was very happy to see the prince until the prince started talking about the problems the peasants were facing. The prince told him that it wasnt just the peasants that were being oppressed but all of the people were facing unnecessary hardships. Hardships his father never would have allowed to happen. The king became enraged. He told the prince that the people were telling him lies because they didnt like him. Prince Edward knew it was more than that. The prince stood up and went to the window. He told the king their kingdom was known for lush evergreens and butterflies. The evergreens were cut down to make more room for crops. The land was never allowed to settle and the next season the crops failed and more trees were removed and scarce crops were harvested and so on.The prince pointed to the barren land and said this was not what his father wanted for all of them. The prince asked the king where the missing people were. The king denied that anyone was missing. He told the prince that several people were relocated for their own protection. King Josiah smiled. He asked the prince what he intended to do. The prince asked the king what it was that he most wanted in the world. The king said that what he most wanted and couldnt find was what his brother King Liam had. King Liam told him there was a coin among his possessions that was more rare and valuable than any other coin he owned. The prince told the king he knew exactly what he was talking about, and he offered it to the king. If I give this coin to you Uncle, will you let my kingdom go. I will assume the throne and you and your armies can go home. This coin that your father owned. Do you believe that it can really turn fortunes around? Are you so willing to give it up? Like my father before me, I would do anything for my people. I would give up something so precious for them. The prince opened the box and gave the king the widows coin. The king marveled at it. He thought it was made out of a rare metal or mineral. He took the coin and left Prince Edward the kingdom. The prince grew in stature as a humble and wise king. He learned from the widows daughter that there are people willing to sacrifice of them selves for their neighbor. King Josiah never returned to Care-A-Soul. He feared his ignorance regarding the coin. He never found anyone in his kingdom who could tell him the coin was valuable. He never saw the beauty in what was in front of him."

The ghost warned the prince that he must give up something valuable if he wanted to escape his kingdom and go to the Ninth Realm, where he could have all the friends he wanted.If he took the treasure, he would become a frog.A frog?Yes, do you wanna become a frog?I shook my head.

He hopped back through the woods and returned the treasure.Im sorry I took your treasure, he croaked. The ghost turned him back into a prince.

Her cheeks turned red.That's a funny name! I giggled, then quickly cleared my throat.The prince appeared. Well, young lad, will you be my friend?Hes here!I dont see anyone.Oh, great!Well, Im waiting the prince said.Just to be clear. I am the only one who can see you.Thats correct, young lad.I thought so. Youre lonely, right?Thats correct. Im very lonely.Uh, dude. I cant tell if this is real, or youre trying to trick me, or what? Lora said.Why cant you find someone else? Why me? I asked the prince.Because you have the mind of a toddler.OKNo one else can hear my words because they shut their imagination off.But plenty of people use their imagination.Yes, but none are as pure as yours.This is crazy.What is? Lora asked.Since I have a good imagination, I am the only one who can communicate with him.Uh, OK.What willit be, young lad? asked the prince.K, fine, Ill be your friend.Excellent!

""Id like to go, but I have to study for my algebra test.Oh, yeah!Sorry, dude.Good luck! I called after her. I got a feeling she was too weirded out. I understand. I was too.Mommy, Im going out for a little bit. I'll be back before din-din.""OK, sweetheart. Do you have your phone?Yes.OK. Have fun!I will. Bye-bye. I opened the front door and walked out. I went to the end of the driveway. OK, Im out in the dark, wearing my onesie, waiting for an imaginary prince. Fantastic!I gasped as a gold chariot with a bright red horse trotted in the street. I continued gawking as it rolled on. He thrashed the horses restraints to stop in front of my driveway. Hello, young lad! The prince smiled.OK, Im trippin.What is this trip you speak of?Nothin. Why is the horse red?Why not?I sighed.Come on, get in, friend.""It's a school night.""Then, Ill have you home before curfew.WellDon't you want to go to a faraway kingdom?I looked at the brown-bearded prince. He wore a long burgundy robe.I didnt have homework, so I said, Alright, and got in.Off we go! Hewhipped the horseand we appeared in what looked tobe the sixteenth century.A huge white castle glittered in the sunlight. A moat with crystal clear water surrounded the magnificent structure. And a blankie of colorful flowers covered the land.Wow! I said as we crossed the bridge.Welcome tomy castle! Prince Panini Head hopped off the chariot andthrew the doors open. Golden sunshine poured through the windows. Do you like it, sir?It's awesome! I always wanted to visit a castle.Are you hungry? I could make you something.""You cook?Well, I have to since my parents are off fighting dragons.Im sorry.""I'm just glad I have a friend.I smiled.So, tell me about yourself.I thought you knew about me.I do, but I want to know more.""Um, OK.

Does thou need nourishment?No, thanks.Alright.So, `what now.I do not know; Ive never had a friend before.Never had a friend?Prince Pinnini Head shook his head. No, I never had. He turned around. Come on,there's still a lot to see!"" He showed me his bedroom, kitchen, and his courtyard. It was cool. I particularly liked the courtyard where people trained to be knights!And this is the dungeon, where thieves are imprisoned.The cells are empty.I just disposed of the bodies, and there hasnt been any thievery for days.Oh.Have you fenced before?No.Would you like to learn?Sure.He picked the sword up from the floor and handedit to me.If I attack you first, you try to parry or deflect my sword, then repost, or attack me.OK.Try it. He raised his sword and slashed at me.I slashedback andknocked his sword and hit his chest.Superb job, my lad!""Thanks, I replied and lashed out and he leaped back, my sword inches from his chest.You have a knack for this.Well, I playKnights of Elmore on Nintendo Switch.What is this you speak of?It's a video game. Youve never seen me play?No.How long haveyou watched me for?A couple days. It was after your mother readyou about me, I decided to reveal myself.But that story is a fairy tale. How could it be true?I had a potion made for Abby Liftyon that when she drank it,she knew about me and wrote that book.Wow! So she magically learned about you?Not exactly the information was disguised as something from her own imagination.Wow! Thats awesome!Indeed!What next?Are you hungry?A little.""Let's eat. Shall we?I followed him into the dining hall.I looked around andsighed.What's wrong?Nothing.""Your expression says otherwise.It's justthat my mommy feedsme dinner.Oh.Yeah.Would you like to return home?I opened my mouth to reply, but a huge roar erupted outside.What was that?The wall came down, and a green dragon soared in.I screamed as the beast flew over my head.It inhaledandbreathed a ring of fire. Prince PinniniHead drew his sword and slashed at its tail. The dragon whippedits tail, sending him crashing into the table.PRINCE PANINI HEAD! I shouted, and the dragon looked at me.Oh, shit!It growled, showing its blood-stained teeth, and snapped its jaws at me. I jumped and rushedout. BANG! The dragon crashed into something behind. My heart pounded as I dashed through the hall. The dragon bellowed as its rapid footstepsshook the floor. Imade it to the end and turnedinto the kitchen.I glancedback as the dragonbustedthrough the entry.ROOOAAARRR! The dragonlooked around. I pressed my body against the table as footsteps thudded on the floor.My heart was a congo drum, beating fast. I got on my hands and knees and crawled like the teenage baby I was. An oven was straight ahead.The dragon turned its head and roared.SHIT! I hollered and scrambled towards the oven.The dragon ran as I moved as fast as I could.I opened it and squinched in.I crouched down and slammed it shut.BANG!The impact shook like an earthquake.The dragon roaredthen I heard footsteps trotting away, thenSilence. I waited for a few seconds, then very slowly, opened the oven. I looked. No dragon. I jumped out and walked into the hall. Rubble was everywhere. The columns were damaged, Even the ceiling was smashed through.Then, I saw PrincePinninihead. A piece of a column trapped him. I ran over andtried lifting it. Thank Heaven you're alive!Let's celebrate when I get you out, I said and pulled. The chunk of stone startedto budge as I grunted and flexed my muscles. I lifted it up enough for the prince to move his leg out and I let go.Thank you, Sir Jade.""I leaned over and panted. No prob, is your leg alright?""It aches a bit, but I'll be fine.Good.""I looked around. Man, that dragon wrecked everything!Yes, sadly it did.""""I'm sorry.""It's alright. All that matters is your safety.""But your castle is half-gone.Ill have itrebuilt.""Alright... Hey, didn't you encounter a ghost that warned you must give up something valuable?""Yes, and I gave my cousin up.""What?He was annoying anyway.""You're joking, right?No.""OK, thenJade, dinner!'' Mommy called, and everything turned back into the dark driveway.""Comming, Mommy!"" I walked back to the porch.Why are you in your onesie outside?Well, I, umCome on. Your food is getting cold. You can tell melater. She motioned me in.Here's your bibby-wibby. She tied my choo-choo bib around my neck.Mommy?Yes, sweetie?I told her.Wow! So, that's what you were doing! My little adventurer! She pinched my cheeks.I giggled.It didnt matter if she believed me. All that mattered wasI made a new friend!"
Grim Truth,"It was a world different from the one we live in now, or we might someday come to, where consequences of ones lies and deceit were measured on the tiny book called Pselmatin that would follow you to till the end of time. The unspoken rule was that when a hundred lies were marked on your Pselmatin, it would complete the creation of a monster from the grim world of Gomorriah who would ultimately find you and eat you whole. Roman was no exception to the rule, but he considered himself too smart to exceed his lies over one hundred. In his youth, his family poorer than his attitude, worked hard to the bone, living honest and weak lives but for the deceptive boy, he only wanted to live on the contrary. So he lied, lied about the flourishing notes in his pocket, about the grain in his rice basket, about the linen of his shirt.His tireless father would warn him, If you keep this up, not even your tiny little truths can save you from the monster, and the real you will be no more.However, he would scoff, If I were you father, I would never want to find the real me. Years passed, and he grew up to be a vivacious and handsome lawman practicing the art of fabrication and shine, his beauty that was as perfect as his lies made him the best at his job. By this time, he had found various loopholes to save his lies and live vivaciously till he bore all the riches and fruits in the world, mostly through the charm and power he held over his words. His friend Bo, no different and more reckless, pressed on the same plan. As they both checked the number of strikes in their Pselmatins, they would triumph that it was all under control. But no matter, as an inevitable fate would have over such flawed humans, Bo had somehow hit the strike over hundred lies and he awaited the first fleeting hours, where the absent sign of an ineffable monster gave way to his turbulent sighs. Another set of days passed where there was still no appearance, and his heart filled with hope convinced it was a fluke after all. But as fate would have it, there came a day when the monster did come. Except it did not look anything like a dark devious monster but a spitting image of Bo himself and the trembling man crouched in fear to his successor, whose mouth grew large and swallowed the whole of him, his last cries hung like smoke in the air that seeped away into the vents and other quiet places.That night, Roman woke up abruptly unable to shake off an ominous feeling, he counted his lies again and ensured he was still many lies away from the impending doom.As he lived his days ahead he witnessed a very different Bo, frivolous and dark in all his movements; and from that, he knew his friends soul had succumbed to the fate they both secretly feared. He knew every word that came from this man, was a lie that he wanted to believe so he found himself growing silent and tenacious, unwanting the same doom upon him. From time to time, he felt a yearn to look into Bos eyes and see if his friend was in there somehow, but he couldnt pull himself to. But even a stringent human cant avoid the fate of overlooking his mistakes and Roman learned it was his time soon, from the moment his book shook in his pocket and it revealed he had crossed over one hundred lies. Numerous attempts were made, following tearing of pages in his book of lies, throwing the book into the sea, and even erasing the hundredth strike, but it was all in vain since the unsullied book always found its way back to him. So he waited and decided to hide in the confines of his wealthy home, preparing weapons and reading up on the rules over and over being a lawman hoping to find a way out from his miserable fate. Few days had passed and there was no shadow apart from his own at the house, but he still waited fervently. Few weeks had passed, and the absence of the intervention made him wonder if he imagined it all. Murmurs of conviction escaped his mouth as he wandered and stared across the dazzling moon amongst the hurriedly floating sky, he thought as slumber filled his mind and he lay rested. But in the early morning, it came, before the moon was to transpire, it waited at the foot of his bed. With the brush of the wind against his skin, he rose and met his lookalike, more handsome with glittering white teeth revealed at its snare, ready to feast upon him. As the figure took its step towards him, step by step, Roman inched back into the walls and begged, Please dont feast on me! Ill do anything.The figures sardonic laugh echoed across the sky, Its done, human. You asked for this fate.And in the contemplative moment, Roman remembered what he learned about the grim world, not of his own.You can live in this world instead of me, and let me go to yours. He cried.The figure paused, his smile dropped, You are willing to go to my world just to save your soul? I am simply a better version of your deceitful self. If you really wanted to keep your soul, you should have spoken some truth in your life.Please, give me a chance. I willingly give my place in this world to you., nothing scared Roman more than the monsters watering mouth at this point.The creature clasped his hand and closed his eyes in thought, And you will stay there and never come back?Yes, I have no choice. He stood straight.His monstrous twin held then sneered, This will be interesting. As you desire then.The moonlight that stayed embellished in the clouds revealed itself and all the light and dark surrounded him and before he knew it, he stood beside a well that faced a dark red forest. He looked below and saw a furry tail on the barren ground and saw it lead to his back. In fear, he turned around and saw his exchange was done and his reflection from the well frightened him. The reflection revealed to have a long black snout, red fur coat, and an incredibly long blue-tipped tail that wrapped around his feet.His pointy ears shook as he heard a shudder behind him, causing him to yell and run into the forest with the eyes on the forest leaves following his trail. A raging storm danced above him and the wind chased him further into the center when he saw a small town filled with figures that roamed and howled in the night. The town presented many creatures that confused Roman as they appeared to be features that were part human as well an animal of many kinds;  He guessed; for some creatures, the appearance seemed to be in a continuous cycle where the human features diminished and then grew back. His belly ached as loaves of bread and honey nectar were presented in shops, but none gave him any as he asked. But instead, they were surprised at his appearance.A rabbit with the eyes and ears of a woman stared at him inquisitively, Why do you look like that?Like what? He held his breathYoure a fully formed Fox with no human features. Thats odd.Roman knew why.Afraid of being asked more questions he puffed his chest and planned to charm his way but what came out of his mouth surprised him, Well its even odd youve got human ears that are so despiteful to look at. Where are your bunny ears?. He ran out back into the forest once the cross creature chased him away. Another creature who possessed shelter had asked what he thought of his dream to dance despite having duck feet, Romans words knew no bounds other than the truth. Grim truth, one might say.Each truth he spoke made his heart clench in pain and he wondered that for some reason, the gift of lies he grew years on, did not find its place here despite this world being ever ready to welcome it. He wasnt quite sure what it was; he was convinced the monster had cursed him of some kind, where he could no longer speak lies and only the truth. He decided.So it became difficult to survive in the hazardous world, where no one listened to his truth or accepted his company cause he spoke only the truth. He was convinced that he was right all along to live vivaciously through his lies because honesty was never benefiting one. Each day, he got a beating to his chest and a slash across his face as one would laugh, calling him the fox who can't lie. While he scampered around for loaves, his outfit would tear from branches that teased and when a conceited apple branch would ask for compliments in return of an apple, he would reply with his voice struggling, My O-Oh My You are indeed the prettie-pettiest branch of all. and then he would close his eyes to not want to face the thwack coming his way from the grim hands. He would cry out loud on his way home, feeling ashamed and exposed to his true thoughts, his large tail circling his face. One day as he managed to get nectar from the bees who were easier to please, he held his pot close to his chest and skipped home to make sure he didn't bump into the headless grizzlies or the armless monkeys. He found a shade and came across a Gomorran that was almost a full skunk who saw his glass and begged, Oh Fox with the glass of sweet nectar from the bees, I beg you to give me a drink! cried the skunk.Roman denied her cries and went into his straw hut that stood still for once and poured the deliciously sweet honey into his cup but as he put the cup to his tongue he felt a shuffle behind him, revealing the same begging eyes and crooked teeth yearning for a drink. It was the first time he saw any weakness in this world and he gave her the cup declaring it to be the last time. The skunk took off in glee and Roman did not feel as empty as his grumbling stomach did.  Days passed and he came across a cross-eyed wolf creature who deviously asked him questions which he knew asked for a beating. As his unfortunate tongue would bring Roman doom, the wolf prepared to assail and a cloud of green mist rained causing the wolf to yelp and run away from the stinking air. Thankful for her intervention, the two soon become each others comrades but the skunk never asked him to speak the truth about herself, and Roman in turn, never asked why she did not have any other friends. But one day, the skunk gathered up her courage and asked him what he thought of her. Roman feared what would escape his grim heart and the words flew faster than the lightning that would hit Gomorriah every hour, You-You have the worst scent I have ever come across. Worse enough to make me feel that I might pass out every time I sit beside you.Hurt from his words the skunk ran off and Roman cried and bit his tongue in despair. He searched many moons to look for his tiny friend but there was no sign. He cried to the moon one night wishing if he just had one more chance to speak his heart and as if his wish was granted, his friend presented herself. My dear friend, he held his hand to his chest, You might have the stinkiest scent in this land, but that is your weapon. Your kindness is no match for a horrible friend like myself.But I am willing to bear all the green mist in the world just be next to you. Touched, the skunk came closer and they embraced. And for once Roman felt what it was like to be happily honest. And as the moon paled into the clouds he felt his figure pale and transparent. What is happening? he looked at his body in surprise.The skunk prophesized in a sardonic tone, It seems you have spoken enough truths to go back to your world. Roman couldnt believe it and held tighter to his friend. I dont know if that world will accept me anymore.The skunk smiled and held his hand, As long as you are ready to be a good soul, your truths will be fruitful. Dont lie vivaciously anymore and take courage to accept your weakness you silly foxAnd that was the best truth he had ever received in all his life. The moonbeam kissed all of him and he was surrounded by all light and dark; before he knew it, he was standing on the floor of his home and his shadow painted a man he once knew. He felt something shake in his pocket and looked at the tiny book of Pselmatin and saw it was empty of strikes. Trodding lightly he looked around and saw his first sunlight in what must have been a long time. He held his chest and knew that although his heart went through the pain it also grew stronger.By abandoning the ways of lying that came so easily to him, he decided to rather live an honest and difficult life and love his true soul. What one might forget is that when we lie, apart from hurting others, we are hurting ourselves the most on the inside and that was something he vowed to never do."
The cat and the ladder,"Gather round now, come, oh children dear,Come come, come now, from far and near,A story I need tell to thee,A story that is full of glee.But why, you ask? Why should you care?About a little story of despair?Because, so happens you and meCould find ourselves akin to he.So, listen now and listen well,To my own story, which Ill tell. Not far from here, quite near our town,Right where Clown river turns blue and brown,Next to the rapids, yes, thats it,Where you can find good fish to eat.There lived a ratter, small and thickHis name, I believe was Slicky Nick.And next to Nicks, n another house,Lived his good friend, Morose the Mouse.And friends they were, quite through and through,When fields were green or they felt blue. One faithful day, though full of joy,Morose was feeling rather coy.Whats wrong? asked Nick, the slicky slick.Where has your cheer gone, oh, so quick?I feel quite blue! answered Morose,As he bent over, hiding his nose.Can you not feel the sweet embrace?Just sniff, its right there in your face!And sniff he did, and  what surprise!Gruyere, Gouda, Roncal, not one, but thrice. Oh, sweet Morose, my dear good friend,Is this whats got youn such a bend?Oh, Nick the Slick, dont laugh at me,Even the clouds, look! arent they Brie?!Oh, poor Morose, dont be distraught,Come, come! No! No! We wont get caught!And down they went, past tree, through ditch,Up hill, through hedge, up stairs and flip, a switch!First toe, then foot, a knee, a clawa whisker, tail, tip toe, tip toe,Inside they went, the faithful friends. Inside towards their faithful ends. At first, no words, escaped their mouths,Their minds held tight in wonderous shrouds.A second passed, then two, then three,Morose exclaimed, Oh, Nick! Look Brie!Not only Brie, but CamembertAnd Swiss, Gouda. Is that, Lambert?Oh, cheese Louise, they felt in heavenAnd stuffed their mouths, enough for seven.The time thus passed, from mouth to nibble,Sleep came, a drip and then a dribble. Embraced they slept, so peaceful, true.Poor sods, they really didnt have a clue.For in that moment, Maurice awoke,Who was Maurice? Hah, he was no joke!Maurice the cat, a hateful fellow,His soul awash, and bitter, yellow.He ran the shop, that sold the cheese,But in this morning, quelle surprise!Instead of Cheddar, Colby, Gouda,Morose the Mouse ensnared with Judah! What is the meaning here, you two!Whats happened to my sweet Dorblu?Morose awoke, his heart a thunder,Poor Nick, was still asleep, no wonder.He had consumed a whole Gruyere,What reason had he had to share?!But poor Morose, he understood,To reason with Maurice no good.Still clutched to Sleepy Nicks chest, tight,He said farewell to worlds delight. No! Stop! Let go! Let go of me!Let loose you scoundrel, set me free!As Morose thrashed, Slick Nick awoke,Hey you, stop it! Whats with this joke?Let go! Let go! You mass of fur!Let go! Let go! Stop it, you cur!Edam, Comte, Feta, my precious Swiss!Where is it all? Whys it amiss?Let go! Let go! Let go you fool!Let go! Let go! Im not your tool! Nick heard a squirm, a beg, a curse,Confused, held tight to sweet Morose.Ok, I give! Please hurt me not!Ill pay the price for what Ive wrought.Maurice he turned, a hateful stare,Their hearts just shrunk, unlike a hare.What is the meaning here, you two?!Where is my precious Yorkshire Blue?Nicks mouth went wide as if to talk,Moroses kick signaled him: do not. Youve caught me swine, let loose your squeeze,I will repent, just let me breathe!Nicks grip unlaced, the Mouse sat down,He turned to face Maurices frown.I snuck in here quite late last night,I ate my full, twas pure delight.I ate and ate, throughout the dark,I meant to leave your cupboards stark.This scoundrel heard my lustful thinking,He crept inside, attacked, unblinking. Nick sat quite still, he dared not move,All knew the makers fame: obtuse.We fought and fought! Morose went on,Our struggle almost reached the dawn!But in our valid struggle fell,Sleep came, enveloped us so well.And then you came, all yell and clanker,My only chance to run, you hamper.Take heed you beasts, Ill never wail,Im caught, farewell, Ill go to jail. Slick Nick was stunned, knew not to say,Morose was caught, hip hip hooray!You wretched fool, you thief, you scoundrel,Youll face my wrath! Youll know my mandrel!Maurice, he screamed, reached for his tool,Stop, Father. Stop! Your wishs vengeances far too cruelHis daughter beckoned from behind,A womans heart, her fate: just blind.The coppers came and seized the Mouse,But Maurices anger would not douse. Two weeks from then, Morose would hang,Maurices hate his time had rang.But what of Nick, Slick Nick the cat?Would he for friendship, tit for tat?Oh, yes, oh, yes! I swear to thee!Morose, who mine own brother chose to be.I swear on blood and sweat and tear,Close to my heart no onell come near.I swear, till breath leaves far from chest,My darkened heaves will have no rest. A grave dug in his soul so deep,No sip of light would ever creep.He lived his lie, day in, day out,He hated life, of that, no doubt.A hero, he soon came to be,Slick Nick the Savior of Brie.But in his heart, forever mournful,He lived each day, undoubtedly scornful.He swore, hed climb the ladder high,He swore, hed not stop till the sky. The lies went on, as steps he clamberedHis heart by truth, no longer hampered.Maurices heart he soon just melted,And from its core a friendship smelted.Day in, day out, the lies went on,His doubts and fears forever gone.From Cheddar, Tilsit, ProvoleneTo Stilton, Feta, Saint Maure dTouraine.He lived the lies, each day new muster,For he would want their lives to master. The days went on, then weeks, then years,Maurice then blessed Nick and his daughter, dears.The lie became part of his truth,His heart and mind not one but deuce.The years passed on, the lies forgotten,But in his heart all days were rotten.From sip to drip, to trickle, swell,Where rage would pour, itd form a dell.The day then came, his task complete,He then sat down, prepared to sleep. Thats it then children, the storys done,A meaning Ill make sure youve won.In life embrace both good and bad,Embrace as well what makes you sad.Run not from truths, for they set free,While lies just strangle, yes, you agree!Tis here my story ends, abruptIts truth I hope, was not for naught.Be true to love, be true to thee,Just like Morose, not Nick of Brie."
The Traveling Rock,"You hold me in your hand glaring and about to throw me. I may be a small pebble but I was once big. Some people think that small things are really annoying. Me, I think it might be an easier way to move around. I didnt mean to hurt your foot, I just needed a ride to explore. I like to move around and see different things. I used to think staying in one spot was the thing to do but now I want to know what all there is out there. My only problem is that everywhere I go I leave a piece of me behind.Before I was in your hand getting ready to be tossed, I was in your shoe. It was nice and warm. I did feel like I was in there for a while and covered many miles. I tried to stay at the side so I wouldnt be noticed. I kept thinking about what adventure I would see next. With all the moving around you did it became hard to stay put and I got exited enough to move under your heal. I know I cause a sharp pain by the way you jumped. Even though I am smooth and small as a pea you took me out of your shoe.Before I was in your shoe, I was tossed out into an alley way. Many garbage trucks drove over me and made the small cracks grow so that some of me chipped away. I waited for the perfect person to walk by so I could hop into their shoe. The sun was hot and it reminded me of the days of when I began. I lost track of how many days I was stuck out there but I knew with enough patients I would be off and running soon. I seen you walk down the alley kicking up dust and found it the perfect opportunity to hitch a ride.Before I was in the alley, I lived in a fish tank. Thank goodness I can withstand moisture as much as I can withstand the sun. Fish swam by me all day and night. It was nice to hear the bubbling water. I would get removed from time to time to have the algae washed off of me. The washing felt good and when it was over I went back into the tank. When a fish would die it would get replaced by another. One day the owners decided to quit replacing them and the tank got so lonely. Less and less fish doing swirls and bobbing up and down to occupy my time. I found myself alone oneday and then I was tossed out into the alley. I waited for someone to notice me and take me home or for someone that I could hitch a ride with.Before I was in the fish tank, I was sitting in a shop to be bought. People picked me up and put me back down several times until you seen me and brought me home. It was such a relief because some people had really dirty hands. I was tossed in the air once by some young person thinking it was funny. I sure didnt see the humor in it. I did enjoy how you admired my strength. I believe you called me a paper weight. I held down stacks of papers for you when you working around fans. Then your kid took me outside to play ball with and broke me up and he tried to hide me in the fish tank. I guess I looked good there because that is where I stayed for years.Before I was in the store, I was a statue. I was on display for people to see. People would come around and stare at me. Pictures were taken and I think maybe an article or two were written. I felt warm inside knowing that many people admired me. There were people of all sorts, sizes, and ages. The littlest ones would run around me and play games. The older ones would take forever to walk around with their canes. So many stories that I heard from people, sometimes I would imagine they were talking about me. I did not care for how I got to be a statue. A guy with the chisel and file worked day and night for a long time to get me looking spectacular. Then I was pulled down for some reason and something else went up in my place. When I was pulled down, I fell apart into many pieces. The pieces looked cool I guess and thats how I ended up in a store.Before I was a statue, I was a huge boulder. I sat in a pile with many others taking in the quietness of the forest around. It was a way different spot than where I began my journey. I couldnt see as much. After a spell I got used to my new surroundings. I still had the cold night and the warmth of the sun. People started to show up disturbing my new found peace. Me and others like me were picked through by people to decorate their homes. I was one who was made into a statue.Before I was a boulder, I was on top of the world. I sat high on a mountain. So many sunsets and sunrises. Little chipmunks would scurry across me and eat their nuts. A passing elk would bugle from time to time. The cold air would cause their breath to show in the early morning. Rain would always make things greener and the air more crisp. Winter was cold, but it never really bugged me. Sitting up so high I could watch everything. I couldnt think of anything else I wanted to do other than to watch the storm clouds moving in and out, see the birds flying in the wind, hear the sounds of the trees talking in the wind, and most of all enjoy the solitude. Then one day loud blasts and huge machines came. They tore up the mountain side for a road and I was carried away to a pile."
Wild Kelpies in the sea,"Hugo listened and sighed. He listened closely; his breath was deep and slow, in the powerful rhythm of the waves of the evening sea rushing towards the stony shore. The diffuse twilight of an early spring evening made it hard to make out individual waves in the living breathing mass of the sea.A family with two small children was gathering up their toys, before they left accompanied by the fading light. A lonely hiker was urging his unwilling dog to jump into the car, parked nearby. Eventually, all the noise died away, the lights of the cars lost themselves in the sky, until they were feeble fingers groping around the twilight.Hugo sighed again, his face warmed by sweet remembrance. Caroline checked her watch for the umps-time and restlessly strolled up and down the small path made of shells and white pebbles that ran behind the bench on which Hugo was sitting and sighing. The path stood out against the darkness, but right now, she was insusceptible to the lure of this grand place.It is nearly dark, dad, she remarked urgently. Her best friend, Sarah, was having some friend s over to celebrate her birthday tonight. She didnt want to be lateYes, darling, this is the best time. Caroline directed her steps back to the bench. The best time for what, dad? Its getting colder by the minute. Hugo smiled without diverting his gaze from the sea. To glimpse .-To glimpse what?! Caroline retorted exasperated by her aging father. Truth was she couldnt stand to see him age. She could not bear to see time nibbling at his brilliance, overgrowing it with senility. It made her feel so weak. This was why she dreaded family weekends, was afraid of what changes to her father this week might bring. This was also why she was desperate to get to the noisiness of Sarahs party which would help her to forget the stale melancholy her father seemed to radiate.This time her father turned around. His smile was still there, lighting up his eyes, mild sternness on his brow. The Kelpies, of course. Have you forgotten all about them? For a moment Caroline stared at him, half angry, half lost. But the memories of long bygone days spent at the seaside tugged at her, pulled her closer towards the edge of the cliff. The light was nearly gone, the fresh promising, but still cool, air of a late April evening by the sea made her shudder when she slid onto the bench next to Hugo. No, she whispered. I havent forgotten. Hugo saw her eyes kindled by the same light that made his shine like a beacon and nodded, satisfied, before turning back to the breath of the waves. Carolines eyes were wide open. Her new green summer dress bore multiple stains defying her moms hope that grass stains would not show on a green dress. There are two, dad! A mother and a young one! She exclaimed excitedly, pointing with her chubby fingers. Hugo was kneeling next to her, one arm around her small shoulders to shield her from the sea breeze. Yes, darling, I see them, he said softly. What do you think they are doing here?-Resting from their journey, of course! Caroline exclaimed, impatient at her fathers lack of understanding. She became concerned. They must have lost the others, their herd, dad. Hugo smiled reassuringly and shook his head. I dont think so. Every year, one single foal is born to the herd of Kelpies roaming these coasts. And every year when the foal is one winter old, its mother accompanies it to the place where it is henceforth to guard its treasure.  Guard its treasure? Caroline interjected excitingly. We must search for the treasure.  No, not today. That would be very unfair towards the young guardian, wouldnt it?- But how will it guard the treasure? Will its mother leave it? Hugo inclined his head, thoughtfully, thinking that this might be the seed of a new story he could add to his volume of fairytales that was already approved for publication. He was still for a moment contemplating the unlikely turn his career as an author had taken a couple of years ago when he had decided to work with this brilliant Scandinavian illustrator and bring out a volume of fairytale retellings. Now, the stories would not leave him alone anymore. It was like suddenly his everyday life was flooded with a waggish fairy tint. Every time it was about to fade, his girls would reignite it for him. As Caroline had just done. They stood still on the cliff and observed the black Kelpie foal galloping over the waves boisterously, splashing the water against the cliff.Years later, at another shore Caroline took the hand of her father. Their fur is glistening, wet from the sea where the last light of the day touches it. Their manes are like wild seagrass, spreading pitch black in the salty water. She quoted from her memory. I think I see them, right there. She said half teasing, half serious. Hugo pressed her hand. Me, too, he murmured. We never returned to look for the treasure, Caroline remarked. Maybe you will go one day. Hugos eyes were twinkling. Dad, you should take up writing again. Caroline said, suddenly hopeful. Hugo smiled, listened to the sea for a long moment and then sighed. No, he said decidedly. I dont need to. I live in fairytales now. Carolines smile faded. This is saddening and consoling in equal parts she said accusingly. Hugo put his arm around her shoulders. Dont forget the Kelpies, he said and his warmth dispelled the sadness rising in Carolines chest. She leaned against him, just like so many years ago. The fairy tint was still there, leaving a dim but perceptible shimmer on the beautiful landscape.Lets go. You will be late for your party, he said, took her hand and pulled her gently towards the car."
"The Princess, The Bear, & The Witch","Long ago, there was a tsardom by the sea. The tsardom was a happy and fruitful land. Every season at harvest, the crops were fresh and plentiful. The rivers were beautiful and filled with the cleanest drinking water. The people were happy. Every person was welcome in their neighbors home. The children laughed as they played in the field. They celebrated every holiday with enthusiasm and festive jubilation. Most importantly, they loved their tsar. The Tsar was a good tsar who was very kind to his people. The land prospered because of his wisdom and kindness. The Tsar had a beautiful daughter named Princess Marina.Princess Marina had long, brown hair and deep blue eyes. Not only was Princess Marina the prettiest girl in the whole tsardom, she was also the most talented. She was the best dancer, 89the best flute player, and the best singer in the tsardom. Everyone loved Princess Marina because of her gifts and because she was kind, like her father.One year, winter came early to the tsardom. It was a bitterly cold winter with heavy snowfall. One night, a strong wind swept through the Tsars castle, chilling the Tsar. The tsar became very weak and sick and could not leave his bed. No matter how hard they tried, they could not make the Tsar warm and Tsars wisest doctors thought he might die. Princess Marina scared and sad for her father. She held his hand as he laid in bed, crying and begging him to not die. The Tsar told his daughter that one day she would become Tsarina over the land. He instructed her to rule over the people with love and wisdom. She promised that she would.	The Tsar also told Princess Marina secret. He told her that if something was wrong with the Tsardom and she cannot fix it on her own, she can fix it with the help from Baba Yaga because she has the power to make wishes come true. He told her the way to find Baba Yaga, which is to follow the river past the mountains and to the forest. Once she is in the forest, she needs to keep walking until it gets so cold that she can no longer bear it. Then, she will see house built on chicken legs, with the back of the house facing her. She must then command the house to turn around to face her. After it turns around, Baba Yaga will come out of the house and ask her what she wants. Princess Marina can ask for whatever she wants, but the Tsar warned her that Baba Yaga will take something very valuable from her. The Tsar made Princess Marina promise him that she would not visit Baba Yaga to save him, but only to see her for the good of the Tsardom.	That night, all Princess Marina could think about was going to see Baba Yaga to save her father, but she did not want to break her promise and disobey him. She realized though, that saving her father would be best for the tsardom. She sneaked out of the castle in the middle of the night and followed the path to Baba Yaga. She followed the river, went through the mountains, and walked through the forest.	The forest was very dark and cold and none of the trees had any leaves on them. When she got deeper into the woods, a bear came into Princess Marinas path. The bear was extremely large and brandished razor-sharp teeth.	The bear growled and said, I am very hungry! If you do not give me food, I will eat you up! Princess Marina was not scared because she knew exactly what to do.	She responded, Bear, I do not have any food to give you, but I can give you something much better than food. Princess Marina began to dance. She had never danced so elegantly and beautifully in all of her life. As she danced, the bear sat down, smiled, and clapped its paws.	When she was finished dancing, the bear said, I am filled with joy so I will not eat you. The bear thanked Princess Marina and wandered off to another direction in the forest.	As she walked deeper into the forest, Princess Marina got colder and colder. When she got so cold that she could no longer bear it, she noticed a strange looking house that stood on chicken legs with the back of the house facing Princess Marina.	Princess Marina said, Baba Yaga, I command you to turn your house around! The house began to turn around and was eventually facing Princess Marina. The front door opened and a woman stepped out and walked down the stairs to stand next to Princess Marina. Baba Yaga was a very old and very ugly woman. She was tall, thin, and had bony, claw-like fingers.	What is it that you want, my dear? said Bab Yaga.	Baba Yaga, my father is the Tsar and he is very kind and wise ruler. This cold weather has made him very sick and he wont live much longer. I wish that you can make him better.	Baba Yaga smiled and slyly said, Yes, I can make that happen, but you must sacrifice something valuable to me if you want your wish to come true. Princess Marina had brought a beautiful doll, one of her favorites, to give to Baba Yaga.	I will sacrifice this doll, said Princess Marina.	I do not want this doll, said Baba Yaga. You are the princess, so you have a thousand dolls just like this, which means it is not valuable.	What is it that you want? asked Princess Marina.	If you want to save your father, you must sacrifice your ability to dance, said Baba Yaga. Princess Marina agreed to the terms.	Baba Yaga laughed an evil laugh and said, it is done. She put her bony hand over Princess Marinas eyes and Princess Marina fell asleep.	When Princess Marina woke up, she was laying comfortably in her warm bed at the castle. Just then, the Tsar walked in her room. He looked happy and healthy. Princess Marina became so joyed.	Father, are you not ill? she asked.	No, it is a miracle! The cold winter has ended and the season is warm again! exclaimed a happy tsar. This is cause for a celebration. Get out of bed, Princess! Let us have a dance. When Princess Marina tried to get out of bed, she noticed that her feet were missing. She began to cry. The Tsar promised her that he would get the best carpenter in the land to carve her new feet made out of wood. Though Princess Marina learned how to walk with her new wooden feet, she still could not dance.	Even though the warm weather was a nice change, the sun became hotter and hotter. The sun became so hot that the river started to dry and the crops started to die. The people became sad and worried because they had nothing to eat or drink. Princess Marina did not like seeing her people suffer, so she decided to go visit Baba Yaga again. She followed the dried river, went through the mountains, and went through the dark forest.	When she got deep into the forest, the bear came to Princess Marina and was growling and showing its teeth. Give me food, barked the bear, or Ill eat you up! Princess Marina was not scared because she knew what to do.	Bear, I do not have any food to give you, but I can give you something much better than food. Princess Marina brought her flute with her and she began to play a song for the bear. She had never played so elegantly and beautifully in all of her life. As she played, the bear sat down, smiled, and clapped its paws.	When she was finished playing the flute, the bear said, I am filled with joy so I will not eat you. The bear thanked Princess Marina and wandered off to another direction in the forest.	As Princess Marina walked deeper and deeper into the forest, she got colder and colder. When she got so cold that she could no longer bear it, she saw the house on chicken legs with the back facing her.	Princess Marina said, Baba Yaga, I command you to turn your house around! The house turned around as it did before. Baba Yaga opened the door and came down the stairs.	What is it that you want, my dear? said Bab Yaga.	Baba Yaga, the tsardom cannot grow crops and the river is drying up. The people are hungry and thirsty. Can you make it so that the tsardom will not go hungry or thirsty?	Baba Yaga smiled and slyly said, Yes, I can make that happen, but you must sacrifice something valuable to me if you want your wish to come true. Princess Marina showed Baba Yaga the same flute she used to play for the bear. It was made from gold and had jewels.	I will sacrifice this flute, said Princess Marina.	I do not want this flute, said Baba Yaga. I cannot play the flute, so it has no value to me.	What is it that you want? asked Princess Marina.	If you want your people to eat and drink, you must sacrifice your ability to play the flute, said Baba Yaga. Princess Marina agreed to the terms.	Baba Yaga laughed an evil laugh and said, it is done. She put her bony hand over Princess Marinas eyes and Princess Marina fell asleep.	When Princess Marina woke up, she was in her warm bed at the castle. Her father was in her room with her to tell her some good news. The Tsar was good friends with a king over another land. The Kings name was King Karl. His kingdom had extra crops and water that he could give the Tsar to feed his people. In exchange, King Karl wanted Princess Marina to marry his eldest son, Prince Wilhelm. The Tsar was so excited to see his daughter get married that he wanted her to play the flute for him. When Princess Marina went to grab her flute, she noticed that her hands were missing. She began to cry but the Tsar promised her that his best carpenter would make wooden hands for her. Although her new hands could hold things, she could no longer play the flute.	After she married Prince Wilhelm, Princess Marina learned that her husband was not a good man. He was not kind and wise like her father, but was mean spirited and dull in thought. He mocked Princess Marina for her wooden hands and feet. Princess Marina was sad to be married to Prince Wilhelm, but she knew she had to keep King Karl happy to feed the people.	One day, Prince Wilhelm left on a ship to go visit his friends back home. While he was gone, Princess Marina decided to visit Baba Yaga. She followed the dried river, went through the mountains, and walked through the dark forest.	As she walked through the forest, the bear walked came to her again. The bear growled and showed its teeth. I am hungry! said the bear, give me food or Ill eat you up! Princess Marina was not scared because she knew what to do.	Bear, I do not have any food to give you, but I can give you something much better than food. Princess Marina began to sing a song for the bear. She had never sang so elegantly and beautifully in all of her life. As she sang, the bear sat down, smiled, and clapped its paws.	When she was finished singing, the bear said, I am filled with joy so I will not eat you. The bear thanked Princess Marina and wandered off to another direction in the forest.	Princess Marina kept walking until she got so cold she could no longer bear it. She saw Baba Yagas house and commanded it to turn around. The house turned around and Baba Yaga came down to greet Princess Marina.	What is it that you want, my dear? said Bab Yaga.	Baba Yaga, my husband is mean to me. One day he will be the tsar of my people and I think he will be an evil ruler. Can you make it so I will be married to a good man?	Baba Yaga smiled and slyly said, Yes, I can make that happen, but you must sacrifice something valuable to me if you want your wish to come true. Princess Marina showed Baba Yaga a necklace she was wearing. It was elegant, shiny, and made from large diamonds.	I will sacrifice this necklace, said Princess Marina.	I do not want this necklace, said Baba Yaga. Every girl that comes to me always wants to sacrifice jewelry. I do not want any more jewelry.	What is it that you want? asked Princess Marina.	If you want to have a good husband, you must sacrifice your singing ability, said Baba Yaga. Princess Marina agreed to the terms.	Baba Yaga laughed an evil laugh and said, it is done. She put her bony hand over Princess Marinas eyes and Princess Marina fell asleep.	When Princess Marina woke up, she was in her warm bed at the castle. Her father came into her room with news. He told her that Prince Wilhelms ship had went down in the sea. He also told her that King Karl would still give the tsardom food and water if she would marry his second eldest son, Prince Bjorn. Princess Marina agreed. The happy Tsar told Princess Marina that he wanted to celebrate by hearing her sing. When she tried to sing, no sound came out of her mouth. Princess Marina began to cry.	After the wedding, Princess Marina soon learned that Prince Bjorn was a good man. He was sweet to Princess Marina and kind to everyone he spoke to. He was also wise like the Tsar. Princess Marina was very happy to be married to such a loving person. However, she noticed that was sad. Whenever he wanted to dance with Princess Marina at parties, he sat with her to keep her company. Whenever he wanted to play music with her, they read books instead. Whenever he wanted to sing with her, they went on walks instead. Because he loved the Princess so much, he pretended to be happy, but Princess Marina knew he was sad. She loved him and wanted him to be happy. She decided to go to Baba Yaga.	She followed the dried river, went through the mountains, and walked through the dark forest. The bear approached her and growled. Im so hungry, said the bear, give me food or Ill eat you up! Princess Marina was scared and did not know what to do.	Princess Marina said, Bear, I do not have any food, but I can give you something better. She leaned in and kissed the bear on the cheek. The bear began to transform into a person. Princess Marina saw that the bear now looked exactly like her. It had the same face, hair, and wooden hands and feet. The only difference is that the bear had brown eyes instead of the Princesss blue eyes. Princess Marinas look alike then ran away into the forest.	When Princess Marina walked until it got so cold that she could not bear it, she saw Baba Yagas house. She commanded it to turn around and greeted Baba Yaga when she came out of the house.	What is it that you want, my dear? said Bab Yaga.	Baba Yaga, my husband is sad. He is a good man and I want him to be happy. Can you make him happy?	Baba Yaga smiled and slyly said, Yes, I can make that happen, but you must sacrifice something valuable to me if you want your wish to come true.	I can give you a kiss, said Princess Marina.	You cannot give me a kiss, said Baba Yaga. Your kisses only belong to your husband.	What is it that you want? asked Princess Marina.	If you want your husband to be happy, you must sacrifice your life, said Baba Yaga. Princess Marina was scared. She did not want to die, but really wanted her husband to be happy. She agreed to the terms.	Baba Yaga laughed an evil laugh and said, it is done. She put her bony hand over Princess Marinas eyes and Princess Marina fell asleep.	Princess Marina woke up. She was in her warm bed at the castle. She removed her covers and saw that her feet came back to her. Her hands were there too. She tried to sing and a beautiful note came out of her mouth. Prince Bjorn ran into her room and said that he felt happy today. The held a party where they danced together, played music together, and sang together. That evening, Princess Marina and Prince Bjorn walked on the beach. They talked about how happy they were together and discussed what they wanted to name their future children.	As they walked on the beach, the waves washed something up on the shore. Princess Marina saw that it was wooden feet and wooden hands. As she stared at it, she noticed a puddle of water next to the them and saw her reflection. She saw that she had brown eyes.	Prince Bjorn grabbed her hand and kissed her. He told her that he loved her and walked her back to the castle.	They lived happily ever after."
The Painting,"During days long past, Bertrand lived alone in a manor house outside a quaint country town. Bertrand stood handsome, tall, wealthy, and strong. Living alone was not his choice. Many said he drove women away being so possessive because of jealousy. His only marriage lasted a few years before she took their son and ran away with another man. Since she left, he reached the point of isolation. Settling into a routine at home, he spent his days inside minding the house and the staff. He tried to learn painting but failed. His attempts to learn magic arts left him frustrated. He journeyed into town only for needs. Bertrand began enjoying his isolation. He grieved his lost son, but that situation was hopeless. One night attempting a magic spell, the housekeeper informed Bertrand someone knocked at the front door. Perturbed at the disturbance, he walked through the foyer to open the door. The weather outside stormed. Thunder and lightning rattled and shook the house. Who could be knocking at the door in this weather, Bertrand wondered? He contemplated a weapon but decided against it. He was shocked when he opened the front door. Before him stood an old crag dressed in ratty clothes. She was soaked, looking pitiful. What do you want? Bertrand asked. Id like a moment of shelter, till then rain passes, she said. Out of the question, Bertrand answered. The old womans eyes lit bright as she mumbled a few words. Bertrand did not remember how or why he let her into the house. He just remembers her standing inside, dripping on the carpet. What just happened? Bertrand demanded. How did you get in here? The old woman shimmered, and light swirled around her. Bertrand went for a weapon when the old woman stopped him. You are not in danger. Turn and look at me. You are in for a surprise, She said. Turning around, Bertrand beheld a stunning beauty. Long flowing red hair covered an hourglass figure. Green eyes danced with mischief. Who are you? Bertrand asked. I am a witch from the forest. We heard your pathetic efforts at spells. I volunteered to come teach you. My name is Katherine. I am staying until you have mastered basic magic, she said. My pathetic spells? Bertrand stammered. Yes, pathetic, even bad, Katherine said. Some caused problems in the forest. Others mutated animals. This happened because you did not know what you cast or how far it would go. We will fix that. How do I know I can trust you? Bertrand asked. You dont, Katherine said. After breakfast tomorrow, we begin. Katherine looked at the housekeeper and said, Where shall I put my things? The housekeeper looked at Bertrand, who nodded. The housekeeper responded, Come follow me, madam.Katherine followed the housekeeper down the hall to the guest rooms. Here is your room Maam. I will come for you in the morning for breakfast. With that the housekeeper departed. The next morning, the housekeeper lead Katherine into the dining hall where Bertrand waited. Breakfast will now be served, said the housekeeper. Breakfast consisted of eggs, a meat and bread. It was simple but good. Katherine learned to expect the same meal each morning. The food tasted wonderful yet dull. It was a mans house. The meals, based on meat and a starch, while tasting good never varied. Katherine understood Bertrands situation with the former wife. The former wife ran a house based on creativity and spontaneity. Meals became events. Food from the four corners of the earth graced the table. Maybe to compensate for her leaving, Bertrand required meals opposite from his former wife. Magic training began after breakfast and lasted till lunch. The difficulty of the spells and potions increased daily. Accidents happened frequently but with little damage. Katherines skills countered mistakes, preventing damage. Bertrand began to realize his teacher was quite accomplished in the magical arts. Her grace and competence in her skills impressed him. How did I rate such an accomplished teacher? Bertrand asked. We realized that you were performing well considering there wasnt a teacher, Katherine said. The mistakes you made, happened because you experimented alone. We believed the potential existed for you becoming a great wizard. The coven chose me to help you because of my skills as both a witch and a teacher. Bertrand winched at the words witch and wizard. He never thought of becoming a wizard. He wanted to develop magic to consume time. Living alone, even with a staff, began to wear on him. He found the presence of the witch both comforting and invigorating. Daily lessons became both a challenge and pleasurable. Most days they worked twice a day, after breakfast and either afternoon or evening, depending on the lesson. Katherine explained she belonged to a coven in the nearby woods. She had duties there requiring her absence at times. Bertrand discovered his disappointment at her absences. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months of training. Bertrands skills increased in large increments. Katherine found herself pushing him more. Her pushing resulted in Bertrand becoming a promising wizard. But more then skills grew between them. They gazed at each other longer, touches lingered moments longer. Feelings developed that surprised both. Katherine suggested they leave the castle for meals and entertainment. Conversations lasted long into the night. Then one night The new feeling burst from hiding. Katherine lost her footing and fell into Bertrand. He caught her by taking her into his arms and holding her till he was sure she was safe. Katherine, for part, eased into his embrace. Pent up passion exploded from both. They both stepped back blushing. Bertrand apologized for taking advantage of her. Dear Bertrand, you cannot do anything to me without my consent, Katherine said. I am powerful beyond your imagination, so much more then you. With that she eased back into his arms. Bertrand took her back allowing his passion life.The staff rejoiced at the blossoming romance, while distant because of her being a powerful witch. They reserved judgement of Bertrands possessing true desire and not under a spell. The romance continued to grow but as fate decrees, something went wrong. Bertrand took Katherine to a party of the rich and powerful in the small town. Bertrand beamed with pride at the woman with the flowing red hair on his arm. Looks of jealousy came from all the men. Katherine felt his discomfort and whispered in Bertrands ear, Dont let their looks bother you. I am here with you. Bertrand smiled and pulled her close. The problem lurked In the crowd because a powerful wizard, who desired Katherine for many years attended. He saw her and drew a deep breath of want. Katherine saw him and said to Bertrand, That man is a powerful wizard. I have spurned his advances many times. Can we go home? I dont trust him. What can he do? Bertrand asked. You are powerful enough stop him. I am, Katherine said, but we are in public and I want to remain a secret. Even as she said this, the wizard strolled to them and smiled, a smile that would freeze water. Hello Katherine, you look incredible tonight, as usual, said the wizard. Bertrand, is that you? It is so good to see you out again since your wife ran away. I hope you find Katherines company fulfilling. Bertrand sizzled inside. Yes, I find her an incredible presence at my home. She not only is pleasant company but is teaching me the knowledge of a wizard. I have grown in talent and skill since she arrived. The wizards eyes narrowed, We must see how good you are. One day I must drop by and visit. Katherine replied, Thats unnecessary and a waste of your time, but thank you anyway. Frost seemed to appear between the group until Bertrand broke the ice. Come Katherine, we must leave. We have entertained the good people long enough. As if caught eavesdropping, several people scurried away and busied themselves elsewhere. Bertrand smiled at their discomfort. Taking Katherines hand, Bertrand said goodbye to the host and then left. Bertrand smiled as they walked away, Well that was fun! I or we will be the talk of the town tomorrow. And it is only our first outing together. Who would have dreamed of this happening? Katherine never smiled. Bertrand, this is not good, She said. The wizard is evil and up to something. His actions are never good. I need to speak to my coven tonight. It will require my absence overnight. I leave as soon as we are home. Bertrand asked, How bad can it be? Katherine threw some things in a bag and hurried out the door. Bernard barely had time to acknowledge her kiss before she was gone. He watched her until she left his sight. He had no clue to her urgency in leaving. Katherine waited till she left his sight before pulling a wand. She circled the wand several times with a chant. A portal opened and the home of her coven appeared! Katherine summoned the leadership with a call for help. I am in dire need, she said. I was sent to teach Bertrand magic. The lessons went well but we fell in love. Our love became public at a celebration in the town. Entwine, the wizard, attended the party and made comments to us about our relationship. He promised to come to our house to visit. You know that Entwine has pursued a relationship with me for many years. I spurned his advances because he is evil. I fear him using Bertrand as a threat to make me become his lover. I do not know what to do. The senior witch raised her hand for silence. I am saddened that you fell in love with this man. You know a relationship with him would fail. You are three hundred years old. While you preserve your looks, he will not. He ages faster and dies soon. There is no magic that will allow him to age like a true wizard. We know about Entwines desire for you. It plagued you through time. It is unfortunate this happened. Entwine followed you to this town. He has every intention to make you his mate. We must discuss this in private. Go to you sleeping quarters. We will summon you when we have decided. Katherine left the room to go sleep. Arriving in her room, she cried into her pillow. Just because you know something is wrong does not prevent you from doing it. She knew better then to fall for Bertrand. But how does something that is wrong feel so right. At the point of sleep, a loud knock startled her. Opening the door, a senior witch stood with a panic beckoning her to come. Bertrand is in trouble, the senior witch said. Entwine guessed you would come here. He went to the house last night. We can only assume the worst. A group of us are coming with you to see what happened. We need to go. They arrived in the main hall to see a group of powerful witches and a wizard waiting for them. The wizard circled his wand and using spoken commands opened a door into Bertrands study. Well, well. Look who is here, Entwine said. Im afraid you arrived too late. Look at my artwork! I paint well, even if I do say so myself. On the wall hung a gorgeous painting that included Bertrand. Bertrand looked so realistic. Suddenly it dawned on them Bertrand looked realistic because he was frozen in the painting. Katherine screamed for Bertrand, What have you done to him? I preserved him for you, Katherine, Entwine said. Three times a year, he will be freed from the painting for 24 hours. He stops aging this way. You can be with him those three days. The rest of the time you stay with me. Katherine pulled her wand, Never. Entwine pulled his wand and shot a spell at Katherine. The entire group that came with her shot back. Entwine buckled under the onslaught of magic. As they prepared to finish Entwine, he yelled, Go ahead and kill me. That way he stays in the painting forever. I alone know the counter spell to free him.  Katherine asked, Where is the staff? What have you done with them? They are with him in the dimension he is in. Why would I send him away alone? Entwine said. The wizard who accompanied the witches stepped forward casting a spell, freezing Entwine in place. We should have done this many years ago. This day you are cast to outer darkness forever. Join me, witches, casting the spell that sends Entwine away. The witches formed a circle, raising their wands in the air while chanting a spell. Light circling Entwine moving faster and faster. Entwine screamed threats and in pain as the portal opened pulling him inside. The portal slammed shut sealing Entwine in outer darkness forever. Silence filled the room. Katherine spoke, Couldnt we wait till we freed Bertrand? Now he is in the painting forever. The wizard spoke, I know the spell. Only an act of unexpected act of love can free Bertrand. It must come from a stranger yet known by Bertrand. Katherine walked to the painting and rubber the canvass. She stepped back because her hand penetrated the canvass. The wizard spoke, Apparently Entwine intended for you to join Bertrand. The spell to send you to him is still active. If you enter the painting, you too must wait for that love of a stranger. Katherine pulled a chair next to the painting. She wiped a tear from her eye. Stepping onto the chair, she looked back before stepping into the painting. As she stepped into the painting, the scene shifted on the canvass as Bertrand now had Katherine in his arms. The witches and wizard closed the house. They set protections preventing vandalism. Dawn on Easter Sunday rolled around, and the painting shimmered. Bertrand and Katherine along with the staff stepped out of the painting. They celebrated 24 hours of freedom. Bertrand held Katherine in his arms. He said, You didnt need to enter the painting. You should have gone home. Katherine replied, I did go home. Home is with you. At dawn the next day, the painting shimmered pulling everyone back to the painting. Bertrand and Katherine decided they would change the scene each time they returned to the painting. After many years passed, Bertrands great grandson visited the house. He spoke to his father about his love of the house. His great grandfather owned the house. Talking to his grandfather, he asked about living in the house. The grandfather lived in the house briefly. His mother, Bertrands ex-wife left with him in the dead of night when the grandfather was a child. They returned after Bertrand disappeared. The grandfather gave the blessing to the grandson to live in the house. One day after living there several years, the grandsons wife came and stood beside him. Why do you stand here looking at this painting so much? Two reasons. First that is my great-grandfather, the original owner, in the painting. I was told about this property many years ago. I asked my dad if I could have the house. It has been vacant for so long. It came to my grandfather because Bertrand disappeared. My grandfather became owner after they found my great-grandmother. With his permission, we moved here. The second reason is the painting seems to change scenes several times a year. Have you noticed? His wife answered, Im so glad you said that. I thought I was losing my mind. Several months later, the wife came screaming to her husband, Come quick! The painting is bursting with light! They both ran to the painting just in time to see everyone emerge from the canvass. The man and his wife stood there too scared to speak. Bertrand also stood in silence. Finally, he spoke, We try to exit the painting when you are gone. We thought you were out of town. My apologies for scaring you so. HowwhatHow long have you been doing this? The husband asked. Why are you doing this? Bertrand answered, You need to sit down. For the next several hours, Bertrand and Katherine explained everything. The staff went to the kitchen to prepare food. When Bertrand finished, they sat in silence for a time. So, for three to four times a year, you can leave the painting for 24 hours, the husband asked. Thats correct, Katherine replied. We have been doing this for so long, unable to break the curse, we have come to like it. Most of the staffs family is gone. I do not know what is happening with my coven of witches. We do not age this way. That must be why the house is in such good shape, the wife asked. Yes, Bertrand answered. The wizard who put us in the painting preserved the house so we would suffer forever. It turns out we enjoy this. The husband said he was prepared to break the spell, but Bertrand declined. So, this fairy tale doesnt have a happy ending where everyone is saved, the husband asked. No, Bertrand replied. Just consider us relatives who drop in from time to time. The staff has prepared food. We are starving. Can we go to the dining room and eat? I have a lot to tell you about the past."
Lying Anna,"Anna, one of these days all these lies will get you in a lot of trouble, warned Mom for the hundredth time.But did Anna listen? No. Eight-year old Anna just shook her head full of dark curls defiantly and went on telling lies. She told lies when she did not have to. She told lies even when telling the truth would be a lot easier.Anna is that my magic eraser you are using? asked Samantha, her best friend. Did you take it from my pencil case without asking?No, its not yours. replied Anna, as she continued erasing. Its mine.No its not. My name is written on it, responded Samantha angrily.Samantha knew that Anna was lying and that made her very mad. She did not want to be Annas friend anymore. Actually, everyone was tired of Annas lies. Her classmates complained to the teacher and the teacher complained to her mother and her mother complained to her father but no one knew what to do about it.Till one day when everything came to a head. Anna was playing with her Frisbee in her back yard. She threw the Frisbee so hard that it went flying over the fence onto the dirt path which ran behind the house. She opened the small garden gate and went to retrieve the disc. She had never gone out this way before and she found herself in a field of wild mushrooms that had sprouted all over. Anna soon realized that these were no ordinary mushrooms. They were all in different colors and had different patterns. Some had red tops with white polka dots, others had blue top with purple stripes; there were yellow ones with orange diamonds and black ones with silver stars.Annas eyes lit up in fascination and she reached down and touched the black one. Ah, it felt as soft as velvet. Then, to her amazement, the silver stars started to twinkle and the mushroom started to grow big and was soon bigger than her. Soon all the mushrooms started to grow. Anna could not tell if the mushrooms were growing bigger or if she was growing smaller but everything looked gigantic to her. She realized that they werent actually mushrooms, they were houses with windows and doors and smoking chimneys.She wondered who would live in a place like this? And then she saw him, a pixie wearing a red sweater and green leggings, riding a bicycle, which had a basket, attached to the front handle. He was pushing down on the pedals fast. He seemed to be in a hurry to get somewhere. he rang the bell. The astounded Anna could not move out of the way fast enough, so the pixie, trying to avoid her, collided with the tree. All the stuff fell out of his basket, the freshly baked bread, the marmalade and a very delicious looking cupcake.Ouch, he screamed in pain, rubbing his bruised knees. Why did you not move out the way human girl, did you not hear me ring the bell?No, I did not, lied Anna, though she had heard it loud and clear. Here I can help you with your stuff.While the pixie was busy rubbing his bruised knees and hollering in pain, Anna picked up the bread and the marmalade. And then she saw the cupcake, it simply looked delicious and her mouth started to salivate. She just had to take a bite. So she took a teeny bite, hoping it would not be noticed.It tasted of fresh strawberries that had been covered in chocolate and fresh cream, and it melted in her mouth. She had never eaten anything as delicious before. She took another bite and then another. Before she knew it, she had eaten the entire cupcake. What was she going to do now? She hoped the pixie would not notice!Here pixie, Ive picked up all your stuff, said Anna.Where is the cupcake I baked for the wizards birthday? replied the pixie knitting his brows as he looked around.I did not see any cupcake, lied Anna. Maybe you left it at home.I did not leave it at home! What is that around your mouth? asked the pixie stomping his foot angrily. Is that icing? Are those strawberries stain? Did you eat the cupcake?No, I did not, said Anna as she hastily wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.You are lying, and I refuse to take blame for the missing cupcake.You will come along with me and you will confess to the wizard about eating his cupcake, said the pixie as he grabbed Anna by her arm.Anna tried to fight him off but realized that she was too small and that her hands and feet had pins and needles so she was not able to get away from him. The pixie picked her up and put her in the basket of his bicycle and then rode straight into the midst of the mushroom houses. They rode for what seemed like hours but in reality it was only a few minutes. By now Anna was starting to feel very frightened and she started to sob, she missed her mother and her father and also her best friend Samantha a lot. She wondered if they were all missing her too and were looking for her.The pixie rode down a winding dirt path till he reached a forbidding castle with a moat around it. Tring, tring he rang his bell and the drawbridge came down. He rode through the bridge and Anna could see that some elves and fairies and foxes and hares were preparing for a feast.Whats happening? asked Anna always so curious.Its the wizards birthday and we are throwing him a party, replied the pixie as he parked his bicycle against the castle wall.Anna forgot all about the cupcake and felt excited for she loved parties. They walked to where everyone was collected. There was a table set with sandwiches and chips, donuts covered with sprinkles and rainbow flavored cotton candy, there was fruit punch and lemonade. Anna could not wait to eat all the good stuff.On another table was a heap of presents wrapped in colorful wrapping paper. There were balloons and streamers floating in the air and music was playing. Everyone was having a wonderful time.Then came the wizard looking so handsome, dressed in a shiny black suit, his pointy black hat had the golden sun and silver moon shining through it. Everyone cheered and sang. Soon it was time to cut the cake. But there was no cake.Hey where is my cake? asked the wizard petulantly. Pixie did you not bake me your special cupcake?The pixie looked crestfallen, he pointed to Anna and said She ate the cupcake.Everyone looked horrified! She ate the wizards cupcake!!No, I did not! exclaimed Anna shaking her head. It fell in the dirt.Right after she uttered the lie, the wizard looked straight into her eyes and his deep black eyes flashed green, he muttered something under his breath. Everyone stood still, they were all petrified of the wizards temper and his spells, but to their delight he kept his temper in check. After all it was his birthday.Since no birthday party can be complete without a cake, the wizard pulled out his magic wand and created a huge cupcake that everyone got to share, even Anna who really should not have.Tfos ih sl dulicesh, exclaimed Anna, but wait what was happening?Annas words were making no sense. They sounded gibberish and no one in Mushroom Land understood gibberish, every time Anna spoke everyone just shook their head and walked away.At first she was perplexed at what was happening but then she got really scared. What if she could never talk normaly again!Hkln md! she begged the pixie who had brought her on the bicycle.But he could not understand her. Poor Anna maybe she should not have told all those lies! The thought of her mother and her father and Samantha never understanding her words made her very sad and she started to cry. The more she cried the more it put a damper on the rejoicing.Who is ruining my party? asked the wizard in his loud booming voice.I ag sh skotry, wept Anna. I pgumfxe whgf nwcdt lje ahson.Now the wizard knew gibberish as he often spoke it himself especially when he muttered his curses and spells so he understood what she just said.I can see that you are truly sorry for all the lies youve told, and since it is my birthday and I am in a terrific mood, I am willing to remove the spell, he said. But there is a condition.Anna was desperate to agree to anything, she only wanted to be able to speak normally again.If you ever lie again your words will turn to gibberish and nothing will be able to break that spell.I promise I will never tell another lie, said Anna crying and then laughing to hear normal words coming from her tongue.The grand birthday party was coming to an end and the pixie offered to give Anna a ride on his way back home.Since that strange day much to her mother and her father and everybody elses surprise Anna has not told another lie. And if I were her I would not either!"
The Safe Place,"Every inch of his body was hurt. Herin had to catch his breath every five minutes just to stay concious. He could still hear the echoes of the hunter chasing behind him, their tauntings still fresh in his mind. In front of him, all he could see with his bleeding eyes was the darkness of the forest. With his blood pouring from his chest, the shadow wouldnt be able to help him. They could smell his blood.  Herin had nowhere to hide and no place to run.  , his ghoulish brain supplied helpfully. . At least, he made it past eighteen. It was six years years longer than his father had expected him. His mother would be disappointed, but- He slumped againts a tree.  Mom, he said out loud, then a few seconds later he chuckled to himself. His stupid brain had officially lost it. His mother was dead. She couldnt answer his plea. Nobody could. I want to live. Just as he was starting to lose the senses of his body, something bright catched his eyes. Without meaning to, his hand reached out. Then, he let himself fall. *** When Herin opened his eyes again, he couldnt see the green of the trees. He couldnt smell them either. It spurned him awake. Taking in his surrounding, Herin crouched in defensive position. There was a male human within his proximity, armless and defenseless. Whoa, calm down, buddy, the human said, his hands up as if he was warding off a wild animal. Herin bared his teeth. If he didnt get out of here soon, he would be more dangerous than a wild animal. Where am I? He realized, in his panic state, that he was half-naked and almost fully-bandaged. It meant two things at once. First, this man had saved him. Second, this man had saved him despite  what he was.  The man watched him drawing the conclusion. When Herin didnt attempt to move, he sighed and confirmed his guess, Youre in a safe place. The human didnt smell like a liar. Herin sat down. Without his adrenaline, he didnt have the energy to stand up. . His mother had talked about it. The humans called it Lessiah but among his kinds, they had called it a safe place. Creatures like him only gave name to things that mattered. This place, however secure and valuable it was, didnt. Once, Herin had asked if his mother ever had the pleasure to come here. To humanly creatures who was constantly hunted and hiding, a safe place sounded like paradise. She had gripped his hands tightly, and warned him to come only when nothing else worked. Herin had taken in the naked apprehension in her eyes and nodded mutely. Your wound opened again, the man said. Leili will be pissed off. Thank you for your hospitality, Herin said stiffly. As soon as I repay you, I wont bother you again, and then we can pretend I am never here. The man stared at him. Just stay here. He left Herin alone with his thoughts.The human either memorized Ghouls strict code of honour or trusted Herin, a complete stranger, to do as he said. It irked him off. This wouldnt be the first time he got help from humans but they usually wasnt aware that he wasnt one of them.  The man came back with a medical kit and a female human. Herin unconciously stiffened and forced himself to relax before they noticed his nervousness. Judging from their stares, they didnt miss it at all. Great, the last thing he needed was to be in the mercy of smart observant humans.  You said youre willing to repay us? the man asked, as the female human slowly approached his bed. Yes, Herin said, even though it killed him to admit it. Ghoul never left debts unpaid. It was instilled in their very nature. The female human smiled. Herin immediately didnt like him. His gut feeling was proven true when she opened her mouth, Stay with us. He hung his mouth open. What? Stay with us until your wounds healed. I am... Herin hesitated. Are you sure? The humans could literally ask him to do  and he would gladly obey. The man nodded, his face casual as if he didnt just make a deal with a literal monster. The names Kami. Shes Leili. Whats yours?  Ghoul didnt usually give out their names. Herin gave it easily. The humans seemed pleased. Just a little, he could see why his mother didn't want to be here. *** The people in the safe place liked him immediately. The feelings werent mutual but they didnt seem to care. They liked him even if he did his best to be distant. For some reasons, they trusted him with their kids, their savety, their .  Herin couldnt comprehend it. You make this face when we act kind toward you, said the granny next door. Despite his effort, Herin knew her name. Kind of hard not to when she always brought cookies and feed him delicious food everytime she visited. Like were the weird one. You  weird. Sweetheart, I am the human in this room. It was the first time any of them admitted that they knew what he was. Herin tried to be scared but with the smell of baked muffins filling in the room and granny smiling down warmly at him, he found himself couldnt. Somewhere between being saved three weeks ago and interacting with the rest of the villagers, he had lost his edge.  It wasnt just that, either. Hed learned that Leili wasnt a morning person and Kami liked to stay up all night. Robert who lived two houses away liked to gossip and showered Herin with hugs. Gerald didnt like crowds but he didnt want to be alone either. Rippey was six-months and expecting a boy. The Findlier family who owned the biggest farm in the village was very generous and had once given Herin two baskets of apple. Herin could recount in details every habits of all the people in Lessiah. None of them ever treated him like he was a monster to be feared. Dont think too hard about it, the granny said, as if reading his mind. I dont get it, he admitted. I am just an outsider. Both figuratively and literally. Herin wasnt even a human. Granny shook her head. She looked sad. Herin didnt want her to be sad. I am sorry. Dont be, sweetheart. You guys arent letting me leave, are you? Kami walked in, snorting. Herin didnt notice his presence at all. Three weeks ago, he would have a breakdown over this fact. You finally notice? said Kami, grabbing one of the cake granny brought in. Sorry, kid, but Leili had a strict code on her own. She couldnt let a kid like you wander alone. Herin smiled bitterly. Even if that kid is a Ghoul? Between you and me, I think Ghoul is better than human. His eyes darkened then. Not for the first time, Herin wondered what he'd seen in the past. Besides, you want to live, dont you? I heard you. He sat down in front of Herin, staring at him with intensity. I wont let you die alone. Herin should have seen this three weeks ago. This was what his mother was scared of. . This was exactly what happened when you started giving names to things that didnt suppose to matter."
The Man who Lost his Face to Find his Place,"Long ago, back when the trees were still learning how to grow, a man learned made a decision that caused him nothing but woe. For he was a lonely soul, living with his brother in a dreary hole. He never knew the kiss of a woman or the gentleness of a friendly hand.Half-man half-troll is what they called him, and no matter how short he trimmed his claws, his appearance made the townsfolk grim. His pimply face and left leg longer than his right, caused his hobbling to be a hideous sight, and it didnt help that the lack of light deep in the woods turned his skin a pale white.The man wished to have someone other than his brother, and one day, he came across another. Atop a spiraling tree, a raven shouted down to him welcomingly, Dear creature, would you be so kind as to come up here.Ive never met a bird that talks, or one that strays so far from its flock. The man replied, and the crow sighed.You would be correct good, hideous thing, but alas I have jammed my wing. Might you be able to free me, and perhaps, I could reward you justly?Perhaps you could stop calling me thing. The man ascended up the tree and wrenched the bird free. If I wanted to hear that, Id listen to the townsfolk sing.So, youre the famous monster. To be honest, I expected a much bigger disaster.I didnt choose to look this way. If only I was like them, I could change what they say. The man muttered, and the ravens feathers fluttered.Is that what you truly wish? A gleam entered the ravens eye, and for a moment, the world around them seemed to die. Well, as luck would have it, I ate a fortune fish as my morning dish.I dont understand.Just tell me your demand, and Ill be sure it lands in the palm of your hand. That is the gift I received when I ate the fish, the ability to grant your every wish.In return for saving you? This sounded too good to be true.You saved my life, so let me grant you land, friends, servants, gold, or a wife.I want to look beautiful. That is the demand from within my soul.Very well, but I am no judge of beauty. May I suggest a different way to fulfill my duty? Instead of wishing for me to change you, what if I grant you the ability to shift yourself until you feel true?So, I can change how I appear? It was almost to good to hear. In that case, your wish is now yours. You can change anything from your face to your pores, exclaimed the raven, and suddenly, it was as if the man had entered a haven. His body shook with excitement, and immediately, his nostrils became filled with an exquisite scent.Bidding the raven goodbye, the man left to give his new powers a try. On the outskirts of the town, he stopped to look around. The people had tan skin, so darkening his was his first step to entering. He then evened out his legs until they were as straight as pegs. Finally, he removed any unattractive features and pimples that made him blend in with storybook creatures.Beauty belonged to him, and now, he could change it at a whim. Walking forward, no one spoke a word. He was just like the townsfolk, but three days later, he began to sulk. He blended in with them, but no one was speaking to him. Instead, everyone was turned to the man with the iron chin and irresistible grin. His immaculate face was filled with grace, and soon, the man wanted his place.Changing again, the man sculpted his face to be prettier than the other men, and woman from all around flocked to see him in his prime. This lasted for a week, but one day, he overheard a cluster of people call him meek. He may have the looks to charm anyone, but he couldnt stop an orc or slay a dragon. In another month, a war far off concluded, and the man soon found himself excluded. Soldiers returned home with square jaws and muscles raw, and it soon became clear, their opinion was the law. The soldiers were admired by all, and the man realized he no longer wished to be viewed as small.Changing to a third form, the man added a set of muscles that were the perfect storm. Joining the soldiers, he became the strongest of them all, and without assistance, he surrounded the town with a massive, stone wall. The towns folk praise him for protecting them, but a new threat arrived in the form of a gem.Strolling into town, a noble flooded the market with gold and jewels prettier than the fairest maiden, and all soon forgot about the man. The man flexed his muscles and chiseled jaw, but compared to the diamonds, his popularity was beginning to thaw. Oh, how he wished to be rich and possess the lavish, but then an idea sprung into his mind about how he could once again use his wish.Fourth times the charm, and this time, he gave himself a diamond arm. Just by clipping his fingernails, hed produce enough coin to fill one hundred pails. Servants, fine wine, and exquisite food lay at his feet, but as he dined with the elite, another figure appeared for the townsfolk to greet. A traveler with tales from far and wide. Ancient curses, hidden kingdoms, forgotten prophesies: hed even picked up a princess as his bride. None could match his experience, and his tales wowed his audience. Soon, the man was once again on the outside, and he could do little as his status died.One last time, he decided, and once again he made a decision that was misguided. Giving himself wings to soar far and hooves to trek through the darkest woods, he thought this time he was finally good. However, before he could win the townsfolk attention and praise, he needed an adventure that would capture their gaze. So, he set off into the forest where he once came from, and finally, someone saw what he had become.Hands up creature. What brings you here? It was the brother who he once lived alongside, but with his new form, his brother didnt recognize him no matter how hard he tried.Brother, its me. I can look like this because I rescued a bird from a tree.If thats true, can you change back to you?	Of course. The man began to revert to when things were worse. First, he added pimples, then he removed the diamonds and stretched his left leg, but something felt wrong. No, it wasnt his left leg that was too long. It was his right leg or was it too strong. Also, was it pimples or warts, or was his leg actually too short.	He rushed over to a lake and gazed at the face that felt fake. He knew he altered his chin, but what was it back in the beginning? He used to be ugly so maybe add missing teeth, but even as he ripped them out, he couldnt change what he felt underneath.	Some say that, to this day, hes still standing above the lake, ever awake and trying to fix his mistake. After years of changing to become others, he lost the person he was to both him and his brother. Such is the fate of those who take anothers path to haven, and I should know, after all I am the raven."
"The Pregnant Woman, the Spineless Man, and the Witch","A long, long time ago, on the same street, in the same town, there lived a pregnant woman, a spineless man, and a witch. The spineless man was the father of the pregnant woman's baby. The witch was in love with the spineless man, and the spineless man was in love with the pregnant woman. The pregnant woman lived alone and loved no one. The witch, madly besotted with the man that was unaware of her acidic passion, went to the pregnant woman. She threatened her; she shrieked curses; she shouted spells that left burnt patches on the walls and knocked over bookshelves. The pregnant woman waited, patiently, and when there was a lull in the witch's insanity, she simply said, The witch cackled madly and exploded a hole in the wall. Hiking up her skirts, she stepped through it, crowing over her shoulder as she did a final insult: When the witch was gone, the pregnant woman replaced the spilled books upon the shelves and shifted the furniture to cover the singed spots in the butter-yellow wallpaper. The hole in the wall was quickly filled in by a group of village boys, all vying for the pregnant woman's attention. She gave nothing to them but vague smiles and a handful of nickels, and they left, complaints drifting after them in a cloud of surliness.The witch, meanwhile, went to the spineless man's house and told him of her visit. The man (being spineless) feigned joy, but the witch saw through it, and pressed him. Immediately, he admitted to being in love with the woman the witch so despised; furiously, the witch transformed him to a newt on the spot.While it was satisfying seeing him wriggling helplessly across the liquor-stained rug, the witch's rage still collected in her lids and slipped down her chin; ruthlessly, the witch ground the newt beneath her heel and set off for the woman's house, intending to do much, much worse.Scornfully, she shoved through the newly-patched hole and forced the pregnant woman to her feet. The woman's face reflected only polite surprise. the pregnant woman inquired. Scoring her nails down the indifferent face she so despised, the witch shook with fury. Curses dribbled like wine down her chin; she punctuated every oath with a blow. Blood dripped from the furrows the witch had left along the pregnant woman's perfectly angled chin. Still, the woman made no sound, and her face displayed no reaction.The witch paused, heaving for breath, and the pregnant woman ventured: the witch stammered, frantically shaking her by the shoulders. the pregnant woman agreed, her head flopping around like a ragdoll's. the witch shrieked, pointing at her with a shaking finger. They remained, for several long, tense seconds- the witch's chest heaving, her bony finger inches from the woman's nose, and the pregnant woman looking at the witch without any trace of fear or grief in her eyes.Then, suddenly, the pregnant woman laughed. It was a tinkling chuckle, a mocking one, a derisive laugh intended only for formal dinner parties and late-night balls.The witch's eyes widened, and she breathed faster and faster, heavier and heavier. the woman said pityingly, daintily wiping a tear of mirth from her eye. From out of the witch's throat came a disbelieving croak, much like one a frog would make. the pregnant woman said, placing a cool palm on the witch's cheek. The hand on the witch's cheek scalded, like it was a red-hot poker, but the witch was rooted in place. Her mouth continued to move, flapping up and down, but nothing came out.The woman surveyed the witch in a sympathetic matter. she murmured. It was impossible not to notice that the pregnant woman's bloody furrows were gone, and that her skin was once again perfect and healthy and unmarked.The witch's skin seemed to be rippling, slightly. the witch croaked. the pregnant woman said calmly- or, was she still pregnant? Her protruding stomach was gone, replaced by rippling folds of clothing, and she was glowing.The witch's skin rippled and melted and shrank. the witch gasped. The woman- the woman with the angel's wings, and the magisterial eyes, and the glowing skin- crouched down, until she was nose-to-nose with the ever-shrinking witch. the woman said softly. The witch's bodily surface was a roiling mess of organs and blood and suffering and inaudible shrieks. The witch was a puddle of her former self, and the not-quite-angel surveyed her, and the not-quite-angel laughed."
Bad Shadow-Good Shadow,"I was six years old when I first learned about the shadows.     Holidays were always spent a Grandpa and Grandma Wilkinson's house in the country.  A big old house that was built by grandpa's father and added on to by grandpa.     At first there was no indoor plumbing but grandpa took care of that on orders from grandma.  A laundry room and two bathrooms, one full size by grandma's bedroom and one smaller off the kitchen where the woodshed had been.     Trees surrounded the house and barn.  Elsewhere around the house were various bushes and flower beds grandma had planted.  And as a proud American grandpa had a flagpole in the middle of the front yard within the circle drive.     From the road the driveway wound through the woods to the house.  Anybody passing would not even know it was there.  All who visited enjoyed the quiet and solitude.     This was going to be my first holiday not sleeping in the guest room with mother and father.  I would have the pullout couch in the family room.  And because everyone enjoyed watching television I would get to stay up late with the adults.     Grandma and mom had vixed supper for us but kept it rather light since in two days Thanksgiving dinner would be quite a spread.  To me it seemed to take forever for everyone to eat so we could gather for an evening of tv.     Jeopardy and Price Is Right had our attention the first hour of the evening.  Two comedy shows followed.  Then before the eleven o'clock news came a crime drama that triggered my awareness of shadows.     It was a show about a murder.  Seems a man killed his wife and plastered her body behind a wall in the hallway.  It seemed he had gotten away with it until a day or two later the housekeeper noticed what appeared to be a wet spot on the wall.  She thought a water pipe had broken so she called a plumber.  The plumber thoughtnit blood rather than water so they called the police.  The police came, broke into the wall and found the woman's body.  They arrested the man at his office.     That night after everyone had left for the kitchen, mom got my couch ready and tucked me in for the night.  She wished me goodnight as she closed the door so the adults chatter would not keep me awake.     After a while, the night light threw a dark shadow on the wall right where a piece of wallpaper had begun to peel away.  But to me that night it looked like blood soaking through the wall.     I rolled over and tried to get to sleep.  But all I could think of was that blood soaking through the wall.     It would be easy to tell mom I was scared to sleep alone.  But then they would think I was still too little to stay up late with them.  So I decided to keep quiet but that shadow kept bugging me.  Somehow I did eventually fall asleep.     The next day it seemed like everywhere I went there were shadows.  And with a bright November sun one shadow kept following me around when I was outside playing.     As the sun began to set on the evening before Thanksgiving it shone brightly through the porch window.One of grandma's taller bushes cast a dancing shadow onto the floor.  It was kind of fun to watch and dance with it as the wind blew it around.  Yet it still made me think of that creepy shadow on the wall.     That night while the ladies prepared dishes for our Thanksgiving feast, us men went to the front room to watch some variety show specials.  Grandpa had built a big fire in the fireplace that sent more dancing shadows onto the floor.  I kept looking around at the walls for that bloody shadow.     Going through grandma's bedroom to use the big bathroom I found a really tall shadow.  On the window ledge she had a small plant that with the last of the evening sun shining through cast a shadow that looked like a bushy haired stick figure laying on the floor.  That one was kind of funny.     Thanksgiving morning grandma sent me to the basement to get a jar of her watermelon pickles.  The one light at the bottom of the stairs sent dark shadows in every direction.  They were pretty creepy but not like the wall looking like blood.     As everyone gathered for breakfast I noticed grandpa had a shadow that looked like Gandoff.  Grandma's shadow looked like a withered, bent over witch (no offense Grandma).  When mom accidently turned off the light all the shadows went away.     I had to remember that.  If I had mom turn off that night light when I went to bed, maybe that creepy bloody shadow would not keep me awake.     Not long after we finished breakfast, Aunt Mary and Uncle John arrived with my cousins Donny and Deanna.  I told them about all the shadows.     Donny was the oldest and came up with the idea of making our own shadows.  He found a small lamp and we took it to the guest room.     It turned into a lot of fun.  If we put the light on the chest of drawers the shadows appeared on the floor long and lean.  If we put the light on the floor the shadows appeared toll and lanky.  Deanna could make shadows with her hand and fingers that looked like animals.     However, after almost two hours of finding various objects and seeing what kind of shadow they made, Donny and Deanna seemed to get bored.  They wanted to do something else.As we looked for something else to do Donny proceeded to tell me that everyone and everything had shadows except vampires.  He said they could stand in front of a mirror and there would be nothing showing in the mirror.  So of course the next thing we had to do was stand in front of a mirror to be sure we were not vampires.     So with all of our shadow play I learned that even though some shadows were creepy looking they were just shadows.  And whether  it was sunlight or room light there were shadows.  Moonlight had its shadows and those tended to the the more creepy ones.     Guess now I would be looking at people to see what kind of shadow they cast.  And if I ran across someone who did not have a shadow?  That would be another story."
The Happy Little Boy,"Once upon a time in a little country somewhere far away there was a forest, in the forest there was a river and by the river there was a village. The village was full of small, thatched houses and happy villagers. Well, mostly happy villagers because you see there was one house just on the edge of the village: all by itself, all alone. This sad little house belonged to a sad little boy; he didnt have a name because none of the villagers cared enough to give him one. They all avoided him like he was sick with a terrible disease. They wouldnt walk past him on the roads, they wouldnt serve him in the shops. The other children would never play with him, even the pets about the village steered away from him. He had to go into the forest to forage for food at night because no-one would let him anywhere near their own food or animals. He truly was a lonely little boy.  At nighttime if anyone had bothered to venture to the sad little house owned by the sad little boy they would hear him, talking softly to nothing, whispering to the air and eventually they would hear the sound of the lonely little boy crying himself to sleep, but no-ever did because no-one ever went near. Now, you might be wondering to yourself why are they so cruel to the lonely little boy? What has he done to deserve that? the villagers are all so very horrid!, well let me tell you; There is actually a very good reason why the villagers treat him like they do, there is a very reasonable explanation why the lonely little boy lives his lonely little life in his sad little house on the very edge of the happy little village and the reason is this: The lonely little boy lives his lonely little life because he is an evil little shit, None of the villagers would ever say that he was raised the wrong way, he wasnt mixed in bad company, his parents adored him but kept him well, he wasnt poor but he wasnt spoilt, he is just a disgusting, depraved, evil little fuck.  When the lonely little boy was only eight years old his loving daddy had a terrible fall in the forest one day as he gathered wood for the fire, instead of running for help the lonely little boy watched his father as he writhed in pain, a compound fracture tearing through his skin and severing an artery. The lonely little boy just watched and counted how long it took for his father to exsanguinate and then, when he was certain that daddy breathed no more, he skipped his way back to his family house and sat down to dinner. As you could probably imagine the villagers were distraught when the lonely little boys father had failed to return, they gathered together to search for him while the lonely little boy sat at home with his mother awaiting the news he already knew. It took a long time for the villagers to find the body, because the lonely little boy had hidden the corpse under a log, just for fun. He and his mother sat there as the minutes passed more slowly than a snails pace and eventually the lonely little boy had another fine idea, he offered to make his crying mother a nice hot cup of acorn tea to help stop her from crying, because of course he didnt want his mummy to cry. He went to the river and drew the water to boil, they had plenty of roasted acorns to make the tea at home but the lonely little boy had another ingredient in mind. Down by the river there grew many different plants and everyone in the village knew which ones were safe and which were not, they knew that the watercress was a delicious treat but the bright red berries never should they eat. The berries came from a special plant that grew only on that river and they had no taste and no smell but only a single berry was fatal to even the strongest of men and so it was that the lonely little boy took a handful of the brightly coloured fruits, carefully using a leather pouch as a glove so as not to touch them and squeezed them hard so that the lethal juice mixed with the clean, fresh water for his mothers acorn tea. It was a little less than two hours later that the lonely little boy watched his mother choke away her final breaths with a warm little smile on his lonely little face.  It didnt take long for the word to get around about what had happened; of course, it was a shock that she should take her own life before hearing the news of her husband but sometimes grief can be very unpredictable they all said and decided that it was best left alone, after all there was the newly orphaned child to consider now. And so, they took it upon themselves to care for the lonely little boy, to help him through his hardship. The villagers realised that although theyd known the mother and the father, theyd never known the lonely little boy, not even his name. The lovely townsfolk cooked his meals and washed his clothes, they gave him toys and treats, anything to put a smile on his unhappy little face. But all too soon the kindness stopped, not a word of thanks had come from the lips of the lonely little scrounger, not so much as a Hello, good day not one word at all so all the villagers, frustrated in their efforts decided to leave him to himself; if he didnt want to talk to anyone then thered be no-one to talk to him. And so, the lonely little wastrel looked on coldly as the happy villagers went on with their happy lives all around, never again giving a thought to the lonely little house on the edge of the happy little village.  As the seasons passed by the lonely little house became cold and broken, but no-one would help, they didnt mend the walls or thatch the roof, because why should they? And so, the lonely little boy shivered in his lonely little house as he tried to light a lonely little fire to warm his frozen little hands. He tried for an hour before the first embers glowed, but glow they did and as the embers grew from sparks to flames the comforting warmth spread across the lonely little face and the lonely little boy knew at last a familiar kind of kindness; the warm glow of the winter fire. As the fire grew to a comfortable flame the lonely little boy looked out of the window of his lonely little house at the happy little houses in the happy little village and with a happy little smile he knew how to share his kindness with the rest of the happy little village. The lonely little boy set to work, darting to and fro from the forest to the village, gathering the fallen leaves and dry twigs, back and forth from house to house piling the tinder first and then the kindling.   It was the darkest dead of a moonless night by the time the lonely little boy had finished his work and with a nod of satisfaction he returned to his house for this one last time and took a burning branch lit from his own little fire. He carefully placed the makeshift torch to the base of each pile of each house in the happy little village and then, as the flames spread across the bone-dry thatch and up the wooden walls he sat in the centre and watched, the warm glow of the fires warming him and reminding him of those few happy times hed shared with his family, when his father was home and sober and his dear mama was not out at her work. He remembered so fondly the tiny little sliver of peace before mummy and daddy would scream and shout and fight. The flames spread so very quickly in the gentle chilly breeze, and now there were screams to punctuate the jolly crackling fire, each house so fully ablaze and not a single exit for any of them. The happy little boy smiled again as he remembered the time the villagers came and helped him after hed helped his mummy and daddy who were never very happy at all he thought. He didnt know why the villagers helped him but he was grateful, even when they were unhappy too and he didnt know why they became so mean to him. But that was all fine now, they were all happy and laughing in the warm winter fire and they could all live happily ever after."
