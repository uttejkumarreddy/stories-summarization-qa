Bedroom Window,"They say eyes are the windows to your soul.I couldn't sleep. Which was nothing new.I tossed off my comforter,sank my cold feet into my fuzzy slippersand made my way to my window.The glass feels icy cold to the touch.Normally I lean against it.Because I like it so much.I have an amazing view up here where I am.Like my own private window of the world.The buildings are still aglow, there's a thin layer of snow.The sky is clear. Not even a star out tonight.Its unusually quiet this late.I stand there and wait for cars to pass by.I love the humming sound that comes from their speakers.Sometimes, I try and imagine whose inside each vehicle.Just like I pretend to know the names of thepeople down on the street.Amy and Paul who hold hands as they pass.Jill and Steven I saw him go in for a kiss.Rachel and Maggie talking and laughing before their Uber arrives.Wouldn't they be surprised to know I'm awake.I'm just being nosy, up here in my room.I lean my forehead against the hard smooth glass.It feels good on my skin.Where is everyone tonight?No happy couple. No group of friends.I can hear a motor cycle engine but its too far away.He wont pass my window.No not tonight.I been missing you lately. Missing you so much.Which is nothing new.And I wonder where you are.Do I ever cross your mind?Do you stay awake like me?I remember how it use to be.Back then we were happy and I knew you cared.Now I'm painfully alone and I get so scared.Its been much too long since I've seen your face.My heart is shattered without youI know you need your space, I'm fine with that I swear.Just pick up the phone and call.Let me know your ok.Then I wouldn't have to worry every single day.A blue truck rumbles down my street.We use to watch the traffic together.""Try and guess the color of the next car.""You would say to me. Back then it was just something to do,now I'd give anythingto play that with you.I remember us holding hands as we made our way across the street.Playing Frisbee in the park way after dark.Baking a cake for a birthday dinner.You were very good, we had fun and you were only a beginner.We rode bikes to the library and the ice cream store.You sat on a stool at the counter waiting for more.The novelty shop was two doors down.We looked at the beanie babies and the baseball cards.I brought you a Grover mug.You loved it so much. You asked me.""Do the Grover voice"" and I did it well.Oh how I miss those days.When it was just you and me.Now I'm here by myself and its killing me.I know that your different, I honestly don't care.I just need to see you I wish you were aware.A parent always wonders what their children are up to.No amount of time nor space will make me forget you.I feel like a failure.You chose to go away.But you didn't just move out, you left without a trace.And my memories are what I hold on tobecause I can longer see your face.If I could tell you what you mean to me.That your unique not like any other.Your my son and I love you.But there's so much more I would say.How I can still hear your music.Or the sound of your alarm on your phone.The color of your eyes, the style of your hair.Please come back and see me I have to knowyour still out there.If I could change the past I most certainly would.I'd let you know I'm sorry.So sorry I couldn't give you what you needed from me.Or be the kind of Mom you wanted me to be.Children don't come with instructions.They just hand them to you.Each child is different from all the rest.They will push us to the limit until we pass the test.Nobody explains that your going to f**k up,It is a thankless job and there is no pay.But its in fact the most perfect job, if you do it righteveryday.But I should've been stronger.Protected you more.And not let you leave me, just walk out the door.As I stand here in silence, I'm fully aware thattomorrow will come and you still wont be there.I want to hear your voice again.Its been way to long since I have seen your face.You'll never know my pain or how much its grown.There is a gigantic hole in the middle of my heart.The space that belongs to you.Its reserved for you alone.Please dial my number just call my phone.Let me know you still think of me.That you remember the past.It wasn't always hurt and sadness.Sometimes we had a blast.Laughing, watching movies,I would tickle under your armsyou would tickle my feet.We walked and rode our bikesin the hot summer heat.I taught you to throw a baseballand even how to throw a curve, you alreadyknew how to swing a bat.I can still see you as Darth Vaderon Halloween.Or any number of different costumesThat came in between.I look out of my bedroom windowon this cold winter night, I can pictureyou there on my sidewalk and smile to myself.This is all I have left.So I treasure it immensely.I see the top of your headand your thick brown hair.You have just looked up at me.I wave and you wave now too.I'm tired of pretending,I wish this were true.It feels worse than any migraineor physical pain.The thought of living life without youI guess I will slowly go insane.If eyes are the windows to the soul,then what are the windows to the heart?Please someone tell me.Because mine already broke apart."
HEX,"Emily Buggs awoke suddenly around 2 a.m. She wanted the feel of fresh air on her skin because she was drenched in sweat and spittle, and her satin nightie clung to her petite body. Her home, an ancient structure purchased at a 40% discount by her husband two years ago, was a brick structure that was either too hot or too cold.She rose slowly from her king-sized bed, her sheets rumpled, and put on her best pair of flip flops. She opened her window, which faced a small bush behind their fence, and felt compelled to eat. She had formed a bad habit of eating her favourite cereal, HEX, at odd hours for several weeks. She saw the golden brown package in the shopping centre three weeks ago and decided to give it a shot. She was hooked after she tried it. There was nothing special about it. The vanilla flavor was bland, but she adored it. Every meal left her wanting more. She had eaten around 14 boxes of cereal.She took the bowl of cereal into her room and sat by the window to slowly eat it. Brett, her husband, was out of the country on work. She was completely alone. She was on her fifth spoon when she found something out of the ordinary. Her heart stopped because it was so weird. The golden brown cereal particles began to turn a deep red colour. Her hands shook violently, as if she had been electrocuted. When she sensed a presence, she threw the bowl over the window and began to close the curtains.Unfortunately, she was unable to move. Her feet were firmly planted on the wooden board. Although she couldn't see it, she could feel and smell it as it got closer. What was going on with her? She tried to move again, but she was transfixed.When they first moved in, they found some gaps in the walls as well as how damp the house was. The plumbing system was also a disaster. When she would turn on the kitchen sink faucet, the water would be filthy. They tried everything they could to come up with a solution, but nothing helped. Sue, an African-American woman in her forties, tried to tell her secretly, but she didn't believe her, neither did her husband. She mentioned a young maid dying in that home, but Emily laughed and said she didn't believe in ghosts. Sue cautioned her to be alert since no one had stayed there for more than a month. She had laughed at that silly story that Sue shared with her. Her house was a little odd and spooky, but not haunted. She advised Sue to stop watching too much movies and face reality. Ghosts didn't exist. Besides,she and her husband had been there for more than two years which further proved that her neighbours were wrong. She noticed a crack in the glass. When she looked in that direction, she noticed three long claws that resembled skeletons scratching the glass. She couldn't take her gaze away. Slowly, the word HEX became visible. Was she having hallucinations, or was the cereal evil? If she were still alive, her husband would not believe her when she told him the story.When she looked up, she noticed a pair of eyes looking at her. They were a bright red colour, similar to the cereal. She became perplexed. Was the house really haunted, or was it just a spooky brand of cereal? She was curious as to how many people ate this unusual food. It wasn't a well-known brand, as she hadn't seen any advertisements for it on television.She hadn't had an appetite for anything else since she started eating it. Her husband mocked her about eating like a pregnant woman and suggested she buy a pregnancy kit, but she was on the pill and couldn't be pregnant. Is that all there was to it? Was she expecting? Did pregnant women have hallucinations? She wished she could see her husband. She was all alone in this insane home, and no one could rescue her. If only she could reach for her phone and call her husband.She regained her voice at that point. She let out a piercing scream and took off running. She left her room and into her husband's study, but the eyes followed her. They were making fun of her and observing her. She ran from room to room, but the presence surrounded her. She burst into tears. She had never expected to witness such an unusual occurrence in her life. It was the dreaded cereal. She tried her luck and dashed into one of the restrooms, quickly closing the door behind her. She was by herself. She exhaled a massive sigh of relief as she tightened the window shut. She collapsed on the floor, her hands on her head. She was suffering from a dull ache in her brain. Her heart was pounding with fear.After a few moments, the colour of the room shifted. It had tracked her down. She looked out the window and saw cereal flakes falling on her hair. It looked like snow. The intensity grew until they started to penetrate into her body through her skin. They were all over the place. A strong gust of wind swept her out of the toilet through the broken glass.She knew she was going to die at this point. The cursed house, cursed window, and cursed cereal all conspired to kill her. Dave, her loving husband, will be devastated. He'd come home to an empty house, with no idea where his wife was. He was in love with her so much that he wouldn't rest until he found her.He'd wail like a child and call the cops. Emily wished it was just a nightmare or a prank. The wind continued to haul her to an unknown place. She came across Mr Jaxon, an elderly and odd man who lived alone and made a living by mowing lawns. He was standing outside, hands akimbo, staring up at the sky. He'd seen her, hadn't he? Could he assist her? Would he be capable of rescuing her?"
Mystery Man within 8'x5' fixed glass,"Twinkling stars were playing hide and seek, covered by the moving clouds in the night so meek. It was half past one, thoughts of being lonely had just begun. Beside that window she kept herself stand, wondering for the end would be so grand. She waited for an year to meet the man; the man of her dreams, the man of her life, to the world she proudly tell herself to be his wife. That was the night she was waiting for so long, as the day next had to take her to where she actually belong. It seemed the fast moving hand of the clock got tired, it was stopping as if it had been fired. Just like her life which had been a roller coaster, she so wanted it to slow down and no more being an imposter. It was dark inside the room, the sheets purely white seemed lit by only the light of the moon.Stuck in between the tall buildings, from the 6th floor she could only have the view of the dull backside of the adjacent buildings and peeking through the edges was astreet with a rotary. That was the only thing she could look upon through that screen but no one passing by at that time of the hour. Her eyes were fixed over the light falling down from the street lamp over the paved pathway. Tired of watching the emptiness of the street, she decided to dose off with blinds open and the moonlight finding way from the fins of the blind. As time passed by, staring up over to the cieling with eyes wide open making her difficult to sleep. The thoughts of the next day running through her mind were not letting her mind to rest. She started feeling cold. A shiver made her goosebumps so intense. She pushed the bedcover and put her feet down. Not realizing its the temperature of the aircon she can lower down, 'The night is getting cold', she said.The sound of clock ticking was helping her to keep the pace of her feet one by one through the length of the room. Following the moonlight, she went by the side of the window again. The fixed glass window was secured by wooden blinds with openable shutters to the sides. She leaned herself over the fixed glass and started to watch the street as if she was waiting for someone to stop by. Her eyes were getting heavy but were not willing to shut. Her eyes suddenly noticed a drop of water over the glass pane sliding down and there was another then another but slower than the rythm of the moving hand of the clock.A car stopped along the street but the only sound that was getting into her earswas 'tick tock', the sound of the clock.A tall handsome guy wearing a dark coloured shirt sneaks out of the passenger seat holding a box. His strong built was visible from his fitted shirt. Hair so short, neatly dressed as what she could observe from that distance.Her eyes went curious for him as they seemed to be trying to get to know him. He moved his arm and twisted his wrist.Must be looking at his watch, she said to herself and then looked at the clock but could not as it was dark inside. Not bothering to switch on the light and neither her phone, Must be around 2, she again murmured.His head was moving right and left, looking over the both sides of the street.'Is he looking for someone? Who meets someone at midnight..!'The car lights flashed and started to move till they gone out of sight leaving him behind standing alone under the street lamp.As time was passing by, she assumed by the sound of thousands of tick from the clock, the movements of the blue shirted man were becoming monotonous.Slowly she realised the room to grow darker and a shadow started to cover the light from the moon. She looked above. The feathery clouds moving in front of the moon and anxiously covering its light. The drizzle was getting visible in the light of the street lamp. The man was still standing there now motionless looking over the right side of the street.Her eyes got still as she started to feel for the helpless man waiting for no-one knows but him.'You idiot man, why dont you go? she shouted hesitatedly.but he did not move..'God knows what he is upto..' Saying this she moved aside.Despite of her apathy, she was feeling concerned for the man standing there at this hour in the rain.She poured water in a glass and pulled the chair towards the window and glanced towards the street light.Where has he gone? Has he met the one he was waiting for? She curiously started to stare here and there till the extent her eyes could lead her. It started to rain heavily.Where could he possibly go? The weather is so rough outside. Did he call his car back.Oh I missed it...!! She felt disappointed.There was a very dim light coming from under a tree with expanded foliage.She squinted and noticed that the light moved.She forced herself againt the window pane to move herself as closer to look clearly out of it.The light went off and on again and again.'What is that?' She asked herself.The light went on and moved, then went off.This continued for around 9-10 times. She tried to look outside from every angle through the window to have a clearer view.Sleep was like evaded from her eyes. She was more concerned of the outside world activity going on, forgetting that she had to look nice for the next day meeting with her man after almost an year.She suddenly got stunned when she felt a cool breeze touched her face, wondering where it came from when the window is having a fixed glass.She heard someone say ""Why can't you come to me when I am so close to you. I know you are awake.""Taken aback she was.She got terrified and tumbled over her feet held the chair which was there beside her.What was that I just felt and heard?She was all agog.Perplexed she went to the window again and gazed out through the light coming from the street lamp but it was hazy. Her stomach was churning and heart felt heavy as she eagerly tried to have a look around but couldn't even find the shadow of the man standing there. She was disappointed and stood there as if she was waiting for him to return.The telephone rang with a loud noise. She realised it is already 7:30 in the morning as she slept there on the chair looking out of the window.Ma'm, your taxi has arrived. You need assistance with your luggage?, the voice on the other side of the phone asked.'No'. She answered.She got herself ready in 15 min and there she was standing in the lobby.While moving out of the building, she sighed 'Atlast the quarantine is over' and gave a nasty look to the building. She was cheerful to leave behind everything and waiting for the new life waiting ahead.Suddenly she got a shiver down ger spine when saw something which reminded her of the previous night incident.'Stop'. She ordered the chauffeur.The taxi was crossing through the same rotary visible from the room she was inhabited in. She was looking at the street lamp, the pathway and the tree when her eyes got numb. It was the same box, the box covered in a white and red floral printed material. She desperately wanted to jump off the taxi to fetch the box.More than frightened she was, thinking of the voice that whispered in her ears yesterday. She took a deep breadth.""Lets go"", she said.She did not look behind whatever it was, who ever the man was she saw through the 8'x5' window yesterday, the mystery stood still."
Home by Midnight,"Hello everyone! Im new to Reedsy; this is my first time participating in the writing challenge. I hope you enjoy my very short story. :)Maggie looked out the window for the sixth time in half that many minutes. In one hand she clutched a rosary tightly, in the other, a kitchen sponge, cold but still covered in suds from her half-hearted attempt to clean. She glanced at the clock.  Rons curfew was midnight.She clutched the rosary tighter. . Maggie glanced at her husband Lucas, collapsed on the couch where he had prayed the rosary and then read aloud until sleep overcame him. She considered voicing her concern over their teenaged son, but she knew he would tell her to stop worrying and go to bed, then he would follow his own suggestion.. She gave the window a final glance, trying to stare past her troubled expression into the shadowed outdoors, then pulled away. She stumbled with weariness that only a worried mother could exhibit. she prayed To call Ron a baby would be an understatement, especially as he dwarfed her and almost towered over his father. At eighteen and a half years old, he considered himself a full-grown man, with all the privileges and rights that came with it, even though he only accepted a few of the responsibilities that came with being a man.She began to wipe off the counter with a long stroke. . She wiped in the opposite direction, but distracted thoughts interspersed her cleaning. He had gone out with friends before, but this was the first night with a later curfew - 12 a.m. Maggie wondered if Ron knew how much he worried her. He had stopped attending church regularly with them once he learned to drive, and the number of girlfriends he had had in the time since then concerned her. She even occasionally smelled the stench of cigarettes lingering around him after one of his boys nights. What if he decided to disobey his parents, choosing to stay out later and not tell her? Perhaps the theaters food gave him food poisoning and he was lying on a floor in pain right now. What if he was injured? The terrible questions raced through her head, each worse than the last.Maggie threw the sponge into the sink with a solid Glancing through the window pane again, she wandered over to the cranky radio and turned it on. ...yeah Aaron, the traffic here on Elmer Street is pretty heavy due to a drunk-driver accident at the intersection. No fatalities have been reported yet, but its still new enough Maggie gasped and slapped the radio off again. She ran to her phone, hands shaking so hard she couldnt type her passcode correctly. She pressed her fingerprint to the sensor.. Time stood still as her phone rang once. No answer. Please, Maggie whispered, but if she were asking her son or praying to God she didnt know. Both, perhaps. Headlights signaled the entrance of a small car onto the narrow street, and her pulse quickened. But it was just the neighbors. The phone rang twice, thrice, four times. Part way through the fifth, someone answered the phone.The sound of young men laughing echoed in the background as another man spoke into the receiver. I promise we left in enough time to get home before midnight. Maggie sighed in relief at her sons irritated voice. You talking to your ? A boy asked with disbelief.Rons voice moved away from the phone. Yes, and I cant hear her. Shut up. He moved back. Sorry, . I promise I have a real reason this time-Maggie cleared her throat. Its not that. I heard there was an accident.He chuckled, releasing pent-up stress, and his voice faded slightly as he turned to his friends. Were not in trouble. Shes asking about the accident..Ron, Maggie cut in. Did you see it? Were you involved? She began pacing.Ron moved the phone away from his ear as she raised her voice. , and no, and ! Its pretty crazy actually. We left the theater almost right after the movie ended, and Noah wanted to ask the cute girl at the register for her number-Noah cut in. Dude! Are you really telling her about that?!-But chickened out and got another Coke instead but forgot a straw. So guess what idiot tried to drink from their cup  and  a straw?While Ron explained, Maggie collapsed on the couch, making Lucas stir awake. Relax, Maggs, hell be home soon, Im sure. Go to bed, he mumbled, half asleep.Maggie ignored him and addressed her son. Ron, spit it out. Youre making it sound like you got in an accident.Lucas started, wide awake now. Rons hurt?! Maggie waved him off.Hes fine, she snapped, then softened her voice. Ok, go on. She placed the phone on speaker.Hey Ron.Oh, hi Dad. So, let me be clear. . Noah spilled his drink and so we pulled over. And right as we did, this dumba-uh- driver, apparently drunk, in this huge truck whizzes by right where we just were. Hit the street light so hard it broke and fell across the road. If we had been there, n hadnt pulled over Ron trailed off, giving a breathy, relieved chuckle. But we did, soPraise God that youre safe! Maggie clutched Lucass hand.Yeah, praise God. Whether or not Ron meant it, she didnt know. But Maggie and Lucas meant it from the bottom of their hearts. Anyway we took a detour so well be home in five, ten minutes.All right. Thanks, Ron. Love you.There was a small hesitation. Love you too, Mom. He hung up amid his friends teasing.Maybe Ron wouldnt be home by his curfew, but at least he was safe.Maggie, now that you know hes safe, you can stop worrying and go to bed. Lucas stood up, stretched, and went to follow his own recommendation."
reality window,"It's the beginning of spring, in the central city of America. The mid-age man of 45 years old is working on his laptop. He's the lazy and boring person of all time.

Solstice 3:33,"It is late night. I am still up. You can say I am a night owl. With my work schedule being 1 PM to 9 PM, I got into the habit of going to bed at two in the morning, and I usually wake up at 10 AM. I am not complaining for now. I do have weekends off. On the weekend, I dont abuse by waking up past noon. Oh no! I kept my sleep and wake up time steady, seven days a week. I love to sleep and I enjoy naps too on the weekends, especially in the afternoon, after lunch.   Its Friday night, and the clock shows 9:00 PM! Yes! My weekend has started! I officially fall on vacation at this instant. I will be off from work for the next two weeks for the holidays. I have just noticed that autumn will end in a few hours. It is a quite cold night, with a heavy snow fall warning in effect. Winds are picking up. So glad to work from the comfort of my home.    I will order a pizza from Dominos tonight with some chicken wings and a good can of Coke. This is my little way of rewarding myself. Weekend has begun, so is my vacation. Little treat is good time to time. After supper, let me get some popcorn and find a good movie on Netflix. I feel like watching a horror movie, if not, a suspense, or mystery.   Supper was great, along with that cheesecake. I finally decided to watch The Exorcist. Again? Yes! The movie is a classic, a masterpiece of the horror genre. Almost fifty years old since its release and it still haunts me at night after I go to bed after watching that movie.    Exceptionally, tonight, I will not be going to bed at 2 AM. The pizza came in late, and therefore, I started the movie late also. I am on vacation, so I wanted to take it easy. I will wake up, perhaps, at noon. With this coffee that I had after my cheesecake; I feel great. I really dont mind a coffee late night, especially during a cold winter night. Most of the time, I can fall asleep fairly easily even after a cup of dark roast Columbian coffee.    Where I live, it is a rural area. Closest neighbor is at least a good 5-minute drive. So that tells you that I am alone when I live. Here, on cold winter nights, it could become so quiet, peaceful, calm, that gives you a sense of a very haunting place. Kind of a ghost town with one house   Tonight, I hear an owl hoot. Tonight, also, winter starts. The end of fall season in a few minutes. The winter solstice begins at 3:33 AM. Let me sit near the window of the living room before I go to bed. I will read narrative poem of Edgar Allan Poe. The Raven. Then, bedtime.    As I am about to start reading, I hear the hooting of the owl getting stronger in decibels. I look out from the window. I see a shadowy figure standing beside the tree that is a hundred feet away from my window. It looks like a man with a long raincoat and wearing a hat. I can see only his lips. I see him holding a book in his right arm. To me, someone outside, at this time, on a blowing snow night, seems quite bizarre.   The man was still for a good five minutes but now I see him approaching towards my house. What do I do? Should I call the cops? As I grab my cell phone, I see there is no service. I no longer use landline. I had disconnected the service a few years ago. Big mistake now that I think of it. Usually, cell coverage is good here though. I am looking from the window and man is getting closer and closer. As if my window is focusing only on him now. Like a lens focusing on an object. I move away from the window and close the curtains.I would not be afraid but at this time, in this weather, and I dont know this man. What is the purpose of his visit?    I hear a big bang on the front door. Three loud knocks! I froze on the spot. I am afraid. Scared. I am panicking. Who knocks on a strangers door at 3:33 AM? Wait! What? It is 3:33 AM? The time that the winter solstice begins.    I am not moving. I dont want him to know that there is someone home. Maybe he will leave. I wish I had a dog. A guard dog. I hear no noise. I sneak a peak from the window but I see no soul. The problem is that I cant see from that living room window if someone is standing at the front door. The angle does not allow it.   My feet are frozen from this cold floor. I am not trying to move. I am still like a statue. I hope this person, whoever he is, goes away. Maybe I should go to my computer and see if I can alert the authorities.    I am tired but I cant go to bed till I am sure this individual is gone from my front door. It is now 3:44. I cant stay still like this forever   I pick up my baseball bat, approach the door. Look from the peephole. No one to see. I open the door. No one to see. I look to my left, I look to my right, I look to the front againno one   I hear now again the owl hooting. Where? To my left, on the tree. It seems like it moved from a farther three to this one now. What is the significance of what just happened? Did winter come knock on my door. Is this a warning? That manthat mysterious man, he seemed like Father Lankester Merrin from the movie I just saw earlier. All these coincidences are weird. The movies I as watching earlier tonight and the start of the winter season. Is someone or something trying to say to me something"
The Winning advertisement dow,"What is in a window? If one speaks the word window by splitting it into two halves, the result will be 'Win' and 'Dow'. 'Win' means to achieve victory in something while 'Dow' means something of value or something which is worthy. Combining it, the result is a thing which is worth of victory or something capable of giving someone victory. Watching outside the window aspires someone to become something or aids someone not to do something in life so that catastrophe does not occur in his/ her life as well as their family members' life.Now question arises, what a window helps you to become?It helps you to become a painter by watching nature filled with mountains, cool air, flowing crystal clear waterfalls and many more. It helps you to become an NGO by helping poor people, a dancer by seeing the trees dancing to the tunes of the breeze, a motivational speaker by seeing the black clouds of depression fade away due to the motivational power of the wind, become a hiker by dreaming to scale tall and humongous mountains, a Navy officer or a navigator by sailing through the rivers, a geologist by investigating rocks, an astronomer by studying the stars and planets in the solar system, a marine biologist by studying different marine animals, and if nothing else then a writer or at the end, a matured citizen of a civilized country. A window helps you to beleive in god and his creation if you are an atheist and makes you beleive more in the the power of God if you believe in Him. It also helps you solve family issues and teaches life lessons. When one sees the tight grip of the roots holding a tree, it reminds us of our forefathers who are already forgotten that how hard they worked to earn us this living. It also inspires us to carry the same bond with our descendants as the buds of a tree do. A flower outside the window on the garden inspires us to stay blossomed and bright in the family during tough times abd give them some fragrance of help and petals of hope. A flower also teaches us to help the world and not ask anything in return. The tall mountains tell us to stay strong in any conditions as they did in different seasons and to keep your chin up even though you are poor. Black cloud teach us not to become rude with others or there will be rains of anger and disputes in the family while the clear sky tells us to become pure from the bottom of our heart. The sun teaches us to shine everyday even though the black clouds of depression cover and hover around you. The flowing river teaches us to flow even tough rocky situations come in our way while the ocean teaches us not to be lazy like her or impurities will cover you. The breeze teaches us to stay calm in every situation while a gale or a thunderstorm shows us the result of what devastation will happen if we get angry. Fire teaches us to stay lively. But on the other aspect of teaches us even to glow in the dark, sad and depressing times of your family without any fuel. A withered leaf teaches us not to get separated from our family while a trunk tells us to stay close to your family. Well let's keep aside the elements of nature but let's talk about our topic window.What can and must one learn from a window?A translucent window passes good rays of sunlight instead the harmful ultra- violet rays. Similarly we must protect our family from bad vibes of the world. In monsoons and winters, rain and snow cover the windows and prevent the sunlight to enter the house. We regularly clean the windows after snow and rain so that again the sunlight enters into the house. So taking this as an example, always realise that if you get into trouble or get yourself covered with demotivation then keep in mind that there is always a helping hand to clean you. Simultaneously, you must also help others to clean the rain and snow from their windows. Weaker windows break easily but stronger windows resist even a bullet shot from a sniper gun. This teaches us to stay strong because there are many people who learn from you.We can precisely say that a window is a dictionary of life. Let's read a similar story on this topic.It was a gloomy day when a poor lad was walking on the street, who had everything except money. His sister's marriage was lined up next week with a worthy politician who needed a car and few other things in dowry. He needed money instantly and thought to injure himself seriously by crashing himself into a truck and then bribing the driver for money. He was just watching the trucks and cars go by when an advertisement window showed up. It read someone's quote which said ""I have seen many poor people who only have money but nothing else. There are many rich people who have happiness and family in the world but no money."" He went to the advertisement board and read further. ""The bigshots earn money without perseverance by conducting various scams and scandals as they don't have much experience and thus they fall from grace. While a poor man who is acquainted with failure does not matter loss. Every bigshot has a criminal stain left in the pages of history while a poor man doesn't. So if you think that you are poor or jobless, then work hard. Join our club where you will find your job as quickly as possible.

The Terrible Terrible Accident,"Time for bed! I heard from downstairs, while playing Minecraft. Oh boy, not again, I could hear my mom calling me. She does that every single night before I go to bed. How annoying! Well, I know she cares at least, but Id rather be playing my game than go to bed. Knock, knock, knock I hear on my bedroom door. Honey, can I come in? my mom says. I say, Okay, Ma, thats what Ive called her ever since I could talk. She brings me water and a banana with peanut butter for my bedtime snack. She still doesnt understand that I hate bananas, so I eat a piece of it and leave the rest on the plate. She tells me to turn off my game every night too. She just doesnt understand. Oh well, I guess I better get to bed since its like midnight. I hear, Johnny, go to bed right now! She hates when Im up late. Shed rather I read a book in bed first, she always says it will help me to go to sleep. Read a book? No one reads books anymore, do they? Well, I guess for school Ill have to, how boring! I better check my English homework, Im supposed to read Shakespeare. Can you believe? Im in Grade 10 and Im only allowed to use my phone for emergencies! So, no I dont have my phone with me before bed and its so difficult for me to sleep, but apparently the phone before bedtime is bad for you. Something to do with the blue lights; at least thats what my Ma tells me. But really I think its just an excuse so that I cant have my phone in bed. Finally, I decide to listen to Ma and get into bed. She is right though. I just lay here and cannot get to sleep. Then I hear from downstair, Just close your eyes, Johnny! So weird, like how does she even know when shes downstairs? She says she knows I cant sleep. I guess she is right again, because I finally close my eyes and am in LaLa Land.Watch out Ma! Screeeeeech!! Crash. I wake up sweating from head to toe. Screaming and crying. My Ma runs into my bedroom. She says, Whats wrong? Are you okay honey? Ma, Ma Im crying uncontrollably. Ma, I had a terrible dream! Youre okay. Dont be silly, Johnny. But Ma, we crashed! Please dont drive ever again. Please, please! Ma says, Oh Johnny, dont be silly, dreams arent real!The next day at school I tell my best friend about my dream and how scared I am to drive in the car. I was so scared that I even walked to school this morning. My Ma actually let me since Im in Grade 10 now and the school is close to my home. My best friends name is Phil and I told him all about my scary dream. He actually believed me. I mean hes my best friend so he has to believe me! Right?But Ma, she just wouldnt believe me, she still doesnt. Even this morning she kept saying, Dont be silly, Johnny! It makes me so mad that she doesnt believe me. I begged her not to drive, so I sure hope she wont go out today.Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash, to the office, Johnny Cash to the office I hear over the loud speaker. Oh no, whats wrong? Im thinking, I mean I never get called to the office. Are you kidding? With my Ma and how over protective she is and all her rules, Im like the best kid ever! I never do anything wrong. But truthfully, Im glad about that. I have a couple of nice friends and I never worry, because all the teachers like me.Finally, I arrive at the office to see my dad there. His eyes are all red, like he had been crying. If you knew my dad, he never cries! Are you kidding me? Hes like a macho guy, hes bald, with huge muscles and super tall! No one messes with him! Im like him though, Im already six feet tall and still growing. I have thick, brown hair like my Ma and blue eyes, like my dad. My dads name is Robert, Bobby for short. Oh, I forgot to mention, my dad doesnt live with us right now, something to do with a stupid separation. My parents dont say much, except that they need time apart for now, but dont worry Johnny. I hear that all the time too, Dont worry Johnny! I do remember one day last year, I arrived home from school to hear my parents yelling at each other. It wasnt fun to hear, so I went in the backyard, I didnt want them to know I was home from school yet and heard them. Then I heard a car screech out of the driveway only to find out the next day that my dad wasnt going to be home for awhile, if ever.Dad says, Hurry, we have to go! I get in his black Land Rover and we speed away. Dad, whats wrong? He doesnt even talk, I just see tears rolling down his face. All he could say was, Your Mom, she, she was in an accident. So, I decide to be quiet for the rest of the drive. We pull up to, St. Josephs Hospital and run inside. I hear my dad say quietly to the first nurse he sees, Colleen Cash, where is she? The nurse says, Oh shes in the ER, Mr. Cash, follow me. So she leads us to where Ma is. We find her sound asleep in the private ER room.All I kept thinking was about my dream a few nights ago. I know its terrible, but its all I could think about. Even though my Ma was laying there with all these tubes attached to her arms and the beeping noises; its all I could think about. I mean its like I had a premonition. I knew it, I even told Ma not to drive. I was so scared. My dad just stood there crying, not saying anything. Finally, I started crying too!That night my dad and I drove home in silence. I mean I still didnt know what really happened, but at least my Ma was okay. I mean I dont know what I would do if she was gone. Shes like my saviour. But she didnt believe me, I mean my dream, it was a premonition. I knew dreams had meanings, but I didnt know they could be real until now.The next morning, my dad says I dont have to go to school. Instead my dad and I go back to the hospital to see, Ma. Its weird, because Ive never once been in a hospital. Well, except for when I was born of course, but I dont remember that. We finally arrive at the hospital and go right to Mas room. Today, shes in a new room upstairs. So we go up in the elevator. Its so quiet in the hospital, much different than school! I notice my dad has a bouquet of red roses with him. I guess he really loves Ma, I mean I still dont get why they wanted to separate, but I have stopped asking questions. We walk in her hospital room and her eyes are open. My dad runs over to her and hugs her. Hes crying like Ive never seen before and Ma is crying too. Wow, thats what love is, I kept thinking to myself.My Ma had to stay in the hospital for awhile before she could come home. But my dad finally explained to me that my Ma was in a terrible, terrible car accident. Someone ran the red light; they had been drinking and driving. My dad said that Ma was so lucky to be alive, but luckily the other car swerved and hit her car from the side rather than head on. He kept repeating, Thank God, thank God, thank God. Now remember this is a man that you wouldnt want to mess with!Finally, the next day my dad told me Ma was coming home. He told me I better get back to school and that I could walk home from school, because he would be picking Ma up from the hospital. Shed be home when I arrived. So that day at school I couldnt concentrate, all I could think about was Ma finally being home. I couldnt wait! Apparently, I missed a week of school, but I didnt even realize it. My teachers told me I didnt have to worry about the work I missed. They would update me on anything necessary. Oh by the way, Ive been on the honour roll ever since I can remember, so missing a week was no big deal. I mean I get nineties without even trying.So, finally I arrived home that day and my dads car was in the driveway. My Mas car was a write-off. I guess my Ma wouldnt need her car for awhile. I run inside yelling, Ma,Ma,Ma! My Ma says, Honey, Im in the living room. I have never been happier to see my Ma. Oh and my Ma said to me, Honey, you were right. I knew she was referring to my terrible dream, but I just smiled and said, Ma, Im just so glad youre finally home, I missed you. My dad came in the living room and told me he was moving back home and would never be leaving again. I was the happiest kid ever!!"
Morana,"She dragged a stone and sat on it trying to peer through the slit. Oh, the stone was not tall enough. She wasn't able to see outside clearly when she sat on it. She looked around and ran to pick up a dry leaf that had fallen into the log. She laid the leaf on the log floor and folded it several times and pressed it down with both her tiny arms to lessen the bumpiness. She kept the bundle of folded-dry-leaf on top of the stone. The leaf crackled as she adjusted herself on top of it. Now the seat had the right height, and she could keep watching outside as much as she wanted.Morana was her name. She lived in a mushroom growing inside a decaying log. She won't go out of the log during the day; when the sunlight filled the forest. She only came out at night; in the realm of darkness. For, she was a malevolent dwarf that caused death and decay by simply being present.It was early morning and Morana was ready to do what she usually did, almost every day. The forest was slowly coming alive. The silence was quickly broken by the chirping of birds. The air filled up with the scent of blooming flowers and soon came out the benevolent dwarfs that made flowers bloom and plantlets grow from their mere touch.Morana kept looking at them as long as she could. She was always mesmerized by their beautiful clothes made of colorful flower petals. She sometimes imagined herself in one of them; a beautiful gown made of sunflower petals, running and dancing with other benevolent dwarfs. A smile would always draw across her chubby face making her cheeks turn red at such thoughts. Once she even tried to make a nice flower-petal dress for herself; she secretly went near a freshly bloomed, beautiful daisy flower. She climbed onto a stone nearby, and with trembling hands touched its petals. To her dismay, the flower soon wilted and dried up.She looked at the benevolent dwarfs and thought how beautiful they were with pink smiling faces and green eyes. She wanted to become their friend. When she slept, she would always dream of playing with them. In her dreams at least, they adored her, despite her pale skin and jet-black eyes that turned red whenever her dark magic worked.She didn't spell flowers, leaves, or plantlets to wilt and die intentionally; she only had to come in contact with them, and the magic would happen on its own.Although Morana was aware of all the names of the benevolent dwarfs in her neighborhood, none of them even knew of Morana's presence in the old decaying log.The other dwarfs were playing with a ball made of pollen, which accidentally got thrown onto the log where Morana lived and fell through a hole into it, only a few feet away from Morana. The dwarfs started looking for the lost ball everywhere.Morana took a glance at the disappointed dwarfs who weren't able to spot their ball and with trembling hands, she walked towards the ball. She kept looking at it for several long seconds, closed her eyes, and let out a deep sigh. She tried to keep her powers under control and picked up the ball from both her hands. Taking a small peek at the ball through a half-open eye; she saw that the ball was still golden and not turned brown under her power. She slowly opened her eyes and with determination quickly came out of her hiding place.The other dwarfs didn't notice her silent approach at first. She walked silently towards Rosemerelda who was the closest to her. Holding the ball in front of her, Morana whispered Rosemerelda's name, who turned with a startle hearing a deep whispering voice.Rosemerelda had never seen a dwarf, like the one who was standing close to her; with a pale face, black untidy hair, and black eyes. She was wearing a dress made out of a dry leaf, with stains of berries. Actually, Morana had tried to add some color to her dress by trying to paint on it with the juice of berries.Rosemerelda remembered the dark stories about malevolent dwarfs that her mother used to tell her, warning her not to wander too deep into the forest. Malevolent dwarfs were cruel and cunning. They hated light and colors. They always tried to steal away happiness.Before Rosemerelda could react, her friends had already started to panic. They were shrieking, running away, and calling for help. Rosemerelda was frozen with fear. She couldn't reach for her friends as they had already run far away. She turned and looked again at Morana.Meanwhile, Morana could feel her heart beating fast, and a ringing sound in her ears. She knew she had taken the wrong decision. She should have waited, hiding in her log, pretending not to exist. But now, there was no turning back. She could feel her power taking advantage of her overwhelmed feelings and rising inside her.Rosemerelda watched Morana's eyes turning red, and the golden ball in her hands drying and turning brown. Her shriek wasn't escaping her trembling lips. But then she was dragged away from Morana by Forge; her brother.Forge noticed the strange dwarf when he stopped his search for the ball midway and turned to see why everyone was shrieking. She stood their dark and bold handing over their ball at Rosemerelda who stood there unmoving appearing to be frozen. He wasn't scared by the stranger until her eyes turned red, that's when he thought to grab Rosemerelda and run away to safety where others had already gone.Morana ran away to the log and hid in her mushroom. But the dwarf community was shaken by the story of a malevolent dwarf hiding close to their habitat, who had even attacked their children. Soon the story reached Queen Esmerelda.""The creature had tried to attack your daughter my queen!""""Where is Rosemerelda now?""""She's sleeping my queen. The poor child has a fever. I wonder if that disgusting creature spelled her!""Forge overheard the conversation in his mother's room.""She didn't attack mother, I thought she was giving us back our ball, but then she destroyed the ball"" he shrugged his shoulders.""Did you see her Forge?""""Yes mother, she was just like us but paler and had black hair and red eyes""""Did you see her spelling your sister?""""No, Rosemerelda was very scared. She swore she heard her calling her name.""""The dark creature had spelled our princess!"" the queen's adviser seemed to hate dwarfs of darkness.Not only him, but the whole kingdom was frightened by the story of a malevolent dwarf spelling their princess. Queen Esmerelda had to order the soldiers to imprison the creature of darkness to restore peace in her kingdom.It took no time for the soldiers to destroy the decaying log and find Morana.Forge was sorry for her when he saw her at the palace being chained and caged. She stood balled up, hiding her face in her knees and lifting it slowly only to see what was going on. Her black eyes were swollen and wet. His heart would tell him, that she was innocent but he had his doubts.That night Forge couldn't sleep. His mind was disturbed by the thought of a lonely dwarf, feeling scared and cold in the palace dungeon. He decided to check on her and find out her true intentions.Down to the dungeons he went in stealth, hiding in the shadows and escaping the eagle eyes of guards. He kept watching Morana hiding away in the darkness to see what she was up to. Hours ticked by but she did nothing but keep hiding her face. The paintings on her dress were cute. Flowers, birds, and smiling dwarfs. He wondered why she wouldn't draw all the bad symbols of death and darkness.Then she stood up, dried away her tears with her hands, and came closer to the prison bars to talk to the guard.""Please let me go! I didn't mean to hurt anyone.""""Get back you dark creature, don't think that I would fall for your nasty tricks,"" the guard would shout.Forge understood that he was scaring her even more, her lips began to tremble and her hands began to shake. She held onto the prison bars. But soon, her eyes turned all red and the bars began to melt. He was scared by her power and so was the guard, who called others in alarm. But very clearly he remembered seeing Morana's eyes wide with fear as she looked at her own hands.The next morning came the news that the creature of darkness has destroyed a prison cell and also attacked several guards.Meanwhile, away from the kingdom of benevolent dwarfs stood the kingdom of malevolent dwarfs where the forest was always dark and shadowy and filled with marshes. Where the only life forms available were frogs, rats and owls apart from the dwarfs.The fears of other dwarfs weren't something pointless as the dwarfs of the darkness were nothing like Morana. They were wicked and cruel.From ancient times, the benevolent dwarfs and malevolent dwarfs were in constant wars that never ceased. Day and night the good dwarfs protected the forest and the life in it from the dark powers. Every single day a few brave dwarfs would suffer death, sickness, and disability. But somehow life and death would always balance. Until powerful Remorus became king of the malevolent dwarfs.Remorus showed no mercy; he hated life, laughter, and happiness. The malevolent dwarfs were unstoppable under his blood-thirsty guidance. Many suffered death and the ones alive, lived hidden in barrows underground while darkness overruled the surface.Remorus's rule was breaking the balance between life and death. The forest was slowly turning lifeless. But soon, a young and brave dwarf called Lumina defeated Remoras.Remorus was clever, never giving up, and furious but Lumina was gifted. She was the eldest daughter of King Arthur, sister of Esmerelda. No dwarf ever had seen such powerful magic. Remorus was not powerful as Lumina. The dark armies suffered severe damage and had to retreat. But Remorus shot a poison arrow right through Lumina's heart.Before she died, Lumina had spelled her power into her ring and gave it to Esmerelda who was by her side when she died. Esmerelda having a brave heart just like her sister ruled the kingdom after King Arthur using the power of the ring to protect her kingdom. King Remorus was still out there, looking for his chance to return.King Remorus walked up and down, his dark cape floating behind him. His brows knotted together and his nostrils flared. Anger boiling in his eyes.""Keeping one of our children as a prisoner!"" he roared. ""How dare she?"" The news about Morana had by now reached the Dark palace.King Remorus hadn't only been waiting all this time, but he was preparing for the next attack.""It's time to break the silence again.""Dark had fallen in the kingdom of light. Prince Forge and Princess Rosemerelda were on a mission, moving in the shadows of the dungeon. The guards in the dungeon were fewer that night as most of them were summoned to the army with the news of the malevolent army approaching their kingdom.Forge distracted the guard near Morana's cell by making the guard follow him while Rosemerelda opened up the prison and unlocked all the chains imprisoning Morana. Morana looked astonished. Rosemerelda looked at Morana's face all wet with tears and her bruised ankles and wrists.""We are so sorry,"" she whispered.Morana was too surprised to speak. Happy tears welled in her eyes. At least one person liked her.""How did you know my name?""""I was always there in the log, watching you play. I meant no harm.""""Why didn't you come out?""""I knew no one would like me.""Rosemerelda touched Moranas hand and smiled at her.""Where is your family?""Morana remembered being carried on her father's shoulders, her mother beside them talking to her and laughing. She was so small. They played all around the forest at night. She remembered her mother touching a leaf and her eyes glowing red. She was awed by her mother's beauty. She then showed the bright red leaf in her arm at Morana.""Death is a part of life just like birth. It's sad, brings grief but death is essential for the life cycle to be active.""Unlike Morana, her mother had good control over her powers. She made leaves dry up into different colors; red, yellow, brown, purple. Her dress was made of dry leaves of different hues and her hair adorned with a crown of multi-colored, dried flowers.She remembered hearing shouts and booms nearby, her mother took her off her father's shoulders and ran away into the forest. She kept calling for her father all the way, but her mother hushed her and cradled her. They were being chased. An enchanted thorny vine encircled them, although her mother spelled it, the thorns had already poisoned her. her mother instructed her to run away and hide until her father found her.""Life is not forever Morana, enjoy it while it lasts. Although our powers are dark, remember that light is unworthy without darkness.""She ran as far as she could as her mother instructed her. She waited for her father, but he never came. She was hungry. She saw a dwarf mother giving round juicy berries for her child. She slowly came out of her hiding place and slowly walked towards them. Their eyes were wide with fear when they saw a creature of darkness coming out of her hiding place but maybe as she was small they handed her a berry. But when she took it to her hand, the berry just withered and died making her eyes turn all red. The rest of the memory was not pleasant.It was the last time she went near other dwarfs. She never found others like her. She thought that they were extinct as she didn't know that they were driven away to a faraway place in the forest. She was not ever able to control her powers completely although she learned to eat berries without spoiling them and forever in hiding she lived wishing, she was like others.""They died.""""Come with us. We'll help you escape.""Forge had now joined them. They guided Morana out of the palace and into the forest.Morana was running as fast as she could, away from others. When she heard shouts and booms. She climbed onto a tree, higher and higher until she saw what was going on.She could see two armies fighting. She couldn't believe her eyes! There were more like her! Life and death were fighting against each other, light and darkness trying to overpower one another. Precious lives being lost on both sides. Children would become orphans like her. She could recognize Queen Esmerelda on the war front. What if she .,what would happen to Rosemerelda and Forge?Rage, disappointment, sadness, grief began to overwhelm Morana but mixed with them was compassion and forgiveness. Her power had seized her. She rose into the air more like a fairy than a dwarf. And like a lightning bolt, she landed on the war ground, separating the two armies with a powerful wind.No one had witnessed such power after Princess Lumina who had the power to control the wind, water, and fire, in addition to the normal power of benevolent dwarfs. But most of all, they were surprised to see that this power was now owned by a malevolent dwarf.""Life and death both are parts of one cycle. It's foolish how you act as if you don't see that. Why can't you see the similarities between us hidden among our differences?""King Remorus looked at the little girl wearing a dress made of dried leaves. He looked at her pointed nose, wide mouth, and big black eyes which were turned all red with power. Tears began to prick his eyes, and his heart throbbed to hug her tight.The memory of his wife dying in his arms and telling him to protect their daughter; kept darkening his mind, suffocating his heart and numbing all his senses turning him into a monster. He had been destroying everything, avenging his wife and searching for his lost daughter. Finally, he found her, how much had he missed her. His daughter.""Morana!""Morana identified his voice. All this time she thought he was dead. Her dark eyes turned golden as she ran into his arms. Plantlets and flower buds sprang from where her foot touched the ground.Everyone wondered why nature gifted Morana; the daughter of the dark king Remorus, with such powers.The war between the two kingdoms stopped. All the dwarfs learned to live peacefully, respecting each other's powers and using their own wisely.Morana was always the strange one among her friends, but she didn't wish that she wasn't different than others. She learned that one can be different but still fit in. She knew that whether our powers are dark or not, we can always choose whom we want to be. In the end, our perceptions and actions would define who we are."
The Prince and the Scullery Maid,"Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a kind King. The King was wise and good, and all of his subjects loved him. The King, however, was unhappy, because his son, the Prince, was a rotten boy who complained all day long and remained ungrateful for all he had.	My son must be taught a lesson if he is to become king after me, the King said to the Fairy Godmother.	What would you wish for me to do, my king? She asked.	Please dear Fairy Godmother, with all your wisdom and grace, please help my son. Teach him a lesson so that one day he may rule as wisely as I.	This I can do, but beware, my king, this lesson will come with a price he must pay. She warned.	He needs to be taught, dear Fairy Godmother. I have failed him as a father, but if you help him, he will be redeemed.	Very well, she said, and then disappeared in a poof of dust.	The Prince was in his quarters, bored and angry from being in lessons all day. His face was still red from yelling and throwing a tantrum.	I never get to do what I want. I hate being here, he said to no one in particular. Just then, the Fairy Godmother appeared before him, causing him such fright.	My, my, good Fairy, you scared me! How dare you enter my quarters unannounced! He yelled.	Young Prince, I have come to make a deal with you. An offer I think you might like. Please excuse my abrupt appearance, but I thought this was an issue of great importance. She said with a smile.	The Prince was intrigued and said, You are forgiven Fairy Godmother, now tell me, what is this deal you wish to offer me?	Let me ask you this dear little Prince, do you love your life here?	The prince gave it some thought and then answered,  No. I hate it here. I think everyone knows that. I am in lessons all day that bore me and get scolded when I climb a tree or play with the gardeners boy. Im always being told what to do and how I have to do the right thing. I wish I wasnt a prince!	Very well. Just as I suspected. My dear little Prince, if you give up something of value, I am willing to give you a different life in exchange. So, what shall you give up?	The prince looked around his quarters, and saw all his fine things; the toys and books he cared nothing for. His eyes fell to the painting of his family, his fathers crown catching his eye. A prince, I want to give up being a prince!	Very well, said the Fairy Godmother, and with a quick wave of her wand, the Prince was transported.	Get to scrubbing! An old Cook said, throwing a bucket of dirty soap water on the floor near the Princes feet.	With a start, the Prince came to and looked all about him. He was in the lower levels of the castle, in the big kitchen, his body covered in dirt and grime. His whole body ached as if he had spent all day running and playing.	Now, come here you scullery maid, I want to see how well youre getting on. The cook said.	What? The Prince replied, and then looked down, his body had changed! He was now a girl, dressed in a shabby peasant dress and no shoes on his feet. In his hand was a mop. What did this Fairy Godmother do to me? He asked himself as he began to mop the floor.	The Princes days were filled with mopping the floor of the grand kitchen, scrubbing the pots, and helping the Cook when she needed it. He was never left alone to do what he wanted, and his bed was a little mat by the fire. He was always getting into trouble for doing things wrong, and his body hurt more than he could have ever thought possible. This is worse than before, I hate this! I want my old life back! He cried one night.	As the Prince sat crying alone in his room, the Fairy Godmother appeared before him once more.	My dear little Prince, whyever are you so sad? Is this not what you wanted? A life different from what you had?	You must think youre so very clever, Fairy Godmother! This life is the worst yet! I hate being a scullery maid! I have to wear all of this, and am never allowed to go play outside and forced to clean all day! Its the worst yet. I want my old life back! Please Fairy Godmother, what can I do? Surely you can help me. He pleaded before her.	But my dear little Prince, did you not want a life different from your own? Are you sure you want to go back to your lessons and be a prince?	The Prince looked up and dried his eyes. Yes Fairy Godmother, I have learned that I like my lessons, they are more interesting than I had thought before. I like running around the garden, even if I cant climb a tree. I didnt know there could be anything worse but now I do. I am grateful for all I had. Please Fairy Godmother, let it be as it was.	You have true repentance, and that is your salvation. Go to sleep now my little Prince, and when you wake all will be as it was.	So the Prince did as she said, and climbed onto his little mat by the fire. When he woke the next morning he was back in his old bed, his dress gone and replaced with his shirt and trousers. Hooray! I am back to my old self again! He said with delight. He ran around his room, hugging his toys and books. He went on to become known as a smart lad, who was studious with his lessons, and as kind as his father. He never talked down to the servants, especially the scullery maids, and showed respect to everyone. He and his kingdom lived happily ever after."
My Hell,"TW: SuicideThe night is dark. Darker than chocolate. You know what else is dark? People. Its been a week since I teleported into an unknown world. The people here look like humans, like you and me. But they have powers. Powers that are unusual. When we think of a supernatural power, we think about flying, shooting lasers out of our eyes, or reading minds. No dear reader. I'm not talking about those powers. These powers that these people hold dear is not supernatural. It is worse. They have the power to hurt or help. No, these people aren't dictators, theyre not gods. Though, they could be if they tried. So here am I, walking alone in the night, in an unknown world, with people who have the power to destroy or create.Also, one more thing. It is always nighttime here. No daylight. But you can see very clearly in the dark. It is as if you dont need light. So where am I? Dear reader, like I said before, I do not know. I only know I am a mere human in a world of monsters.Before I continue, I must tell you how I ended up in this cold dark world. It started off as a bad day. I got up, bumped my toe on the bed, screamed in pain. Limped to the bathroom to brush my teeth, only to realize I had no toothbrush because I was poor. Damn you rich folks! So, in pain and frustration, I got dressed, walked out of the little shabby home, and bumped into a police men. You see, in my country, politicians are very corrupt. So I got a fine for bumping into a police man. How ridiculous. I went to work late as usual. My boss got tired of me getting late so he fired me that day. Now jobless, going to be homeless, I decided that my life isn't worth it. I got a rope, tied it to a lamppost and my neck. And I jumped. And my body dangling like a door bell, it was a funny sight... wait.. I could see my body?Here, with my consciousness, I see myself dangling like some ornament for Christmas. Was I dead? If I was, I should've done this long time ago. It didn't hurt a bit. While I was enjoying my new freedom, it happened. Yes, dear reader, it happened. The moment where you fall into heaven or hell depending on whether you were a good use in the physical world or not. But I did not land on any of those places. Instead, I landed in an unknown world, dark, cold, and steady eyes staring at me. Dear reader, if I had a physical body, I might have pissed myself.The landing didn't hurt one bit. More of a feeling of landing on fluffy clouds. Not that I know how clouds feel like, I'm just assuming. The atmosphere was very cold and the setting was very dark. But my eyes adjusted very quick and it was as if I didn't need any lights. And that's when I saw them. Those vile creatures. Dear reader, remember when I told you that they have the power to destroy or create? Those creatures destroyed me. Destroyed me without hesitation. Not destroyed me as in killing me, for I was already dead. But my heart felt like it would explode, and my mind fried. When I looked closely, I realized.. these creatures... these creatures looked just like me!""Wha..what"" I cried. Not only they looked like me, they had different expressions. And even though they looked human, they had wings. I cannot explain the characteristics of the wing because I dont think there is a word for it. I could point out several of their expressions. Such as anger, disgust, joy, sadness, and shock. Thats when it came to me. These creatures were my emotions. But you may ask, ""if theyre just emotions, how can they destroy or create?"" Dear reader, I am very glad that you asked. I said destroy because there were emotions that horrified me such as greed, lust, envy, indignation, and shame. Those feelings and emotions destroyed me because of those, I had lost my wife, my kids, and my friends. But what use are those when I'm dead, eh? But other emotions such as joy, trust, kindness, pity, calmness, and interest built me up. Those emotions helped me become a better man.But one emotion cannot mix with another. You can be happy, but you cannot be sad at the same time. There is no way. Nada. So it was natural for these human like figures to fight. But it was not only a fight in the outside, but in the inside as well. I faced constant battles of pain and suffering inside me, for they were my emotions and thoughts. This is why, dear reader, that I said they can destroy. And this battle happens quite often. I am writing this as fast as I can before they quarrel with each other again. But, they also create. I have created a sense of knowledge and common sense that some of the negativity emotions started to disappear. Yes, my mission was to get rid of the negative and hurtful thoughts and emotions. So there is a time of peace for some time and a time of war at others. But it is much better than when I arrived. There is no clock or calendar here in this dark world. So I cannot tell you how many days, months, or years have passed. But if I was to guess, I have passed around 50 birthdays. But I dont feel old or young.I know most of you readers will not believe in me. How can one fall into a pit of darkness? How can one see their inner demons? That my reader, you must find out by yourself. ""You want us to kill ourselves?"" Noooo... I do not mean that dear reader. I mean find out till you die or something. I do not wish you to kill yourself. Very tragic. I did it because well, there is no good reason. I have destroyed about 80% of the negative emotions by now. Less wars in me. I have found peace at some time. I still tend to get out of here. In a sense, I am an outsider. These creatures look like me, but they are different than me. I am one, they are many. I must adapt to this place which I have difficult doing. Once in a while, I do see a glimpse of light. Maybe there is a way to escape this hellish place. I am tired of groaning in pain and then feeling good in a spilt second. It is very tiring. I have tried to make peace with these creatures, but they dont like each other. So Im stuck with them for the rest of eternity.I have spent roughly 1000+ centuries in this place. I can see the light very clearly now. It is still out of reach. While I have found peace with these creatures, I will escape the very chance I have. This is my story readers. Wish me luck."
The Donkey & the Dating App,"There once was a groundhog named Gloria. She had an internet date over lunch at The Watering Hole, the hippest drinks establishment in town. Most animals had to wait in line to get a sip at the Hole. Her date was with a horse named Jack and they had met on Mating Call, an app where animals swipe up or down based on potential suitors photos. Cautiously, she opened the door of the bar and poked her black nose and snout into the establishment. She saw a giraffe, a cobra, a macaw, an opossum, and a donkey. No horse - she left. There once was an emu named Emilia. She also had an internet date from Mating Call at The Watering Hole. She stalked through the restaurant-slash-bar looking for her horse named Jack. Her head and lengthy neck led her body, moving with a bob through the tables. She didnt find a horse; she found a donkey with a sunflower. The profile said Jack was a palomino and sixteen hands tall. Instead, he was grey with a few wandering hairs of brown and only ten hands tall. He had a smirk to his white mouth and a foreleg looped around the back of his chair. His causal lean highlighted his portly belly. Youre not a horse. But I am Jack, the donkey brayed. Emilia did not sit down. Why should I give you the time of day if you start off with a lie? Ill pay for your food. Emilia sat down. What do you do? Jack asked. She told him that she worked in investment banking. She told him that she worked very long hours, so it was nice to get a break from the office and go on a date. She asked him what he did. Jack swirled his midday jack and coke. He had ordered it by telling the waiter that he wanted his namesake and gave an affected wink. Emilia did not order a drink. She had an important meeting after this. Jack leaned across the table and whispered, Im actually not allowed to say what I do. Contractually. Emilia gave him a piercing look. Can you keep a secret? Sure. She shrugged. Im actually a spy for the National Animal Relations Board. Emilia let slip a small squawk of laughter. He didnt hear it. Im only in town for a few weeks, tracking down this guy whos leading an illegal turtle racing ring. It would be amazing to have someone show me the sights while Im here. Jack lifted his jack and coke between his two hooves and took a sip. Her feathers were ruffled and puffed. Why did you say you were a horse on your profile? Animals tend to undervalue donkeys due to species prejudice. I mean, can you imagine the hits you would get if you said you were an ostrich instead of an emu? When animals think of an ostrich, they think of show girls. When animals think of a horse, they think of a stallion. Emilias feathers went full puff. She doubled in size. Excuse me?! An emu is a respectable, regal bird. I would never pretend I am an ostrich. They are harlots. She stood up and left The Watering Hole before her  had arrived. There once was an iguana named Indie. When she entered The Watering Hole, she was fifteen feet long instead of three. Her scales were a deep emerald green instead of pale chalk. She had no beard, no oblong spikes along her crest. Instead she had hard spikes that dotted the back of her hide, and a flat, wide nose, and a jaw that could break bones. There once was an alligator named Andie who said on her dating profile that she was an iguana named Indie. She was unsurprised to find that Jack was a donkey. OMG, I shouldve seen it! Youre a jackass. Of course, Jack would be a jackass. Its actually a family name. I get it. If you knew how many Allies were in my family, whew. Both girls and boys. Im just happy to be named Andie! Your name isnt Indie? No, that was just a typo that stuck. Her laugh was low and gravelly. Each time she laughed, the other tables looked at them out of the corners of their eyes, fur or feathers spiked. Jack gave his laugh, like a foghorn with its hees and haws. Same thing happened to me with the horse thing! So what do you do, Jack? Im an investigator for the Animal Relations Board and only in town for the next couple of weeks.  And you need someone to show you around? Exactly. It was a little awkward after his order of a hay salad, she ordered rare chevaline. She shrugged her left shoulder and said, Well, you aint a horse, so figured I didnt need to hold back. Besides that, the conversation was good. Both of them had spent some time in the South and talked a mean streak about the similarities and differences between country and blues. Andie offered to go on some sight seeing dates, maybe the River Crossing. You know, if you want, we could go back to my place. Im sure its tiring being in a hotel every night. Oh, Im not - Jack stopped himself, nearly blowing his love em and leave em cover story  - Im not going to say no to such a wonderful offer! Andie smiled, her jaw wide showing her pointed teeth. Jack paid the bill and they walked down the street. Im just around the corner, Andie said. This is a short cut. She took him into a dark, swampy alley. Moss grew on the brick. Trash, in and out of cans, lined the walls. I dont think Ive ever been on this street before, Jack said softly under his breath. His hooves splashed forward. He walked in ankle deep water that became deeper with every step. Really? All of the locals use it. Andie put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. Her claws scratched his hide. Whew, thats a tough grip you have there. The water was deep enough that Andie swam. She tightened her claw further, causing blood to run from his shoulder down his leg into the murky water. You have no idea. She opened her jaw and grabbed his back-right leg, shaking him until he lost his footing. He brayed for help and his mouth filled with water. His leg was in agony and he could feel himself being pulled deeper and deeper into the alley, into deeper and deeper water. Andie shook him back and forth, knocking his head against the right side and then the left side wall. His vision blurred and darkened. His head throbbed. He thought only of how much he hurt. The water was bottomless. His neck extended so he could still breathe. She pulled him further and his head slipped under the water. Jack was never seen at The Watering Hole or paired on the Mating Call app again."
The Merchant's Husband,"Gather round, those old and young. Come closer, and ye will be met with worlds of mystery. Sit at the stream, drink the sweet nectar within, and be reborn as is the phoenix from the ashes of the fire of the night. Stay at my shoes, and ye will be compelled to go forward with nothing but the stick of virtues and the sly hand. Our story begins when the moon shone above the world, moving downwards, perhaps contemplating crashing into the earth. The village was old. So old that Elder Mcallen could become one with the cracks on the buildings built near the river. The water had begun to chew on the land and spit it out as punishment for the farmers who did not wear belts on their waists. The folks would stop on their way through a town, not unlike that of the river, and use their forearms to reach the stall that was worth the suffering. There were two who never had to do this because they were already tending to the stand. It was the merchant and her husband. Their product was one thing of intrigue: a plant. This plant had a top that was reaching for the sun. The bottom looked like a childs toy that spun with magic. It was so good that the merchant and her husband would only sell to those who wanted legumes with this fantastical plant. The merchant and her husband would jingle as they walked because of it. Every 6th sunrise, the two of them would take a mare and a carriage, and go to harvest their mystical plant. They would be gone until the moon cast shadows in the water lilies for the second time. The merchant and her husband always returned with burlap sacks about to burst, ready for the coming days. The folks wanted to find the magical clouds where these plants fell from. They tried to follow the merchant and her husband into the trees that lapped at the North end of the village. They tried to be mice, to not be spotted. They tried to be snakes, wiggling among mud and root. They tried to be squirrels, pulling themselves up on branches and scurrying. Alas, to no avail. A fog covered the merchant. A mist covered the husband. Their tracks were taken with the wind. Not a soul could find the fabled spot. Those who searched would return with noses, ears, and eyes dripping red. Their hands would have disappeared. Their irises were soulless black husks that might have been portals to the underworld. Those who returned screamed in agony The nights were never peaceful. For whom the screaming was for was never clear. This was, at least, was rare. Most did not return at all, but were lost to the everlasting wood, which most likely only ended when the merchant saw fit. There were rumours that she who could not share a secret was a witch. She might need to be burned to leave the village to its tasks. The issue was that the harvest she and her husband provided was too important to the town, so she was left to do as she pleased. The merchants long hair was covered by a dirt coloured cloth that never moved. Her skirts were always stained by grass. Her face had not been washed in moons, yet she carried elegance. The villagers would cry out to her. How did she find the wonderful roots that could feed an angel? She would never let a word slip past her tongue. It was of no consequence the people who would plead, the length of their groveling, or how often they would fall to their knees and mumble into her filthy boots. The merchant had never opened her mouth to anyone who was not her husband. Even the husband was not one for canards. His small hands would be wiped quietly on an apron that was no longer white so he could touch his products. He would only speak of prices, which would always be wrong. Not one thing he said was ever the truth. The village was always frustrated by this pair. They had come here once upon a dawn and would leave twice the whisper of the night if the time ever arrived. Most would only interact for the food to give their family, and no more. A blessing from above must not be asked questions. Other whisperers did not agree. They would clench their teeth and breathe small rumors that had no base in any facts. When the sun left no shadow, a person in a ragged shawl and nothing more approached the stand. The husband and the merchant were speaking silently. The only indication of conversation was the small movement of broken lips. When the person came close, the pair turned toward them slowly. What will you be needing? The merchants husband demanded. The person, the stranger, did not offer a response. They instead focused on the husband. They traveled down his light yellow hair to his blue shirt. They lingered on a pendant, which might have been glowing with green sparks. The chain it was attached to swung off of the husbands neck. What will you be needing? The voice was louder. The stranger smiled. The plant you carry so close to your heart. The husband reached out the skilled hand he always used and picked up the special roots which made lips smack and eyes open. He picked a half dozen and laid them down on the smooth counter. The stranger shook their head. The shawl spun wildly. Their irises sparkled with knowledge. For the merchants husband was always one to lie. You have lied to me. The stranger purred. I am asking for the plant that you carry close to your heart. The merchants lips dipped downwards. She glanced at her husband. He returned the special roots to their basket. He next wrapped his fingers around an ear of corn. He lifted it and offered it to this peculiar customer. The corn was beautiful. The bland day could not reach the smooth bumps on the vegetable. It shone like the butter in the stall to the right of the merchant and her husband. It was very clean, and you might see a reflection on the yellow surface. The stranger was still not satisfied. They waggled their fingers in disapproval, and a grin showed yellow teeth. The stranger had come prepared for this trick. You have once again hidden the truth from me. What is closest to your heart, dear man? The merchant rose from her seat. She cupped her tanned hand and leaned down to advise her husband. He listened quietly and nodded. They exchanged a glance like crystals. The merchant fell back on her stool once more. Puffs of dirt rose from her skirts. The husband knitted his eyebrows and was now ready. I have not an idea what you speak of. The stranger threw back their oval head and laughed into the sky. You have lied three times, my dear. Once more, a- The folks who were in the area gasped and stumbled backward. The stranger was now lying on the ground, with a forehead of violet. The merchants husband shook out the hand which had been in a fist. Blood fell from his knuckles and dripped on the corn he had placed on the wooden counter. He did not bother to wipe it. It was of no value from this point forward. It would be cooked in a stew once the day fell. The merchant stood once more and embraced her husband. The perfect start to a day of profits."

It is about the mischievous adventures of an animatedmarionettenamedPinocchioand his father, a poorwoodcarvernamedGeppetto.It was originally published in aserialform as(Italian:) in the, one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. The story stopped after nearly 4 months and 8 episodes at Chapter 15, but by popular demand from readers, the episodes were resumed on 16 February 1882.In February 1883, the story was published in a single book. Since then, the spread ofon the main markets for children's books of the time has been continuous and uninterrupted, and it was met with enthusiastic reviews worldwide.A universal icon and ametaphorfor thehuman condition, the book is considered a canonical piece of children's literature and has had a great impact on world culture. PhilosopherBenedetto Crocereputed it as one of the greatest works ofItalian literature.Since its first publication, it has inspired hundreds of new editions, stage plays, merchandising, television series and movies, such asWalt Disney's iconicanimated version, and commonplace ideas such as a liar's long nose.According to extensive research done by thein the late 1990s and based onUNESCOsources, the book has been adapted in over 260 languages worldwide,while as of 2018 it has been translated into over 300 languages.That makes it themost translated non-religious bookin the worldand one of thebest-selling booksever published,with over 80 million copies sold in recent years(the total sales since its first publication are unknown because of the manypublic domainre-releases begun in 1940).According toFrancelia Butler, it remains ""the most translated Italian book and, after theBible, the most widely read"". The story begins inTuscany, Italy. Acarpenternamed Master Antonio, but whom everyone calls Master Cherry, has found a block of wood which he plans to carve into a leg for his table. When he begins, however, the log shouts out. Frightened by the talking log, Master Cherry gives it to his neighborGeppetto, an extremely poor man who plans to make a living as a puppeteer in hopes of earning ""a crust of bread and a glass of wine"". Pinocchiothrows a hammer at thetalking cricket.Geppetto carves the block into a boy and names him ""Pinocchio"". As soon as Pinocchio's nose has been carved, it begins to grow with his congenital impudence. Before he is even built, Pinocchio already has a mischievous attitude; no sooner than Geppetto is finished carving Pinocchio's feet does the puppet proceed to kick him. Once the puppet has been finished and Geppetto teaches him to walk, Pinocchio runs out the door and away into the town. He is caught by aCarabiniere, who assumes Pinocchio has been mistreated and imprisons by Geppetto.Left alone, Pinocchio heads back to Geppetto's house to get something to eat. Once he arrives at home, atalking cricketwho has lived in the house for over a century warns him of the perils of disobedience and hedonism. In retaliation, Pinocchio throws a hammer at the cricket, more accurately than he intended to, and accidentally kills it. Geppetto is released from prison and makes Pinocchio a new pair of feet.Pinocchio gets hungry and tries to fry an egg, but what comes out of it is a little bird that flies out the window forcing Pinocchio to leave the house to ask for food. Then he knocks on an old man's door to ask for food. The man thinking that Pinocchio was one of the hooligans who ring the bells for fun, and instead of giving a good piece of bread all he gets is a bucket of cold water on his head. Wet Pinocchio comes home and lies down on a stove, but the next day when he wakes up he falls to the ground with burned feet. Luckily, Geppetto is released from prison and makes Pinocchio a new pair of feet. In gratitude, he promises to attend school, and Geppetto sells his only coat to buy him a school book.   The puppet masterMangiafuocoOn his way to school the next morning, Pinocchio encounters the Great Marionette Theatre, and he sells his school book to buy a ticket for the show. During the performance, the puppetsHarlequin,Pulcinella,and Signora Rosaura on stage recognize him in the audience and call out to him, angering the puppet masterMangiafuoco. Upset, he breaks up the excitement and decides to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his lamb dinner. After Pinocchio pleads to be saved, Mangiafuoco gives in and decides to burn Harlequin. After Pinocchio pleads for Harlequin's salvation, Mangiafuoco gives up. When he learns about Pinocchio's poor father, he ultimately releases him and gives him five gold pieces to give to Geppetto.   As Pinocchio travels home to give the coins to his father, he meetsa fox and a cat. The Cat pretends to be blind, and the Fox pretends to be lame. A whiteblackbirdtries to warn Pinocchio of their lies, but the blackbird is eaten by the Cat. The two animals convince Pinocchio that if he plants his coins in the Field of Miracles outside the city ofCatchfools, they will grow into a tree with gold coins.They stop at the red lobster inn, where the Fox and the Cat gorge themselves on food at Pinocchio's expense and ask to be awoken by midnight. Two hours before the set time, the pair abandon Pinocchio, leaving him to pay for the meal with one of his coins. They instruct the innkeeper to tell Pinocchio that they left after receiving a message stating that the Cat's eldest kitten had fallen ill and that they would meet Pinocchio at the Field of Miracles in the morning.  The Fox and the Cat, dressed as bandits, hang Pinocchio.As Pinocchio sets off for Catchfools, the ghost of the Talking Cricket appears, telling him to go home and give the coins to his father. Pinocchio ignores his warnings again. As he passes through a forest, the Fox and Cat, disguised asbandits, jump out and ambush Pinocchio for robbing him. The puppet hides the coins in his mouth and escapes to a white house after biting off the Cat's paw. Upon knocking on the door, Pinocchio is greeted by a youngfairy with turquoise hairwho says she is dead and waiting for a hearse. Unfortunately, the bandits catch Pinocchio andhanghim in a tree. After a while, the Fox and Cat get tired of waiting for the puppet to suffocate, and they leave.

The third doctor is the Ghost of the Talking Cricket who says that the puppet is fine, but has been disobedient and hurt his father. The Fairy administers medicine to Pinocchio who consents to take it after fourundertakerrabbitsarrive to carry away his body. Recovered, Pinocchio lies to the Fairy when she asks what has happened to the gold coins, and his nose grows until it is so long that he cannot turn around in the room.

Upon being released by stating to the jailer that he committed a crime, Pinocchio leaves Catchfools.    Alidoro saves Pinocchio fromthe Green Fisherman.Upon arriving on the Island of Busy Bees, Pinocchio can only get food in return for labor. Pinocchio offers to carry a lady's jug home in return for food and water. When they get to the lady's house, Pinocchio recognizes the lady as the Fairy, now miraculously old enough to be his mother. She says she will act like his mother, and Pinocchio will begin going to school. She hints that if Pinocchio does well in school and tries his hardest to be good for one whole year, then he will become a real boy.Pinocchio studies hard and rises to the top of his class, but this makes the other schoolboys jealous. The other boys trick Pinocchio into playing hookey by saying they saw a largesea monsterat the beach, the same one that swallowed Geppetto. However, the boys were lying and a fight breaks out. One boy named Eugene is hit by Pinocchio's school book, though Pinocchio did not throw it. Pinocchio is accused of injuring Eugene by two Carabiniers, but the puppet escapes. During his escape, Pinocchio saves a drowning Mastiff named Alidoro. In exchange, Alidoro later saves Pinocchio fromThe Green Fisherman, who was going to eat the marionette as Pinocchio returns home. After meeting the Snail that works for the Fairy, Pinocchio is given another chance by the Fairy.  The wagon ofthe Coachmanthat leads the boys in theLand of ToysPinocchio does excellently in school and passes with high honors. The Fairy promises that Pinocchio will be a real boy the next day and says he should invite all his friends to a party. He goes to invite everyone, but he is sidetracked when he meets a boy nicknamedCandlewickwho is about to go to a place calledToylandwhere everyone plays all day and never works. Pinocchio goes along with him when they are taken there byThe Coachman, and they have a wonderful time for the next five months.   Pinocchio andCandlewickbecame donkeys.One morning in the fifth month, Pinocchio and Candlewick awake with donkeys' ears. ADormousetells Pinocchio that he has got a donkey fever: boys who do nothing but play and never study always turn into donkeys. Soon, both Pinocchio and Candlewick are fully transformed. Pinocchio is sold to a circus by The Coachman. He is trained by theringmasterto do tricks until he falls and sprains his leg. The ringmaster then sells Pinocchio to a man who wants to skin him and make a drum. The man throws the donkey into the sea to drown him. But when the man goes to retrieve the corpse, all he finds is a living marionette. Pinocchio explains that the fish ate all the donkey skin off him and he is now a puppet again.   Pinocchio finds Geppetto inside theDogfish.Pinocchio dives back into the water and swims out to sea. When the Terrible Dogfish appears, Pinocchio swims from it at the advice of the Fairy in the form of a little blue-furredgoatfrom atop a high rock but is swallowed by it. Inside the Dogfish, Pinocchio unexpectedly finds Geppetto, who has been living on a ship inside there. Pinocchio and Gepetto with the help of a tuna, a companion inside the Dogfish, who, following his example, managed to escape and took them on his back to the mainland. Pinocchio gave a kiss of thanks and left with his father in search of a place to stay.  Pinocchio recognizes the farmer's donkey as his friend Candlewick.Pinocchio and Geppetto encounter the Fox and the Cat who are now impoverished. The Cat has really become blind, and the Fox has really become lame and is also thin, almost hairless, and has chopped off his tail to sell for food. The Fox and the Cat plead for food or money, but Pinocchio rebuffs them and tells them that their misfortunes have served them right for their wickedness. Geppetto and Pinocchio arrive at a small house, which is home to the Talking Cricket. The Talking Cricket says they can stay and reveals that he got his house from a little goat with turquoise hair. Pinocchio gets a job doing work for Farmer Giangio and recognizes the farmer's dying donkey as his friend Candlewick.  Pinocchio becomes a real human boy.After long months of working for the farmer and supporting the ailing Geppetto, Pinocchio goes to town with the forty pennies he has saved to buy himself a new suit. He discovers that the Fairy is ill and needs money. Pinocchio instantly gives the Snail he met back on the Island of Busy Bees all the money he has.That night, he dreams that he is visited by the Fairy, who kisses him. When he wakes up, he is a real boy at last. His former puppet body lies lifeless on a chair. Furthermore, Pinocchio finds that the Fairy has left him a new suit, boots, and a bag in which he thinks are the forty pennies that he originally gave to her. Instead, the boy is shocked to find forty freshly-minted gold coins. Geppetto also returns to health."
The Heart of A Tiny Kitten,"Once upon there was a huge, huge cat with huge huge claws. Can you picture him? Scary looking isnt he? At least thats what the people around him thought of him. His purring sounded to them like an earthquake and his miaows like a roar that could make their organs shake in their bodies. No wonder people stayed as far away from this huge monster-like-looking creature as possible. Some big cats would be happy to be left alone, but not him. This big, big cat was still a tiny little kitten inside with tiny little kitten needs. He wanted nothing more than to be hugged, to be petted, and to lay his big head on a friendly humans lap. None of those things are easy to achieve when everyone runs away from you as far as they can, so one day the big, big cat with the tiny, tiny heart decided to go into the world to find people that were brave enough to love him. He searched the forests and fields, the deserts and beaches, he looked through windows and at some point even dragged his clumsy body up a lamppost to have a better view. No matter where his journey brought him, he never lost sight of his tiny hearts longing. The human voices never seemed far away, yet always out of reach. If only they could hear the beating of his tiny heart instead of just the loudness of his roars... Because the big, big cat with the tiny heart knew how scary he was to people, he also understood that just running up to them was not the solution if he wanted the people to feel safe around him. Thats why he decided to be very mindful by approaching any new group by waving at them from a distance. A great idea if you are anything but a huge, scary-looking cat. However, in his case, the people generously misperceived his kind intentions. What they saw was not a friendly waving cat, but a threatening-looking beast shaking its claws at them, threatening to tear them apart. As one might expect, they freaked out and did what humans always do when they feel irrationally frightened, they took out their guns and started shooting at this poor creature. This sweet, naive cat saw the people running after him while shooting their guns and thought:Wow, theyve finally come to me and they want to play!And so he started to run and jump around, he started to sneak up on them to give them playful yaps with his paws. As with everything in life, its all fun and games until somebody gets shot, and that was exactly what happened to the cat. He felt a sudden sting in his paw and got really scared. As fast as he could, he ran into the forest until he could find a place in the bushes to hide. Where before he did anything in his power to get closer to people, he now wanted nothing more than to get as far away from them as possible. Right at that moment, a girl was walking through the forest. She saw the bushes moving wildly by the heavy breathing of the cat. As she came closer to him and he spotted her, he used his growl to scare her away, since now the big, big cat with the tiny kitten inside had gotten afraid of people. He didnt see them as friends anymore but rather as dangerous creatures that were all out to hurt him. He growled and growled but the little girl didnt move an inch. She was not scared of him, oh no Why would she? Her father and mother were very mean to her every day. They were always shouting at her and occasionally they would hit her. What could this hairy creature possibly do to her that they hadnt done to her already? And so she came closer. When she had finally reached him, she saw this poor, trembling creature looking up at her with big eyes. The whole frightening-looking facade that people had been so afraid of was now reduced to nothing more than a ball of fear and fluff.Dont be afraid little kitty, Im here to help you, she said while petting his big head. She took his paw and looked at the big wound.That doesnt look good at all, little kitty. It seems like I will have to take you home to take care of this.When the big cat heard those words, his eyes widened with excitement. Would he finally be able to have human friends? To spend time with them and play with them? The excitement about this prospect gave him new energy and he followed the girl home, hopping playfully alongside her while occasionally rubbing his big head against her leg. As they neared the house of the little girl, her mother and father were sitting outside, waiting for the little girl with pure rage in their eyes. She started to worry. What if they would yell at her for bringing this gentle creature into their home? What if they would hurt her... or him? At that moment the big cat with the tiny kitten inside noticed the parents and he immediately got excited. Even more people to cuddle and share his home with! With great enthusiasm, he lifted his paw and started to wave wildly. So wild that the parents' eyes widened. All they knew in life was aggression and so they took the kindness of the cat for raging anger. Immediately they ran away as far as they could. From that day on the cat and the little girl lived together in the house where there was always a sweet harmony. She didnt have to worry ever again about someone yelling at her or beating her. And him? He could get all the cuddles he wanted and forever put his big paws around someone who would never ever be scared of him."
Only You,"It all began in Pirate elf street. The day before Christmas, I and my family travelled to Canada to see my mother's grandma. We boarded a plane tho.Ohhh i forgot! My name is Cee Jim and I'm sixteen years of age.I kinda believe in goblets, spells and magic. I am the only child of my parents. I am loved by everyone i know and came across. My favourite TV program is F.r.i.e.n.d.s and my favourite actress from the program is Jennifer Aniston also known as Rachel Green in the movie. I prefer cats to dogs, yeah yeah. I am done with college.Alllllllright peeps....Back to the story...my great grandma's house is A to the MA to the ZING- Amazing!!It was time for dinner. My mom served us, we gave thanks to God Almighty and focused on our meals. There was this cold stare that my great grandma gave me....more like I WILL POSSESS YOU stare.After the heavy meal, i headed up to my bedroom. Mehn! I was stuffed. I could not even breathe.I also could not touch my toes or maybe see my toes just like PO in KUNG FU PANDA...hahahaAs i opened the door of my bedroom, I felt something strange watching me.Could it be Santa Claus or maybe the weird old great grandmother of Cee Jim?I asked myselfI quickly entered my room and shut the door. I lay on my bed thinking about what I experienced right now. I tried my best to tell my mom but i couldn't move. There i was in my bed....FROZEN just like Anna of Arendelle in the movie, Frozen!! Fortunately enough for me, i slept off.....do not ask me how cause it felt magical.The Following day(Christmas), my dad woke me up so earlyyyyyyy. He told me to prepare for Church. I quickly took my shower. I was about putting on my clothes when i saw a strange ring on my bed. The ring was made of gold, shun like the morning sun and looked magical. Out of curiosity, i quickly put it on and it vanished leaving a mark 'C' on my pinky finger. I was shocked to my bones but still brushed it aside as nothing.As i headed downstairs to the living room, my great grandma held the same pinky finger and chanted:RingRingRing of powerGrant her wishesSo so soMote moteIt be.I nearly passed out as she said those words. I wanted to speak but i couldn't. I wanted to shout but i held something seizing my voice. I then knew that my great grandma had bewitched me. I couldn't reason well again.I cried out so loud but no one could hear me only the witch could. I wished her death and so it was. She was buried that day. Her last words were ONLY YOU. I was sad yet happy. I thought i was free.At the Church, a black mass was conducted. I said to myself......so G.granny was a witch.....because how can the Reverend conduct a black mass for her. I don't really know about G.granny's own culture but just a Black mass was conducted. During the mass, i heard voices screaming, some were echoing. I told my mom I was scared. She did nothing but held my hand tight. It seemed that G.granny's spirit was floating because I do not know what could make anyone that scared.That day, Christmas was horrible.Weeks passed by and none of my friends came close to me. They avoided because of whatever their reason might be. My mom also began to fear me cause sometimes i would either laugh or look like my late G.granny.My mom knew that my G.granny was a witch all along and she never cared to tell me. I was all alone in this hugeeeeeeee world of theirs.I was a living soul in the land of the dead or better still, a dead soul moving in the human world.I do not know the perfect word to but just know that i was just moving. It was as if i was being pushed. Something was pushing me. I could not stop marching to my doom...I was scared to death but none of these seemed to bother anyone.Once if i could remember, a lady in white called me and told me to break my finger to be free. I thought she was nuts so i didn't adhere to that. I could not even see her face. I just heard her melodious voice and knew that she was a female with a beautiful white gown. It seemed soo light, light like a feather or a piece of paper.The other time a butterfly whispered into my ears saying...BreakRingBE FREEI still did not listen. Like who listens to a butterfly or should I say a fly made of butterEven if i listened to it, how will i break my fingerWish for it? Nah.....bad idea.That would bring a curse on me and maybe my entire generation.Better i ignore the god damn warning.I tried my best to speak but no one cared to listen. I wanted to tell my mom but i scared of what she will do to me. You dare not tell my mom nonsense.Waking up everyday made no sense to me. I was tired, frustrated and worst of all...ANGRY.My dad was great but I could not just tell him. I feared for his safety. I was threat to my parents, not only my parents to my friends, relatives and everyone in pirate elf street.Was i a blessing or a curse, definitely a curse. How could i do this to myself. Why the hell did i put on the ring. I should have alerted my parents! Gosh i am so dooooomed for life.One dreadful night, i wished for the ring to take all my problems away. Suddenly everyone on Earth vanished(died) leaving only me behind.I was so happy till I heard a knock on my door....."
Fox,"Perhaps if all life was completely unable to tell a lie, we could learn to live with the truth.Alas, we can all easily mislead others from the truth, therefore leading us to be accustomed to using lies to benefit ourselves, often but not always hurting others on the path. Lies start out simple, and they spiral.If you are not careful, they boomerang back into your face and hurt . If you  careful, you can end up saving yourself from numerous amounts of troubles.You could lie and say your paw hurts and be excused from hunting. But if your father finds out, you would be doing the sole hunting for the next fortnight.Being a fox, all the other species are already used to our lying. They expect it, accept it. But amongst ourselves, its all a battle to a fresh set of eyes with the  truth, which is often lost in the stars.In the deeper parts of the forest, mysterious happenings are always at place. Rarely any foxes are found trotting about, lest we become part of the rumors. If you are a fox, you are suspicious, sly, secretive, unworthy of a second thought on your word. Of course, thats why I was always there. They respected me to some point, the other animals. They thought me to be the only noble fox, the truth-teller. What they did not know was that I was just the best of the liars.When the self-proclaimed gingerbread man came along into our neck of the forest, I was not too surprised.*At first, I was alarmed. All the animals who saw him were. He looked like a man. A , which in the forest, is not a welcome sight.There were things about him that were inherently  however.For one, he was very, very . His face was no bigger than my front paw and his whole body less than the length of my tail. Id never seen a human up close before, but from the stories Id heard, assuming them truthful, they were much larger. And something else, his skin was odd. I dont mean too dark or too light, rather it had a flaky look to it, like it would be easily breakable.Easily edible.Not only that, but his features looked strangely artificial. Beady black eyes and a completely white, an almost sewn-on smile.All the animals who happened to be there when he arrived assessed his appearance, our ears twitching and our stances softening when we saw that whatever he was, he wasnt human.Thats when he started running.His peculiar flat body miraculously balanced itself on two legs and ran with impeccable speed. His solid features twitched and for a moment, I stood, whips of wind blowing in the slightly chilly September breeze. Oslac, a rabbit, hesitated for a brief second before running after the thing. The other animals gathered slowly dissipated, leaving me standing alone.Of course, I had to follow.Oslac was fast, his hops high and long and he never seemed to grow tired. If I really tried, I could get ahead of both Oslac and the man-thing, but I decided to stay steadily beside the rabbit, my paws barely even hitting the ground as I ran.I could see the thing right up ahead, and just as I thought, small little flakes of his skin fell with each movement.My, my, what you? Oslacs nose twitched as he spoke and we turned through the forest, tree after tree passing by in a blur. The thing stopped, and so did we, dirt and dust flying into the air as we nearly all collided. The thing blinked, or at least it seemed that way, for his unnatural eyes seemed to thin for a second.He didnt appear to be breathing. In fact, he rarely seemed alive at all, if not for the fact that he was standing of his own accord.I am the gingerbread man. I could barely register his wink, one of his eyes thinning, before he turned on his heels and was off again. Oslac sprung forward, jumping once very high and continuing forward. My ears twitched and dirt flew into my face before I followed, paws slightly aching from all the running.You might be wondering what was so special about a , about this  that we should chase him, Oslac and I. Imagine if something strange were to walk into your home and promptly start running about.Youd be compelled to chase, would you not?A guilty man runs, is that not what they say?So we ran, the old spider watching us as we flew by, afraid wed ruin his newly made web.There are certain situations, like with twisting truth, you must sabotage an opponent to win a game. Tripping someone else may be the only way to gain your own balance.Metaphorically or literally.In this case, literally.I swung my tail around and tripped poor Oslac who fell flat on his twitching nose. At least, I assume. I didnt look back as I continued running after the gingerbread man, picking up speed and no longer being held back by the rabbit.You wont catch me! The thing spoke and laughed as it ran. It was absurd, I thought, that a thing so little could run so fast.I kept my eyes on his back of sorts as we ran, never once looking where we were going or the animals passing through. I had taken it upon me that I would catch him, if it cost me my life.Dull pain coursed through my thin muscles, my red fur lined with sweat.I didnt want to stop. I didnt want to lose sight of the thing, didnt want to  at all.As I was just losing hope, the thing stopped in front of me. I halted myself and panted, staring still at the back of his head.I darted my eyes around to see why hed stopped, and I couldnt help as a grin rose to my face when it fully dawned upon me. Up ahead was the river.Multiple animals of all different shapes and sizes were scattered about, drinking, gossiping, bathing.It was a thin river, thin enough that I could jump over it if I wanted to, and had done multiple times before. It was also shallow, shallow enough that I could float in it without worry of drowning. This little gingerbread man was far too small to jump, too thin to float.He turned, but before he could do anything else, I pounced.I pressed my paws on his flaky skin and pushed him into the soggy ground. He didnt struggle much, seeing as he obviously had no lungs, no need to breathe. As soon as I pinned him down, he tried to wiggle free. A small  froze him in his tracks. I saw a small line forming between his shoulder and arm, right where my paw sat.He was breaking.I was intrigued.The only things Id ever seen  were the nuts the birds and squirrels were always dropping down as they ate. Food.Curious, I leaned my muzzle down close to the thing, sniffing long and hard. His scent was interesting, unlike anything Id ever smelt ever before.He looked scared, strangely.What do you want, why are you here? I whispered straight at his face, exhaling my words so that he would only hear them.I am here to pass on a message to the- He coughed, which was strange for a thing that didnt breathe, and I just  released a bit of my hold so hed continue. To the king. The lion.At this, I re-pushed with all my strength, and another  was heard. He whimpered.This is the forest, not the jungle.He blinked multiple times at me, weird eyes thinning and thickening again and again.O-Of course. What I meant was-I pushed my paw on his mouth, muffling his words.Are you here to hurt the forest?His eyes grew cold, more lifeless than they had been before. I moved my left paw to let him speak.You and your species and the whole forest have already damaged the forest. Im here to repair it.He had stopped struggling by then, just a thing sitting still under my paws.Something about the little circles going down his body, something about them shone like...a delicious mealworm, ready to be eaten.I couldnt help myself and stuck my tongue out just to take a small taste of the thing.He tasted sweet, unnatural. He didnt belong in the forest.You need to cross this river?He nodded hesitantly.I shall help you then, if youll only just climb on my back.The coldness disappeared from his eyes and he seemed to smile. I loosened my hold and he climbed onto my back, clinging onto my fur.All the other animals, I knew, would think I ate him. Im a fox, after all, thats all we seem to do- eat, lie, cheat.I was not completely without morals, however. I would not eat a living thing while it sat living in front of me, after I lied straight to their face.No.I flipped over on my back once I jumped into the river, and the gingerbread man fell, falling into the waves, unable to scream for help.I drowned him, where no one would catch him ever again."
Once Upon a Time,"One day I was chatting to the old guy who lives in the garden apartment below. Interesting. It turned out that he has two brothers who were authors of fairy tales. Were their stories published? I asked.Sure! he said. And how! Their best stories made them rich. I never got any of it. I am the little piggy who got none. He laughed. Like in the nursery rhyme, I said.Exactly!Tell me about one of their fairy tales, I asked. I will. But Ill make coffee first, he said. By the way my name is Elias, he said as he went into the kitchen.And Im Pete! I called, being friendly.  Their most famous tale was about the little girl who was kept locked up in a tower with a spinning wheel that spun straw into gold. So every day they went out and gathered straw, took it to the castle and she spun it into gold. And every morning they swept up yesterdays gold production, took it downtown and sold it to a jewelry maker. Boy did they make money! They were filthy rich! One drove a Ferrari, the other an Aston Martin. Big playboys around town. Gambling, horses, women, all that rich mans stuff, you know. Are they still in business? I askedNah. All good things come to an end, sonny. Especially when its that good.What happened? I asked. The little girl died?Nope. Nothing so dramatic. The price of gold dropped. They were producing so much that it affected the price. Eventually, it hardly paid them to sell the stuff. I have some somewhere. Next time you come Ill give you a bucketful. Just remind me. My memory, you know. So what are they doing now? I asked.They are trying to melt the stuff and make coins out of it. But its not so easy. Why not? Should be a piece of cake!It seems you have to get government approval, then register it and get another approval from the World Bank. Theres all sorts of red tape to prevent private people from making their own money and flooding the world with worthless currency. The boys are working on it. Its hard to know what to do with a daily production of gold. There are conmen and thieves on every corner. Everyone wants to get hold of gold. Even I cant get in on their act.  What a fascinating story, I thought, drinking my coffee. Back in my apartment I wondered if I should drop all work on my book and write articles. The first one would be about my neighbors brothers, the money-makers. Im sure the papers would buy it. I could use the dollars Being an author is some challenge! Time passed and I greeted the old man every time I saw him. I was working on my book and having a rough time with it, so I spent most of my days hunched over the computer and muttering away to myself. I went out only when it was absolutely necessary. One day I walked past the old mans balcony on my way back from a trip to the bakery and deli. Bought some great sheeps-milk cheese. I had also dropped in at the bank to cash a $100 check I had received from the Mirror that morning. They had finally bought my article on deadly plagues. The bank, of course, was closed. It always is when you need it.  Aha! Ive been waiting to see you, old Elias called as he spotted me. I waved.Theres news! he shouted. My brothers made it! They got all the necessaries to go ahead with their new money! That stopped me in my tracks. Great! I said. Where can one get it?You have to look for it. They are advertising it on the internet.The internet? Whats it called?Bitcoin, He replied. Theres only a single-value coin. You can buy as many as you want.What can I do with them?I really dont know. I forgot to ask. Just buy them and throw them in a drawer. One day they may be worth something. Maybe youll double your money, haha!  I stared at him. He forgot to ask?I only know one thing about them, he said.Whats that?My brothers will make more millions. Zillions, maybe. Those guys never miss.Amazing! I ventured. Are these your older or younger brothers?Younger. Much younger. I am 88 and they are 68. Twins. Go everywhere together. Dress the same. Look the same. Think the same. Chase the same women. Sometimes I think it must be pretty boring. How many Bitcoins are you planning to buy?Um, havent actually thought about it yet. On a whim and wanting to hear more about his brothers, I said, Come up and have coffee at my place. I make good coffee and I just bought some great cheese.Thank you, I will be up in a few minutes.Seated at the table with cups of coffee in front of us and plates piled high with slices of rough peasants bread and a steadily diminishing block of cheese, I asked, so what do these Bitcoins cost?One dollar each.Wow, thats cheap!  And then I had a rush of blood to my head via the $100 check in my pocket. Ill take a hundred! I announced grandly.Good man! he exclaimed. I love it when people support my brothers. Tell you what, I have a few here. Im giving these to you. No charge. A gift, neighbor to neighbor. Okay? Thats very nice of you. I appreciate the gesture. Have some more cheese.I cannot. Thank you. I must go now.He had given me 18 coins. I cashed the check next morning and bought the 100 Bitcoins. I now had 118 taking up space in the drawer with my socks.  Its now exactly 10 years later. I open the morning paper to look at the price of Bitcoins. These days I look twice a day. A little short of $60,000 each. By noon today I will have 7 million bucks in the bank. And old man Elias, somewhere up in the clouds above my head, must be laughing his head off.  Me? I plan to live happily ever after."
Crystal Teardrops,"Stacy lined the tree with shiny crystal teardrops she took from the back of her grandmothers lamp.She was hoping she wouldn't miss them.Her garden was almost complete.She had houses where they could live, swings, and teeter-totters for them to play.Stacy had been building her fairy garden for over a year.Her collection started with her grandmother buying her the first house.Not long afterward, everyone brought her accessories to go with her village. The family realized that the trinkets kept the little girl entertained and helped with her loneliness.She was an only child who lived in the country, and her neighbors were few.Stacy went inside to ask her mother if she could have a picnic under the tree in her fairy garden.Her mother assured her it would be fine.Stacy asks for milk, honey, and some whipped cream.Her mother told her that it was a strange lunch and asked her if she wouldn't prefer a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.Stacy accepted the sandwich but asked if her mother could provide the other food also.Stacy's mother told her she would give her a glass of milk, but the honey and whipped cream would have to come another time.Stacy was disappointed but decided to lure a fairy to her garden with only milk and the shiny teardrops she had placed.She climbed up in the tree with her sandwich and waited to see if any fairy took the bait.Stacy sat quietly and ate her lunch.She soon realized she needed the milk with the sticky sandwich. After twenty minutes, the five-year-old climbed down the tree and took a large drink of milk to free her gums of the peanut butter.The fairies were not going to come today and she went inside.Stacy went to her room and picked up the fairy book she had borrowed from the library.Tomorrow she would have to find a way to get her mother to give her some honey and whipped cream.That is what fairies like to eat.Stacy had already convinced her mother to let her plant flowers around her garden.The sweet smell of foxglove was one of the flowers the fairies liked.The fairies would make a home in the bell of the flower and gather their pixie dust. Pixie dust was one of the magical powers the fairies possessed, and they also had control over some of the elements, wind, fire, and water.Stacy made sure when she was asking the fairy to come that she only asked for good fairies.She read in her book that there were also evil fairies.Stacy didn't want any of them living in her garden.The fairy she was seeking would be a friend, a playmate, and someone she would love.Stacy read all of the folklore in her book that was more advanced for her five years. She was determined to attract a fairy.The morning came, and Stacy got up early to return to her garden.She caught her mother distracted and on the phone with her grandmother. Stacy opened the jar of honey and put some in a plastic bag along with the whipped cream.Her mother came to the kitchen and asked her what she would like for breakfast, and she chose cereal. She needed the milk to complete her fairy trap.With the baggie stuck firmly in her pocket, Stacy went outside to her village.The wind was blowing a warm breeze that felt good on her face when she entered.Stacy found one of the teardrops lying on the ground and thought the wind must have blown it down. The crystal was lying beside a small trinket that looked like a green glass rock.She wondered if the fairies had visited after she went inside.Stacy was excited to tell her mother.She ran inside and found that she was still on the phone with her grandmother.Her mother told her it was pretty and maybe her cat had drug it in.Stacy knew it was from the fairies, and she needed to figure out a way to make contact.The book also mentioned the fairies liked beautiful music.Stacy looked through the house for the radio and had to settle for her cassette player that played children's nursery rhymes.She was outside in her garden for several hours while waiting for the fairies to visit until her mother called her in for dinner.Stacy would have to start fresh in the morning. After dinner, she would study her book again to see if there was anything she was missing.Stacy's mom and dad talked to her at dinner and asked her if she had an exciting day.She told them about the trinket the fairy left and that she was getting close to making them appear.Her father smiled and told her he loved her imagination.Stacy's mom tucked her in bed and kissed her goodnight.As soon as the light went off and her mother left the room, Stacy turned on her flashlight and started reading her book.She had hung shiny things and gave them milk, cream, and honey. Stacy played music and planted beautiful foxglove flowers that smelled heavenly.She was kind and generous to all animals and loved her cat.She didn't know what was missing.At eight, Stacy woke up.After breakfast, she slipped out more cream, milk, and honey.Stacy gathered up her cassette player to take with her.Her mother told her it was supposed to be a hot day and to make sure she drank plenty of water.Stacy continued walking fast while not paying attention to what her mother said. She was excited to see if the fairies had visited and left her another trinket.Stacy looked everywhere in her village for anything out of place without success.She was sure that the fairies had been there before, and it wasn't her cat, Sebastian, that had brought her the green rock.Stacy was disappointed and started to doubt the existence of fairies when her mother called to her.""Stacy, she said, "" it is very hot, and if you want to continue to play outside, you must drink this bottle of water.Stacy grudgingly went to the house and took the water.She was busy and didn't want to be disturbed.Sebastian jumped into her fairy garden after her return and knocked over the houses. She was upset until she noticed him pawing at her bottle of water.He was thirsty too.Stacy took her fairy garden pond and poured Sebastian some water.The crystals above her head in the trees started to jingle and sparkle the colors of the prism. A warm breeze blew as the fairies came into the garden.Stacy had accomplished her wish to become friends with the fairies by offering them gifts and showing her compassion for animals when she put her cat, Sabastian's, needs above her own."
Little Billy and the Bluebird,"Little Billy lived in a small village in rural Scotland with his family. Little Billys father owned two acres of farmland on which the family cultivated barley, wheat and potatoes.Little Billys mother gathered wood, cooked food, washed clothes and cleaned the house each day.Little Billy and his younger sister, Sally, went to school and helped their mother and father.One day, Little Billys father fell sick. He called Little Billy to his bedside.Billy, my boy, I need you to go to town tomorrow. Can you do that? he said.Little Billy jumped at the idea for he  wanted to watch the circus show in town.Yes, Father, he said.I need you to buy some seeds and fertilizer for our farm.With these words, Little Billys father asked him to fetch his black pouch from the cupboard, from which he extracted ten pounds and gave them to the boy.Early next morning, Little Billys mother packed some oatcakes and bread for him to eat during the day. She also packed some cheddar cheese and a little bottle of wine for Little Billys grandmother, whose house was on the way to town.When Little Billy was ready to go, his younger sister brought a handful of pennies, all her savings in the world, and gave them to her brother.Billy, wont you buy a doll for me? I really  want a doll, she cried.Of course, Sally. Ill buy a doll for you.Little Billy waved to his mother and sister and set off towards the town at eight oclock in the morning.At a little distance from the house, Little Billy sat under the shade of a tree and unwrapped the block of cheddar cheese his mother had so carefully packed for his grandmother. Little Billy closed his eyes and smelled the cheese. Ah, what heavenly delight! He loved cheddar and the familys only cow produced little milk, with which his mother prepared the cheese, most of which was sold in the village. Little Billy and his family only got to eat a little bit of cheese just once a month.Little Billy opened his mouth wide and took a bite of the cheese. He caressed the cheese with his tongue and smothered it with his palate, savouring the rich, textured taste. Very soon, he took another bite and another. He gobbled up the bread and the oatcakes and washed them down with the little bottle of wine.What are you doing?A high-pitched voice sounded from the branches of the tree directly above him.Little Billy jumped. Whos there?A little bluebird fluttered in the branches above, her little head bowed down to look at Little Billy. You ate the food your mother packed for your grandmother. How could you do that?I was hungry, Little Billy said defiantly.Will you tell your mother the truth? said the bluebird.Of course not! cried Little Billy, now angry. He picked up a stone and hurled it at the bluebird.The bird hovered in the air, breaking into a song.As Little Billy picked up another stone, the bird flew away, its song ringing in Little Billys ear. He burped loudly and set off on his journey again.When Little Billy neared his grandmothers house, it was nearly noon. He slapped some dirt on his face and clothes and knocked on his grandmothers door.Little Billys grandmother was a frail, old woman who could hardly see.My dear, she cried on seeing her grandson. What happened to you? Are you hurt?Little Billy wrapped his arms around his grandmothers round, cushiony waist. Im so scared, granny. Im so scared, he shrieked.Whats the matter, my dear?Little Billys grandmother ushered him to a chair and made some hot chocolate for him, which he drank in one large gulp.Some bad men attacked me, granny, he whined. They slapped me and kicked me and stole from me.How awful! My poor dear, said his grandmother.They took all my food and the cheddar cheese and the bottle of wine that Mother had sent for you. They even stole my ten pounds! Oh, what will I say to Father! He will be so disappointed. I lost all his hard-earned money.Little Billy buried his head in his grandmothers lap and began to cry.Little Billys grandmother waddled over to her tiny cupboard and collected all the notes and coins in her silver box. Eight pounds and fifty pence.With the money in his pocket and a two-egg omelette in his bulging stomach, Little Billy set out on his journey once again, smiling inwardly.When he reached the town, Little Billy went straight to the circus and bought a ticket for five pounds. For another five pounds, Little Billy rode Eli, the elephant, for ten minutes. From the circus, Little Billy went straight to the spring fair, where he spent his remaining money on various rides.When he was exhausted and hungry, Little Billy hung outside a small coffee shop, eyeing a family at a table there. Little Billy noticed that the nice family eating sandwiches in the coffee shop seemed to be well off. The mother was carrying a smart purse and the father wore a stylish hat. Their daughter wore a pretty pink dress with a satin bow around her waist.Little Billy filled his eyes with tears and tapped at the glass window of the coffee shop.The mother saw him and couldnt look away. She invited Little Billy to join them for a snack.Little Billy hogged on the plate of sandwiches, thanking the family profusely for their immense kindness.Once the plates were taken away, the man asked Little Billy where he lived.I live in the village, Sir, with my grandmother, Little Billy said timorously.Just your grandmother? the woman asked.Yes, Maam, Little Billy answered. My parents died when I was very young. Since then, I live with my grandmother in our little house on our small farm. Shes a  mean old woman. When she finds out I lost the money she gave me to buy the seeds, she will be furious. I think she might break my leg today.With these words, Little Billy dropped his head on the table and began sobbing.The woman placed her hand kindly over his head. Do not cry, boy. We will help you. Wont we, my dear? she said, looking at her husband.The man pulled out his wallet from his pocket and gave Little Billy ten pounds.Thanking the family for their kindness, Little Billy left the coffee shop and went straight to the market, where he bought the seeds and fertilizer his father had asked him to buy. He saw the dolls at a shop but decided to buy himself ice cream and chocolates with the money his little sister gave him. Little Billys pockets were once again empty.On the way out of town, Little Billy saw a blind beggar seated by the side of the road, singing a tuneless song. Little Billy sat down beside the beggar, glancing at his bowl that held several coins and a few notes.Sir, may I sit here for a while? I beg on the other side of town, but some goons stole my money and drove me away, said Little Billy.Who are you, boy? said the old beggar.Im blind, Sir.Since birth? asked the beggar.No, Sir. I was born healthy with fine eyesight. One day, as we were sleeping at home, a fire broke out. My little sister died in the fire. I was burned too, but I survived. I lost my eyesight, Sir, said Little Billy.Yes, you may sit here with me, said the old beggar, patting Little Billys arm.As the old beggar talked about his life and how he lost his eyesight, Little Billy reached out for the bowl, emptied it into his pocket and returned the empty bowl to its position. While the old beggar continued talking, Little Billy quietly slipped away, laughing silently.Little Billy set off towards his village with three pounds and eighty pence in his pocket and half a sandwich that he had saved from the coffee shop.It was nearly evening when Little Billy stopped for a short break. He sat down under a tree to eat his sandwich and decide how he would spend the money he stole from the beggar.Overhead, he heard the fluttering of a bird and looked up.The bluebird was on the tree. It broke into a song:Little Billy quickly grabbed a stone and hurled it at the bird, but it flew away.Humph! exclaimed Little Billy. Ill kill that bird if I see it again.Little Billy continued his journey towards home. It was getting dark and there were no milestones, but Little Billy was quite sure he had passed the place where his grandmothers house used to be. But now, there was nothing there! Just a tree and nothing else. How strange, thought Little Billy as he headed home.When Little Billy approached his house, the moon was in the sky. Little Billy was shocked to see that instead of his fathers two-acre farmland now stood a small, barren farmland, barely one-tenth in size. His familys large brick house was replaced by a small hut with a thatched roof!Shakily, Little Billy knocked on the door, his heart hammering in his chest. The bluebirds song kept ringing in his ears. It was impossible! No!The door was opened by his grandmother, who stood straight, could see without her glasses and wore a mean expression on her hard face.Youre late, you brat! she bellowed, slapping Little Billy across his face.Little Billy fell on the floor and rubbed his eyes. He couldnt see very clearly. Everything was becoming blurry.Where are Mother and Father? cried Little Billy.Little Billys grandmother broke into high-pitched, evil laughter. Your mother and father are dead, you stupid boy! Dont you remember, you fool?Little Billy started crying. He could hardly see anything. And... and Sally, my little sister? he whimpered.Little Billys grandmother grabbed him roughly by his shirt and dragged him to a small mirror on the wall.Sally died in the fire that turned you into an ugly freak, said Little Billys grandmother.Little Billy saw his face and body, his skin shrunk and crumpled, brown and uneven, reflected in the mirror.He shrank in horror from the monster staring back at him from the mirror and fell to the floor. As his world went pitch-black, Little Billy heard his grandmothers voice from somewhere behind him.Get to work, you ! And if you mess things up again, I swear today, Ill break your leg!"

Kalerella a real Cinderella Story,"And there it was, a feeling as if there was no identity. No gender, no real weight, no form, but feelings. I want to go tonight, mom, it could mean a chance to be discovered. OK, I am tired of hearing about this ball, really. Come here I will get you ready. Kal's mom picks up a gentle cloth, soap, and water and hands it to Kal. It's just you see the world so differently, I am afraid your feelings will be hurt by others. Mom, these scarves look absolutely beautiful and these glass slippers, um a little redundant don't you think. Don't shatter them keep them on, nobody will know even though your feet don't fit in them. But aren't I made of... Shhh, you are just like everyone else, that is if you want to be. I am just a reflection of everyone else. Kal, you must be very special, you are every color and every reflection. You are everyone and everything only better.With the right light, you can glimmer like the sun...a little blush? I will wear this pink scarf and it will reflect off of my complexion, ok. No make-up, I am one big reflection. No smelly horses for you, I will drive you over, but you need to finish getting ready. What about this bag? It is translucent. Mom, aren't I translucent enough? You are whoever and whatever you want to be. Mom, do you ever say anthing negative? No, I am lucky to have you. Come on, lets you get there so you dont miss it. She is breathtaking a woman in the crowd yelled. And those scarves, pink and green! No he is thoroughly dapper another bystander called out.The prince was mezmorized, as Kal stood in the reflection of the sun. I can barely look at her, she is the sun. Kal smiled and slowly moved toward the prince. My name is Kal, short for Kalideoscope. The prince could barely speak as Kal and he danced throughout the evening. The glass slippers were so uncomfortable and Kal could barely bear to stand, never mind dance. Kal felt the strong arms of the prince holding and lifting the glass slippers off the floor. Ah, relief at last and then they were in the garden. You smell just like flowers and you are the flowers. I am, whispered Kal. But who are you?, said the Prince. I am everyone and no one, as my mom tells me. You have lovely colors and shapes within you, geometricly formed so sharply. Well, I do try to be edgy, considering. The prince fogged up the ridges of Kals scope and said I must see you again. My car will be waiting for me, I do have to leave at midnight. But as all fairy tales must, this one has the chimes ringing loudly at midnight. OK, I have to run, call me? Just leave me your glass slipper, I will find you. A strange one, Kal thought---um, ok. Walking wobbly Kal decided it was time to dispense with the second shoe and put it in her backpack. Mom it was incredible. I danced with the prince and he said if I left my glass slippers he would find me. I thought it was weird, but did it. I hope you are not mad. After all, I did bring the other one back. What did the prince say? He said I am the sun, but I couldnt help it, there was so much glare when I walked int the room. Mom laughing, Kal, you are the sun, the moon and the stars. Oh mom! Literally, you are everything because you are made of crystals. Crystals? Mom, I thought I was made of glass? You know, Kal get me a glass of water the kids always tease me. Kal let me put my make-up on I like to look at your arm. But, you are the reflection of the beauty of the world, if you choose to stand in it. If you reflect the ugliness, you will become ugly. The Prince, saw the sun in my eyes and he thought, just like Juliet, I was the sun. Kal, you are enchanted, when you were a baby, I found you in a basket by my door. I raised you as my own and you are just beautiful in my eyes. Mom, thank you, sometimes I need a pat on the back. Well, not too hard of a pat, after all, I might break you. Um, I pretty much think that that cant happen, I am broken in some places anyway. Oh Kal..someone is at the door. Do you think it might be the Prince? Chances are, it is utilities, I forgot to pay our bill. Mom!, said Kal reaching for the door knob and finding trouble turning it. Its the utility company here to collect the check or shut off the lights. Great, here is my checkbook and thank you for coming out, I just forgot. Kal glances down and sees a box from Zappos. Kal quickly opened up the box to find the dainty glass slipper. If you are the owner of this shoe, please call the Prince at 999-5555 My shoe? I thought he was supposed to ask for water and bring the shoe himself. Short cuts for everything these days. Good thing he didnt Kal, we dont have electricity right now. Hopefully in about an hour though. Mom, let me get the other one. Kal tried on the shoe and snapped a selfie..he sent it off to the Prince. As fairy tales go, a Prince drives up in a Tesla and comes closer to the cottage. Kal or we might call her Kalerella quickly lights some candles and gets some ashes on her face. Kal, let me dust that off of you before the Prince gets the wrong idea. Oh Mom, you take great care of me. A knock at the door, a Prince holding a thermos and says, mind if I ask you for some filtered water? Oh sure, I will get it for you, said Mom as she rushed to get the pitcher in the refrigerator. Johnson, my driver, is waiting for us outside...if the shoe fits. Say you look a little different than before. It must be that we are in the dark, remember you said I was the sun. But there is no sun here, only candlelight. Ah yes, but the shoes, do they fit? Here they slide in easily, I will show you. Sliding on the shoes and lights up like the chrystal that makes Kal shine. It is you my dear, would you lke to go the Kingdom and meet my mother and father? Why yes, of course? As Kal went outside and stood in the light, the Prince exclaimed, Kal you are the sun. To be honest, sometimes I am the sun, othertimes the moon, but I am always Kal. How about we go out on a date and we find out the important things that make us tick. Tick? Yes I love clocks. Lets go! Mom, I will see you later on, it seems that it will be quite a day. Text me when you are on the way home. The door closed, the lights went on and mom blew out all the candles and smiled. My child, the sun, the moon and the stars is dating a Prince, all things are possible."
The Spinner of Golden Tales,"Aedna sputters to the surface, blindly thrashing her legs and arms. The Pinkietoads leap from their lily pads, diving underwater, watching in wide-eyed wonder at the strange creature flailing in their pond.At last, Aedna opens her eyes. The pond is ringed by trees, but not the kind of trees she knows. The silvery bark sparkles in the sunshine, and the purple leaves whistle in the breeze as she swims awkwardly toward shore, finally standing when her feet find the muddy bottom.Two grey-ish green trolls, out for their afternoon stroll, gawp with open mouths, their sharp teeth glinting.What sort of creature is that? Borrarorr asks his wife.I think it may be a human child, Klaradair replies.But humans cant cross over to this realm.It did. Its here.Aaahhhhh! Aedna screams, on seeing the trolls.Aaahhhhh! the trolls reply in greeting.Am I dreaming? You cant be real.Pinch yourself and see, says Klaradair.Ouch!Whats your name, human child?AAedna. Where am I? Who are you? Whats going on?I am Klaradair, Klaradair says, then points to her husband, and this is Borrarorr. Youre in the Queendom of Faerfolk. As for how you got here, or why, we dont know.The last thing I remember, I was walking in the forest. Aedna says, wringing some water from her long dark hair. Id fought with my Mom, and kinda stormed off into the woods. I saw a beautiful blue butterfly and followed it deeper into the forest. And then I got really sleepy, so I slept on a bed of pine needles. And when I wake up, Im nearly drowning in that pond.You must be here for a reason, and we must find that reason, otherwise the Queen will have your eyes, says Borrarorr.My eyes? What for?Human eyes, emerald eyes, such as yours, would be a treasure beyond measure, Borrarorr says, as Klaradair nods in agreement.How do I find out the reason why Im here?First we must determine, what useful skills you have,"" Klaradair asks.Skills? I'm eleven. I don't have skills, like grown-ups do.Can you spin flax into gold? Borrarorr offers.Whats flax?Can you play the lyre, or harp, or Klaradair asks.No. I don't even sing very well.The trolls frown. Thats too bad. Were looking for a singer for our jazz band, Borrarorr says.A raven lands on a nearby log. Good afternoon, Poe, say the trolls. Poe nods and pronounces:Caw!The Queen approaches on the roadTo gather Pinkie- and MurktoadsThe green-eyed girl from humankindIf she dallies, shell soon be blindCaw!If we stay here, Queen Thalia will find her and pluck out her pretty eyes, Klaradair says.If we take her home and the Queen finds out, shell make a crown from our teeth, says Borrarorr.Then we cant let the Queen find out. Klaradair says, beckoning Aedna to follow them into the forest.**After an hour they reach a small hut with a thatched roof. Borrarorr stokes the fire on the hearth as Klaradair pours hearty broth into bowls and sets them on the rough wooden table.You can have Baggas room, says Klaradair. Thats our son. Hes a drummer, on tour with Tubadoors until winter.Ithank you, Aedna says, sipping the broth. You said everyone must have a reason, to be here. Whats yours?Well, we used to collect tolls at the bridge, says Borrarorr. But we werent making enough gold for a sufficient tribute to Queen Thalia. So we started playing music, and now Faerfolk travel far and wide to hear us play.So, every creature has a job. And they have to give their money to the Queen?We must all pay tribute, yes. From the Murktoads to the Nightvales, from the Pinkietoads to the Muse-Ravens, from the Bridge Trolls to Shadowgales, each and every inhabitant of Faerfolk Queendom must contribute, Borrarorr says.If they dont, he continues, the Queen extracts the things that make each creature beautiful and unique. Shes scraped the shimmering scales from the Pinkietoads, and bottled the deep brown eyes of the Murktoads.Snipped the gossamer wings of the Nightvales. Klaradair adds, Stolen sorrowful songs from the Shadowgales, and... she says, glancing at Poe whos perched on the windowsill, ripped the rhymes from the Muse-Ravens.Thats terrible! Why dont the Faerfolk refuse to do what she says? Aedna asks.Shes too powerful. Her magic has only grown stronger, and she can pay for a large army to protect her, Borrarorr says.""There must be something the creatures could do,"" Aedna says, trying to stifle a yawn.Youve had a long day, child. Why dont you rest, now, Klairadair says, leading her to a cosy bedroom.Aedna falls into a deep yet restless sleep. Black wraiths chase her through the forest, she stumbles and falls in the dark. Gets back up and falls again. The wraiths get closer and closer until they encircle her. An elvish Queen approaches. Shes beautiful in a cruel way, like a solitaire diamond, all edges and angles, her pale face reflecting in a never-ending hall of mirrors.She brandishes a silver spoon, the edge razor sharp, as she glides toward Aedna. Ill have your emerald eyes-s-s-s, little one, she hisses. so pretty, Ill scoop them with my silver spoon. And make some lovely earrings-s-s. The wraiths hold her down as the Queen nears. The cold sharp edge of spoon slices intoNooooo! Aenda screams, waking in the unfamiliar room, covered in sweat and breathing fast.Klairadair bursts through the door, a small candle in her hand. She sets it on the side table and sits on the edge of the bed. Whats wrong?I, uh, I had a bad dream I guess. The Queen was chasing me. AndAnd what?I miss my Mom.Im sure she's missing you too, terribly. Well find a way to get you back.**In the morning, as they sit round the table, drinking a woody-scented tea, Borrarror says, We dont have much time. The Queen has spies everywhere. If she doesnt already know about you, she soon will.She knows about her, Klaradair says, the Queen chased Aedna in her dream, just last night.Borrarror and Klaradair exchange worried looks.So, we must find your talent today, Borrarorr says.I, Im not talented in any way, says Aedna, staring into her mug of tea, Im ordinary. Maybe less than ordinary, if thats a thing.Everyone has some talent, Borrarorr says. Sometimes it takes a while to discover it, but you have it already. We just have to find it.What have people told you that youre good at? Klairadair asks.UhIm good at daydreaming, and sloppy handwriting, Aedna says, according to my teachers. Im good at not listening and being wilful and stubborn, according to my Mom.Hmmm, not sure how we can make those into something people would pay for says Klairadair. There must be something else you excel at. Think hard. Someone must have praised you for something?My Grandma says Ive got an active imagination, the way I make up stories from thin air. Does that count?Yesyes. You could spin fantastic stories.Okay. I think I remember some fairy tales, like Hansel and Gretel.What are fairy tales? asks Borrarorr.Theyre uh, stories about magical lands and creatures. And people getting into trouble, and then finding a way to get out of trouble. And then living happily ever after.Sounds like nonsense to me, but it might work, he says. But youll need to tell the Queen a tale that really impresses her.What does she like?Gold. And more gold. And ways to get more gold.Okay, so shes greedy. I know plenty of stories about that, Aedna says. If the Queen likes my story, will she return me to my Mom?The Queen has the power to do so, Klairadair says, but if she thinks she can spin gold from your stories, then theres not much motivation for her to let you go.Their conversation is interrupted by Poe, who lands on the windowsill and says,Caw!The Queen pursues, arriving soonWith her ogres and sharpened spoonSpin your tales to earn the goldOr lose your eyes and here grow oldCaw!**The Queen arrives in a gold carriage bedecked with jewels and pulled by seven strong, sweaty ogres. Her silver skin shimmers in the sunlight. Atop her fine platinum hair sits a golden crown, embedded with the sharp teeth of trolls and the sorrowful eyes of Murktoads. Borrarorr and Klairadair shiver, despite the warm sunshine.Trolls-s-s, she says, Are you hiding a treasure here? You know the punishment for that.No, your highness. We are keeping the human safe, so that you may hear her wondrous stories,  Borrarorr says, bowing deeply.Stories-s-s you say? They better be worth their weight in gold, or Ill have those emerald eyes-s-s for my crown.Oh, its a doozy of a story, Aedna says, swallowing hard.Chair! the Queen shouts. One ogre gets down on all fours while a second covers him in a plush carpet. Backrest she says. The second ogre drapes a carpet over his head and stands next the first. The Queen sits on one ogre, leaning her back against the other.You may begin your story, the Queens says. No wait. Ogre, bring me my silver eye-plucker. A third ogre retrieves the silver spoon from the carriage and gives it to her. The Queen nods toward Aedna.Aedna begins, Ah, once upon a time, in the land of the humans, there was an ugly duckling. The duckling was so ugly that its parents could not bear to look upon itBorrring, The Queen says, yawning.Aedna looks at the trolls, who nod encouragingly.But one day the duckling happened upon a witch in the woods, Aedna continues, And the witch took pity on the duckling and granted him a single wish. The duckling thought for a long time about what he should to wish for. Finally he said, I wish to be wanted by everyone.""And, uh, Aedna trails off for a second as the Queen sharpens the spoon against the fourth ogres teeth. Then, then the witch waved her bony hands and chanted something. And whoosh! The duck turned into something beautiful. He became a goose, a girl goose who could lay eggs. But not just any eggsThis goose could lay golden eggs.The Queen leans toward Aedna, her pointed ears twitching.And people came from far and wide to see the Goose who lays the Golden Eggs. And the Goose was very popular. All the cute boy gooses, er, geese, asked her to dance. The other girl geese were very jealous.Where is this Golden Goose now? You must take me to it at once, the Queen says, standing and striding toward Aedna.Ah, well, the Golden Goose is, uh, its a storyAn amazing true story, Klairadair interrupts, staring meaningfully at Aedna.Uh, yeah, sure. A true story. And the goose is, is my friend. We hang out sometimes, because, she likes to hear my stories. And she gives me eggs. So, I have like, loads of eggs in my room. And Mom is like, Aedna, you have too many eggs. And Im like, chill out Mom, I'You will show me this goose.Yeah. But its back in, um, my land, with the humans, soThe Queen removes her crown, holding it in front of her, like a large ring resting on its side. Put your hand into the crown ring, she commands.Aedna slowly puts her left hand into it, expecting to see it poke out the other side, but instead it disappears into the ring. The Queen adds her hand and says something in elvish. Just before they swirl into the crown-ring, Poe joins them.**Aedna lies on a bed of pine needles, staring up at a cloudless blue sky. Beside her is a mouse with silver fur and pointed ears, and Poe perched on the crown.Caw!At once the queen becomes a mouseThe magics gone, as is her houseAedna with her story prevailsFuture author of fairy talesCaw!Poe hops gracefully into the crown and disappears before it disintegrates into a small clump of sticks and leaves. The mouse looks at Aedna, ears twitching. A red-tailed hawk circles above, eyeing the rodent with interest.Aedna stands up, brushing pine needles off her clothing. A blue butterfly flits by and she follows it, knowing it will lead her home.**""And that,"" Aedna smiles to the children sat round her in the school library, ""is how, many years ago, I learned how to spin golden stories."""
"RIGHT CHOICES, RIGHT FRIENDSHIPS","Hey Maxie, come on. Its getting late, Mrs. Markle said.Mom, I dont want to be on time. I dont want to be there at all.Now Maxie, we asked you before signing up for the workshop.Yeah, but you didnt tell me that it was residential. Plus people go to the same residential programme year after year. Nobody will let me into their gang, I will be a bigger joke than ever, wailed Maxie.Little pixies can be nice, just give them a chance. Besides all pixies have pointed ears.Maybe during your time. All the other pixies are going to make fun of me. And my ears are not just pointed, they are huge. They are so huge, that you could see them from the other side of the city. I cant hide my ears when I sleep.Dont be silly. You dont have to hide your ears Maxie, you look pretty. You are a cute little boy with cute little ears.Well, you are wrong about the little ears part.Well, I find them cute and so will the people who matter to you. Dont mind the haters, they will always exist. Now get in the car. Your father already loaded your suitcases.Maxie wailed along the way but obeyed and got in the car. He sat in the backseat, cross with himself and everybody else.He had big ears and he knew it, bigger than most pixies his age. They stuck out like daggers, daggers he hid under his cap during the day. But he could not sleep with his cap on. They hurt his neck. He had to remove them. And then, all the other pixies would see his giant ears sticking out and make fun of him. He felt tears form in his eyes. He wiped them off vigorously. If there was one thing he was not going to do, it was weep like a baby. He looked out the window.Now, Maxie, you will be a good boy, wont you. We dont want to hear about any fights or such okay, said his mom.If the other pixies are nice, said Maxie.Is this about the ear again. Maxie, you look good. It is only you who thinks that your ears arent cute, said his dad.No, dad. So do the twenty odd students from summer camp last year. All of them thought that my ears were the size of an elf.You still have to be good because we wont be driving mid-camp to pick you up, said his dad.But, started Maxie, but was cut off.He was crosser than ever.They reached the gates and Mr. Markle parked. They got down and Maxie dragged his large suitcase over to the front desk. His parents walked with him to the front desk.Maxie Markle, Maxie said.The busy lady in the front desk looked through the record in the log book and passed over a notebook for his parents to sign. They dutifully signed, kissed Maxie and walked back towards the car.Good boy, they mouthed as the car moved away.Pixies started to stand in groups and talk and catch up with each other. Nobody took any notice of Maxie, they all had their own gangs, the kind of thing that Maxie was afraid of.Maxie chose a corner in the waiting room and sat inconspicuously, waiting for the lady to complete the signings and sending off of parents before she got down to allotting rooms.Another pixie, clad in a beautiful purple dress walked over to him.Hi, I am Linda, she said sitting next to Maxie.Hi, I am Maxie, he said scooting over.This is my first time in this camp. Have you been here before? she asked with big beautiful eyes.Um, no. This is my first time here too. But I have been to other camps before, he said.Thats nice. I am a little scared.Well, dont be. As long as you fit in, there is going to be no problem. You seem young, so there will be many your age who are here for the first time as well, he said with a small sigh.Lets hope I fit in then, she said, with an invisible sigh as well.The lady started to call out rooms. Girls first. Lindas name was called.Bye, hope to see you soon again, Linda said dragging her suitcase along.Bye, waved Maxie.Soon, Maxie was allotted to a room as well.He walked into the room allotted to him. There were three other pixies already in the room. They stood near one of the beds and spoke, laughing loudly on occasions. Again, nobody took any notice of Maxie.He didnt bother either. Two stupid weeks and he would be out of there. He had many friends back home. He could always go back to talking to them, once he was home.He was lost in his own thoughts and he suddenly bumped into another pixie.Hey, watch where you are going freshy, he said.Sorry, said Maxie and quickly collected his thoughts. He walked over to the bed with his name tag on it and put his suitcase down.He just sat there. He wanted to talk to some of the other pixies, but he was afraid.Finally, when he saw the gang of five turn to just two, he walked over to them and tried to introduce himself.Hi, I am Maxie, he said.Well, everybodys got a name dont they, said one of them.Dont be rude Ash. Hi, I am Rocky, said the other one.Hi, Maxie smiled not knowing what to do next. This was all one big mistake.There was an awkward silence, and then Rocky broke it.Oh, we were just going to go around and look at what we missed over term. Do you want to join us? asked Rocky.Maxie could see the rest of the gang glare at him from the door. He didnt want to put Rocky in any trouble, so he said, No, I need to unpack first.Okay, join us if you get done soon, said Rocky, trotting over to join the rest of the gang.Maxie went back to his bed and sat there wondering if Linda was able to make friends.He sat there until the dinner bell was rung. He slowly got off bed and walked over to the dining hall. He didnt know where to sit. He found an empty table by the end of the room and sat there as other people with nowhere to go, filed in next to him. They all ate in silence. Maxie went back to his room slowly. He dreaded removing his cap. He desperately didnt want to. But he would look equally silly sleeping with a cap on.He waited for the others to go to bed. He undressed and sat on the bed pretending to look at a cartoon in a magazine that he had brought with him. He had his cap on though it didnt match his night dress. The others filed into bed one by one. He waited for the warden to switch off the light before he removed his cap.The warden came along finally and saw Maxie sitting on his bed.Maxie, you have to lie down for me to switch off the lights, she said.Maxie glared at her and lowered himself.Maxie, you forgot to remove your cap, you silly little boy, she admonished.He saw that all eyes were now on him. He took his hands to the cap slowly and removed the cap. His giant ears stuck out and a ringing laughter went through the room. Maxie turned red in the face and pulled the blanket over his face. He could no longer control himself, he cried soundlessly.Once he was out of breath, he saw that all the others were sound asleep, and why wouldnt they be, they werent hurt. He got out of bed and walked to the door.He didnt want to be on the room anymore, it suffocated him. He noiselessly left the dorm and walked to the pond. He walked slowly to the pond and found a shadow there. He moved away swiftly before the pixie noticed him. He didnt want to get caught and his parents to be called.He heard sobbing noises. He didnt know who it was but the person could not be a counsellor. The sound belonged to somebody much younger.He walked over to the bench and peeped. He found Linda sitting there, sobbing into her hand-kerchief.Linda!Linda sat up with a start, then relaxed a little after seeing that it was Maxie.What are you doing here, sobbing late into the night? he asked.What are you doing here? she asked drying her eyes.They looked at each other.Okay, fine. Everybody laughed at me, so I came here, she said finally.What, why? he asked.You wont laugh? she asked.Of course, I wont he said.She removed the cap of her head and her ears were just as big as Maxies.She looked at him. He just silently removed his cap too. She was shocked for a second, then smiled.Now I know why you are here. You want to hang out?Yes, I do."
Bitter the Cherry,"Let it burn, let it blight.Moon above and out of sight.Cloudy the welkin is tonight.Peak the tale, let it start.Let your wisdom lips unwrap.Tell the story oldest friend.Reach the end and start again. Somewhere in a village, far from the home you call your own, lived once a good woman. She was happy and big herself, as was her laughter. And known was the woman truly in her little village, for the bestest pies ever were prepared by her hands. All the other women in the village were always jealous of her and often tried to distract her and steal her recipes, but the woman never told them any, and she wasnt planning to either. Her recipes were her own. For her husband and her daughter the pies were meant to feed. But what was truly the magic secret, that made her pies so yummy?The womans secret was using the wild fruit of the forest. The woman had never once bought fruit from the town. No!The wildest berries had a magical taste, as if the magic of the forest had blessed them. Their sugar boiled and bubbled. Cinnamon the woman added, vanilla she did pour. Ginger root she grinded and pepper she did too. Spices and honey to put inside the most delicious food. The oven she heated up and stuff them there for good. When the pies were ready the woman would run around the town to spread the joy of life and open up her windows so the smell of magic could reach everyone in town and take them always by the most wonderful surprise. One day, drisk rainy and dull, the woman decided once again to climb up the mountain hills and pick up fruit. She hoped that with her pies even in a day so bad the taste and sweetness could make things feel better again. Even in the pouring rain the people could be happy. She could make that happen!And so once again she walked into the wood. With big basket in her arms she headed. But this time things were different. And the woman crossed the bridge over the running river and down the path of mushrooms, she reached her spot like she always did. A clearing in the middle of the forest! Lush and luscious plenty with shrubs and greens and flowers blooming of all colors, shapes and sizes. And down there, by the end of the path she saw her favorite trees and bushes, the ones she always visited to fill up her basket.She walked and sang herself the oldest country song. Up Ill take the country road, into the mountains peak I ll goUp the hills and down the river, wear thick socks so you dont quiverBless mi soul to be strong, wish that nothing will go wrongFruit so tasty I shall pick, sweet and juicy, fairly meek And as she sang so she hoped and reached the first shrub. A shrub covered up completely by strawberries. And down she fell on her knees to pick the most juicy strawberries she had ever seen. But there strangely from behind the shrub jumped out curious creatures. She counted one, two and three. She did. When the woman looked up she recognized what they were, but she did not believe her own eyes.Are you? she asked them We are indeed! replied the fairies. Three of them and gorgeous as they flew around on their fragile-most wings. The first sat quietly on the branches of the shrub. Her dress made of bluebells and sea-holly flower, magical and blue. The second fairy had rosy cheeks as red as her dress. Thorny her attitude like thistle and she rhymed an old forgotten song. But the last fairy and third was perhaps the most beautiful of all. The fairy in green had a dress made of grass and she quickly begun looking at her reflection in the running river.My good fairies said the woman Forgive me, but I do not understand. What is it that you want from me? And the fairies looked at each other and laughed.Woman of the village are you now? Well here we came not to worry your good nature but to guide you in your bad decision What bad decision? replied the woman scared and the fairies rushed themselves to explain.The strawberries you are picking up from the shrub are awful and dry. So unlucky anyone who eats them. Please leave them right this instant! Otherwise, no one will enjoy your pies But the woman did not understand.My good fairies, I have been coming to this shrub for years and picking my strawberries off the leafy branches. I have made pies to many I must say to fit a handful and no one has ever said a single bad thing about them but the fairies did not like that at all.No they said Woman you are mistaken. This shrub is dry, not juicy, as it always has been. Listen to our word old woman and trust our knowledge. We are fairies, guardians of the forest and ancient as much as time. We know better than you do and you should not dare question our judgement! so the woman could not refuse all that they said and simply sighed. Sad for there were no strawberries now in her basket, she moved on to the second shrub. A shrub wild and green, bearing the freshest berries her eyes had ever seen.Berries of blue and berries of red. Berries old and new, berries all around her. On her knees yet again the woman fell, holding the basket firmly. But as she picked the first berry here came the fairies once again with their beauty and songs they flew in circles around the woman.What on earth are you doing? they asked brightly and pondered.Picking up berries I do, for my pies back home replied the woman. However the fairies didnt like that either.No, no! You shouldnt. These berries are so old, look at them there rotting and the woman as they said se did and looked at them in wonder.My good fairies I do not mean to be disrespectful, but these berries look fresh as spring to me and tasteful as always. Forever Ive been putting these berries in my sweets and people couldnt stop to eat themAlways?questioned her the fairies Listen here old woman, to our words prosperity. We are the fairies, guardians of the forest. You will not find creatures more brilliant and magical as we are in these woods, that we can assure you. These berries are old and squishy, so awful, as they always have been. Dont you dare disrespect our knowledge human. You are neither magical nor wise. The people in your village are liars! They lie about your sweets and nobody truly likes them. Just trust in us and move alongand so the woman did trust in them, for they seemed wise and magical and as advised so she did. Along she moved the path.But soon enough she stopped again in front of her most trusted friend. A cherry tree she called Jerald. Rich plenty and strong. Up there on the heavy most branches she saw the sweetest cherries she had ever seen. Cherry pie was her favorite sweet to make and people in the village would like it too. She did not have strawberries or berries, but cherries now she did. And up the tree she climbed to pick up the sweetest treats.But here came the fairies once again and on the roots of Jerald they laid to rest. Oldest tree Jerald is Said the red fairy So old, so very old agreed her two sisters. The woman was now sad and hopeless. Cherries were her lats chance to do things right.My good fairies. Jerald has been my friend for many years and I always get down the best cherries off his branches. The sweetest cherries anyone has ever tasted. People would kill to get the recipe which I do not share. Let me at least have the cherries, please my fairies, please but the fairies did not care the least bit.You are a disrespectful old woman. What would you know? Jerald is as old as we are, and we have known him since before he became so tall and mighty. However, the beauty of the cherry tree does not compare to the distasteful taste of its fruit. Cherries hear are bitter. The bitter-most you ever had. We are fairies, old and mystical. Our knowledge surpasses yours and our word you better cherish.People hate your pies woman and that they always have. The cherries here are bitter, as they always have been. You better not pick them up and if you love your pies, you wouldnt dare put them inside of themLosing all hope the woman was now left alone by the fairies and she was almost crying. With basket empty she walked down the road. She returned home and locked the doors and all the windows. And people waited for her days after days to smell her pies and taste their sweetness, but the windows never opened again. Because the woman trusted what the fairies had said and as they advised her, so she did. She never went back to the forest to pick up fruit, but instead she went to the shop. As a result, her pies were awful and people really hated the new recipes, but the woman had faith in the fairies. Indeed, she did cherish their words.What the woman didnt know is that the fairies had lied to her. They had lied not once, but thrice. Three times and no less than that. About the strawberries and berries and all the cherries. Lied about their nature. Because the fairies werent the good kind. They were mean and selfish. And with the woman out of the way now they had all the fruit. Juicy, fresh and sweet, all of it for themselves alone. Yes. The fairies were wise. But hey were also devious tricksters of the forest.And as the years went by the woman grew even older and her husband passed away and when her daughter came of age, she asked of her mother to give her the basket. The daughter was planning on walking all the way to the other town to pick up some of the things they needed. Like pasta, jam and buttermilk. And the woman of course told her daughter that she could go.As the daughter began walking, she realized that the forest was the fastest way to go. Instead of going around the mountain, she would cross the forest and make it to the next town in half the time. She headed so, as she decided, deep into the wood. She followed the old path and there she crossed the bridge above the running river and then down she headed a road of many mushrooms. The daughter ended up in a place she had never seen before. A clearing in the middle of the forest. A clearing lush and luscious as any.And right there, where the long path ended the daughter was lost for words to spot a wild shrub, heavy full its branches of strawberries unlike any other. All of them so red, big and juicy. thought the daughter, because she still remembered that sweet and magical taste of her mothers pies. But mother hadnt made a single pie in many many years. And the daughter, curious and rather hungry moved towards the thick shrub and went down on her knees to pick some of them for herself. She looked around and nobody was there to stop her because the fairies you see that day had all stayed home to sleep the day in. So the daughter with pockets full of strawberries noticed a second shrub and as the first so she did the second. The daughter kneeled and begun picking up the berries off the second shrub. They all were fresh and moist from the morning rain and smelled of the exquisite scent of the forest.And when the daughter was done, she surely moved a tad further down the path and came across a known tree by name, a friendly tree as any.Jerald was still there! Cherries plenty on his branches, yet to be eaten by someone. And so she turned her jacket now inside out and begun filling up the pockets with cherries. As she was almost finished, unable to carry more with her at the time, the daughter decided to head back home instead of the town. And walk back home she did.When mother saw her with pockets full of fruit she gasped Daughter she said. Daughter my where did you find all these fruit In the forest I did mother. In the clearing I did find them by the river. Here, mother, try them too. They are wonderful, with taste almost magical Id say. I thought that maybe if I got you some of the wild cherries you would make again one of your special pies. We havent seen one of those in years Now mother was furious! Because poor mother had trusted the fairies so long ago. Year the year slowly she had actually convinced herself of a truth that wasnt real. That the wild cherries had horrible taste. So sure she was it was as if her tongue didnt recognize their sweetness. No. What she though, that she felt. And the taste she felt was bad.How dare you bring in my home these disgusting fruit. So Dry and old and squishy. So very bitter those cherries are. Awful! mother yanked one of the cherries out of the daughters hand and ate it, but she didnt swallow. No. Instead she made a weird face and spat the cherry on her hand and then tossed the fruit out of the open window.Now, what mother and daughter expected the least to happen, was for the cherry that landed on their backyard to actually be a good seed and before they knew it a stockyCherry tree emerged from the ground. But this time things were different. Because the soil on the village was mostly dead and barren. Infertile-most in all the land and dry as a dandruff skull. The people who tried the cherries of the tree were not impressed at all. No. They were furious and devastated. The cherries from that tree were so bitter and distasteful even the pigs wouldnt eat them. So they decided one day to tear out the tree and throw it over the cliff. And everybody gathered, all the people around that tree. They tied to bark with ropes and pulled as hard as they could to try and yank the tree out of the soil. But before all that happened suddenly out of the tree came the three fairies again.The first sat quietly on the branches of the tree. Her dress made of bluebells and sea-holly flower, magical and blue. The second fairy had rosy cheeks as red as her dress. Thorny her attitude like thistle and she rhymed another old medieval song. But the last fairy and third was perhaps the most beautiful of all. The fairy in green had a dress made of grass and she stood up in front of the tree to look at the humans. And brightly addressed them all.How bad a judgment you got humans, I look at you and ponder. This tree right here is the best of the best. A thoughtful gift from the ancient forest and lucky you are so to see it grow in your own garden. What fools are you really to try and yank it out But the people were angry and looked at each other confused more than calmly settled.""Maybe you are wrong! We tried to fruit ourselves and found them horrible to say the least""How dare you! said the fairy Listen to me humans and my words dare you not take lightly. This tree is a gift and I would know better. Fairy and magical myself, so old I am and wise. The cherries on this tree that grows in your garden are the most delicious. All of the animals and creatures of the forest are so unlucky and sad not to have a tree as tasty as yours in the forest. But we are not here to steal your gift. No. The tree is yours and you should be happy we let you keep it. But since you have such a wonderful tree here there is no reason for you again to visit our forest. Keep your tree and we will keep our own. Now doesn't this sound fair? And indeed her words, they did sound fair.So the people of the village agreed to the terms. One of them even tried the cherries of the tree again and admitted they were not so bad as he had thought at first and so the people proudly called this tree their own and for ages to come they never again step a single foot inside the ancient forest.And as you would expect, the selfish and canny tricksters, the fairies had proudly won. Making humans believe that the cherries on their garden where of the good kind, and the ones in he forest were a disgrace to all the fruit. When in reality, it was exactly the opposite.So learn from their story and wisely keep, that not all that we hear is true and that you dont trust someone simply because he tells you so, without any proof. In this cloudy curious world. Let knowledge be your weapon and judgement, your brightest light. Believe in yourself and things will magically be better"
Thereby Hangs A Tail,"There was once a boy called Billy Nutbeam who lived with his mother and father in a small cottage near a dense forest. His father worked at a nearby farm. Billy accompanied him to see the young calves and the new yellow chicks.But animals and birds didnt like Billy. He always pulled their tails. He just did it to tease them, and they hated it. It frightened them. Billy didnt care, and he just went on pulling them.Billy pulled the tail of Whiskers, his mothers cat, and often caught hold of the long, shaggy tail of Bingo, his fathers old dog, and made him yelp with pain. He pulled the ponys tail, and he even pulled the pretty, drooping tail of Doodle-doo, the farmers prize cockerel.The thoughtless lad did it just to annoy the animals and didnt appreciate the distress it caused. To be fair, he never forgot to feed his rabbit, and he always saw that the dog had plenty of water in his bowl. However, the inconsiderate teasing upset his mother. Im ashamed of you, Billy, she said. One of these days something will make you sorry for pulling tails so much.Billy laughed at this warning. He ran out of the back door, pulling the cats tail as he departed.During the summer holidays Billy went for a long walk in the forest. It was a lovely sunny day, and hed offered to gather some wild berries for his mother. He followed a winding path that led between the trees into the wood and he searched for ripe fruits, but struggled to find much that was worth picking.Billy continued down the narrow track between the tall and shady trees until he encountered a bright clearing in the forests heart that was a perfect place for strawberries. They were plump, sweet and plentiful and many more than he could carry home. He collected many handfuls and stashed them in his knapsack.Billy wasnt the only person engrossed in harvesting the bountiful crop. He lifted his head in search of more runner stems and noticed a little girl with a wicker basket. She had the prettiest face he had ever seen, framed by short-cropped hair. Her hands and feet were petite and yes, she had cute pointed ears too.Billy ducked down so as not to be spotted and watched her flutter about. She was so light, Billy was sure that she hovered above the ground as she moved.The lad recalled stories of woodland folk that lived deep in the forest, but he assumed those were just Grandma Nutbeams daft tales. She raised Billy on her bedtime stories about goblins that lived under tree trunks and ogres who inhabited riverbanks, but hed never believed them until now. She could only be a pixie, he surmised.When the little girls basket was full, she drifted into the forest. Billy wanted to know where she lived, and he followed her at a discreet distance. His pulse raced as he gave chase. He was careful not to make too much noise. He didnt want to frighten her in case she flew away.The trees thinned out again and in another clearing was a dainty peach-coloured cottage. It had an oval door, two matching windows and a roof made from straw. The pixie floated up the footpath, disappeared inside the building and shut the door.A cream coloured wall ran around the garden, and on top was an elegant black cat. Its slender limbs and straight back gave it a majestic air. Billy observed the curious feline. He concluded it could only be a pixie cat, and he reached out to stroke it. The cat had a haughty manner and raised its whiskers with disdain as Billy approached. Its long black tail lolled back and forth as if it was marking time. The cat allowed Billy to stroke its long, sleek back and purred as his fingers curled round its tail. Its awful yellow eyes rolled over, and it hissed as Billy tightened his grip. Billy narrowed his eyes and smiled at the cat as he pulled with all his might. The beast appeared to grow, its eyes flashed a hellish crimson, and it screeched with a shrill high-pitched cry.Billy stepped away from the animal and the colour drained from his face. The cat disappeared from view and it left Billy clutching the long black tail in his right hand. The cat meowed, and he spotted it leaping up and through one of the oval windows into the house. He heard a shriek and crash from within.The door flew open and the little pixie appeared. The little girl no longer looked pretty or friendly. What have you done to my cat, you nasty boy? She screamed at Billy. You wicked boy! she yelled. My poor cats tail!I didnt mean to, said Billy, shaking as tears came to his eyes. Believe me, I---I dont believe you, shouted the pixie as she fluttered toward him. All the animals complain you pull their tails.But what can I do with this tail? He wiped his eyes with his shirt cuff. Can you reattach it?No, I cant, you silly boy! she said, landing in front of Billy. Tallulah will grow a new one, but thats not the point, she said. They come off easily and its very painful for them.I wouldnt have pulled it if Id known that, I promise you---Tail snatcher! she said, grabbing the writhing appendage. Keep it for yourself!The pixie threw the tail at Billy and it darted around his head like a flying serpent, avoiding his flailing arms.No! No! The tail wriggled down inside Billys shirt and trousers, and attached itself to the base of his spine. Billy grabbed the contorting limb and tried to release it. He pulled and yanked, but it was no good. There was no way to remove it. The tail was grafted to him and all he did was hurt himself.The little pixie laughed at Billy. How she laughed and laughed. She held her sides and laughed until tears rolled down her cheeks. The laughter echoed from the nearby trees and into the dark forest beyond. Billy looked around and spotted little faces emerging from behind tree trunks and bushes. Before long a mighty congregation of brownies, gnomes, bogles and goblins surrounded Billy and the pixie. When the pixie explained what had happened, they all started laughing as well.Please help me Billy couldnt hold back his tears. The raucous cacophony drowned out the poor lads pleas. It was impossible to be heard above the assembled crowd. He stumbled about as little hands reached to grab his tail. He retreated into the forest before running away and leaving behind the hysterical laughter.Billy followed his footsteps as he charged through the dense woodland. He was out of breath and gibbering to himself when he collapsed in a grazing pasture. The wretched boy tugged his tail, but he couldnt remove it. It was a part of him now. That was that. There was no choice but to explain to his parents what had happened.#It was getting dark when Billy picked his way through his parents rear garden, his black tail swishing behind him. At last he reached the kitchen door and crept in. He was still wondering what to say. His parents were eating their supper when he entered their dining room. They looked up. What time do you call this? His mother began as the long black furry tail wafted into view. Billy, watch out!What on earth? His father stood up, grasping a sharp knife from the table.Please, father dont---Whats that youve got there?Billy explained the story to his parents and his mother furrowed her brow. I told you something would happen to you one day, she said. The best thing to do is stop pulling tails and pray yours will disappear.#Billy stopped his cruel pranks, but it didnt go unnoticed amongst the local animals that he now had his own tail. Every time Billy passed a squirrel, cat, duck, dog, goat, donkey, cow or horse, they dashed up behind him and gave his tail a good pull. How they quacked, howled, squawked and barked with laughter. Whiskers would give it a good scratch, and Bingo would lie in wait and make him jump.I hope you appreciate what it was like for all those animals, said his father.But cant you make it stop? Billy asked.Mrs Nutbeam examined her sons new appendage every day and agreed with her husband it was there to stay.For eight weeks Billy endured the pixie-cats tail, and many times a day he suffered when he had it pulled. He tried putting the end in one of his pockets, but it wouldnt stay there. He tried tying the tail to his chest, and it escaped to dance around behind him. The tail had a mind of its own. It waved about in the air both day and night and wouldnt keep still. Billy was powerless to stop it. He just had to put up with all its terrible antics.Your tail doesnt look like departing, Billy.Im so sorry, he said, I cant stand it any longer, Mum.Its getting worse, I imagined it wouldve dropped off by now.Ill never pull another tail again.Billys parents discussed the problem with Grandma Nutbeam. The ways of the woodland folk were her area of expertise. She suggested contacting the pixie and telling her Billy had learnt his lesson. Mister Nutbeam smirked when he heard the idea, but Billys mother agreed to try it. She wrote the pixie a letter saying how much her son had changed and how contrite he was. Its all we can do, she said.It took the family all day to locate the pixies cottage, and when they found its whereabouts it saddened them to discover it looked abandoned. They left the envelope on the doormat and trudged home with their heads hanging in despair.#The next day, as Billy was feeding the animals their morning rations, he felt a strange twisting sensation in his tail. The tail rotated and shot up into the air and danced for dear life. After a moment, it fell to the ground, slithered across the floor and disappeared under the door.Yes! Yes! he said. Mum! Dad! Im free at last!Now let that be a warning, Billy.Ill never do it again, he cried. Its a vow hes kept until this day.#People say the tail is out there somewhere waiting to find another cruel child whos not learnt the lesson. Lets hope thats nobody we know.The End"
GOTCHA!,"Finn always saved her house for last, not just for the chocolate, but the love of mischief that had been his standard all these long years.It was tiring work, visiting so many homes in one evening, and if it wasnt for the folderol of that last house he would have been bored a long time ago.Rose was a conundrum of a human being.Since childhood she had shown a predilection towards the sciences, constantly experimenting with the world around her in order to make sense of it.The first time he visited her home, he was met with dozens of erector sets in various manipulative forms that he surmised tested gravity, centrifugal and centripetal force, and propulsion systems.On the dresser top were several pieces of colored glass and prisms, kaleidoscopes, homemade telescopes, and plastic containers filled with liquids of many colors.Hanging from the ceiling on pieces of string were several origami birds and balsam wood models of Da Vincis inventions, paper airplanes, and miniature kites.He had been in wonder during that initial visit in the middle of the night, tip-toeing between the contraptions as if they were robots that would magically come to life and reach for him, and then to see the box and stick trap taking up the middle of the floor with scattered quarters and pieces of chocolate beneath it waswell, it was laughable.In fact, he might have uttered a chuckle or two at the pure absurdity of its simplicity.Finn was a bit more mischievous than usual for that first encounter.Perhaps it was his way of proving that he was cleverer than she thought, or maybe he wanted to make her feel dumb.Either way, he went to work with a glee that he hadnt felt in a hundred years.The first thing he did was take apart every contraption that Rose had built, putting all the pieces of the erector sets into a large pile in the middle of the floor, topping the mountain with the box trap like a jaunty hat.He then emptied all the bottles of liquid into the tub and toilet.After that, he took a permanent marker and colored all the pieces of glass, as well as those in the kaleidoscopes and telescopes.Finally, he tangled and knotted up the strings of the objects hanging from the ceiling.When he was finished, he sat back and surveyed his work, congratulating himself on the great job.Finn knew hed be talking about this mess for the rest of the year, maybe the next decade, and when he finally left the house and began the trip home, he was wearing a smile on his face so wide that it pained the edges of his mouth.He thought it would end there.Maybe one more trip and that would be that.After all, the girl was not the usual believer.But sure enough the next year he was met with the same trap, surrounded by roughly the same type of contraptions.There were a few different things here and there, but the general gist remained.Everything in the room spoke of a girl who was concerned with the science of the world and how things worked.That time, he was slightly annoyed.The same simple trap, when he knew for a fact that she was far more capable.It was almost as if Rose thought him an idiot.After the wonderful display he left for her last year, he expected something more intricate, but thisit almost mocked him.In retrospect, Finn had to admit that he went a bit overboard in his zeal.By the time he was finished, he was panting with exertion and sweat was coming out of every pore.He even stuck around to see the cacophony of the next morning when the girls parents saw the mess.Of course they blamed Rose, and the ensuing punishment was deliciously satisfying to witness.He went home that day and just knew it would be the last time he needed to visit Rose Abalean.But the girl was persistent.He had to give her that.And no amount of maturity seemed to dissuade her from the course.The years passed and he was drawn to her house each time, always to find that same simple trap.The surroundings changed a bit, especially once the teen years hit.The walls were surrounded with posters of singers and actors, replacing the diagrams of the water cycle, volcanoes, and the plate tectonics, but like all things Rose soon returned to what she loved the mostscience.By the time she was sixteen, the contraptions in her room became even more confusing.Beakers and bulbs, microscopes and flasks, lamps and centrifuges, burners and clamps, littering every surface and almost every inch of floor.But sure enough, like clockwork, whenever March 17 arrived so would that damnable box trap.Over the years, Finn had scaled back his destruction, mostly because he couldnt top the first two visits, but he always arrived and left with a sense of bemusement.He just couldnt figure out why she kept the gag going.And then came the year Rose turned eighteen.He knew right away upon arrival that something was different.It took a moment or two for him to figure it out, and when he did, the bemusement was replaced with confusion.The room looked as it did upon his very first visit.The chemistry stuff was gone, as well as all the trappings of her teenage years.The birds and models were hanging from the ceiling as if theyd never left, and the erector set things were again laid out on the floor, except this time it was a bit more crowded, as if Rose had purchased more of them.And he noticed one more thing.The erector set contraptions seemed to be interconnected, a large mess of wheels and cogs, sheet metal and girders, bolts and nuts sticking out everywhere in every direction, but all attached in one way or another.Finn shook his head.Perhaps what he had always thought of as simple childhood amusement, was in fact a mental illness of sorts.It would certainly explain the continued sham.Maybe it was time that he just stopped coming by.He was about to turn away, possibly say goodbye forever, when he spied something else other than the usual chocolates and coins beneath the box.Creeping closer, he saw that there was a small piece of folded paper sitting on a little round plate.Finn smirked with amusement.In all these years there had never been a note passed between the two of them.He wondered if an explanation would finally be had.It was only a few steps more to the box trap.Finn reached out and plucked the note from the plate, so insatiably curious that at first he didnt hear the whirling sound.By the time he took note of it, he was far too late.He wasnt sure what happened next, but all of a sudden the world exploded into movement.All those erector set gadgets shot into action, swinging and springing, clicking and whizzing, as if some sort of slumbering giant was awakening.Self-preservation finally kicked in, but just as he readied himself to run, a giant cage came crashing down on top of him from some previously undisclosed locationand he was trapped.In horror, Finn rushed to the edge of the cage and attempted to lift it, only to find he didnt have the strength.He tried squeezing through the bars, but only succeeded in getting his head stuck, a few moments of panic to wiggle it out again.Then a light flashed on, blinding him, turning his eyes into slits and forcing him to use the spaces between his fingers to make out the details.Rose lowered the flashlight so that Finn could see beyond the light.She wore a smile that he couldnt define.Looks like my experiment worked, she whispered in a deeply satisfied tone.She stood and walked over to the wall, flicking on the light switch.Then she opened her closet door, where Finn could see all the chemistry equipment she had cleared out of the room placed neatly in stacked plastic tubs.You might want to make yourself comfortable, she said over her shoulder, as she began to haul out all the stuff.Its going to be a long night.Finn turned away in horror, trying to blot out the sound the glass beakers made as they clinked together.On the floor, he could see that the paper he had picked up from the box trap had unfolded enough by itself that he could make out a single word written in Roses scrawling hand."
Fox and Rabbit: A Trickster's Tale,"A Trickster Fable written by: Jennifer M. Engel  	The worm moon was high in the silent March night sky, making it easier for Fox to see while digging his burrow.  It had been a long, harsh winter. Much of his food supply perished underneath the bitter snow, which seemed to laugh every time it heard Foxs growling stomach.	Foxs natural personality was not malicious. It was just that Mother Nature seemed to force him into situations that caused him to perform acts of devilish means, in order to ensure his (and his families) own survival. And so he used Mother Natures own scents to mask his own. The night before the worm moon was full, he wandered around the forest gathering pine needles, acorns, dirt; and yes, even his last victims scat. He returned home to grind up and mix a most peculiar paste that he would slather on his entire beautiful red coat turning it crusty, brown. This would not only help keep him camouflaged, as he set his plan in motion, but it also served as a way to mask his own distinct smell. Rabbits had become too smart and strong and quick to be hunted by the mere chasing and catching means.	Fox focused on the vision he had of his latest victim --a nice fat white rabbit who must have found the scrap pile often left by the Iroquois near one of the longhouses that were nestled near the forest. It had been complete with potato and carrot peelings, as well as other kitchen scraps. Scraps were not good enough for Fox. Fox needed meat, and meat he was going to get.	The forest was full of illusionary and deceptive behavior. The North and Eastern winds blew in feelings of delight and enlightenment, where even enemies seemed as if they could be friends. South winds blew in feelings of love and lust where animals were too fixated on the opposite sex to be bothered with such things as eating and sleeping. The wicked, west winds, however, blew in feelings of fright where nothing was safe from the foulness of pure unsatiated hunger, and it was those very same winds that were quickly approaching.	The tools in Foxs paw were about as ominous as the wind. He had to use the forelimb bones and claws of his last victim as digging tools. This was tricker than he originally thought, as he had to bind the smaller foot bones together with sinew to keep them from falling apart. As he dug he began to recall the conversation he had with Mr. Fat Rabbit just two evenings ago when the West Winds were still farther away.	Good evening, Mr. Rabbit.	Evening, Fox. Rabbits long ears perked up signaling suspicion of the interaction.	It feels so good to get out of dens and holes on a more regular basis now that it is more comfortable to do so, dont you think? Fox said with a smile and as much charm as he could muster.	Yes, yes. Rabbit hopped along his course with Fox keeping a side by side pace. The deers of the woods had made nice trails, which other animals could access.	But, I like to keep myself in shape no matter what time of the year it is. Thats why I always get out for a good morning run before settling down for the day. Rabbit said, doging under some thorn bushes that had arched their way over the trial.	True. Mr. Fox continued as his heart began to beat faster and his breath increased trying to keep up with Rabbits pace. Thats why I like to see if I can keep up with you. Gotta keep in shape. Im not getting any younger, you know?	Rabbit laughed nervously. Where are you off to today, Mr. Fox?	Just out for a jog. What coincidence that we ran into each other today! Foxs paws now softly padded against the earth in a pattern that almost matched his own heart beat.	Hmm, was all Rabbit replied.	Ill be leaving you soon, Fox panted out, setting a part of his plan in place, but before I go, I just want you know I overhead Mr. Jack say hes having a party two nights from now. Im not allowed to go, for obvious reasons, of course.	Of course, rabbit replied, his white paws now stained with the spots of mud from the wet spring ground.	But, I heard Mr. Brown say he wouldnt miss it for the world! Foxs breath was easy and rhythmic now as he found a good pace. He felt a surge of electric delight surge throughout his body as he thought his plan was coming along nicely. Ah! I wish this was a different time when we could be friends, rather than so suspicious of each other. I could use one good night of fun after this long, drawn out winter. You know what I mean? Fox smiled and winked.	I suppose so. Mr. Rabbit lowered his eyebrows. He kept his eyes forward as he needed to keep a lookout for any fallen branches, or any other obstacles, that may be in his path. Yet, there is always work to be done. He added as he tried to hint at the fact that he was, in fact, being bothered and not in the mood for this conversation.	True, true! But, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Fox laughed at his own joke, Get it? Jack? Jack Rabbit? I guess thats why hes having a party! Fox howled in delight at his own cleverness. His laughter seemed to break a bit of the suspicion Mr. Rabbit had been feeling as he gave into a little chuckle himself.	Well, sorry to bother you. Ill let you continue your run worry free. At the end of this trail I noticed some nice young dandelion greens beginning to sprout. You may wish to gather some and take them to your family. Fox began to slow down his pace as if to reinforce his words. He began to shout as the rabbit ran ahead, or take some to Jacks party! Three burrows down from the largest oak tree!	Thank you for the tip, Fox! he yelled over his shoulder and then his white coat disappeared into the darkness leaving Mr. Foxs mind to be brought back to his present moment.	He had finished digging the fake rabbit burrow, and was putting in the final touches: fresh dandelion greens, soft spring grass, anything he could find to help to set the mood. Soon the patterned paleness of the moonlight, that had found its way down to the forest floor, began to fade as the light from the dawn began to blend in and give rise to day. Fox went to the local stream, bathed, and went home to sleep and dream of his plans success.***	Rabbit was not fooled in the least by Mr. Foxs plan. No Sir! As soon as he heard Mr. Foxs plan he devised one of his own.	It was the evening of the supposed party. The moon lit up grass that covered the soft muddy path which led to Mr. Jacks place: three burrows down from the old Oak tree. He was not afraid of being eaten before arrival. Their winter runs had proven that the rabbits, more often than not, were way faster than Mr. Fox. Mr. Rabbit knew Mr. Fox would have to resort to trapping rather than chasing. So why then, did Mr. Rabbit hop confidently right into Mr. Foxes fake burrow?	***  	Mr. Fox smiled and licked his lips as he saw the fat, white coat squeeze through the entrance he had created the night before. He carefully crawled out from behind the tall, brown grass near the trap where he had been hiding. Weary of making as little noise as possible, he placed his paws on the as silently on the ground as possible. He was inching his way towards the opening-- dare he create any sort of vibration that might give a clue to the occupant inside as to any danger. Suddenly, he was paralized by a searing pain in his left side that caused him to topple over. A whimper and small howl escaped his lips as he felt the warmth of his blood leak out and begin to stain the forest floor. It didnt take long before the night that concealed his body clouded his mind, until... there was nothing.	What Mr. Fox didnt know, that Mr. Rabbit did, is that the Iroquios had gathered enough rabbit furs during their winter hunts. What they needed was more luxurious furs to trade; and so, there were men in the forest looking for Fox.	***	Minwaabadad:  one man said to the other.	The other nodded.	The first man threw Mr. Foxes body over his shoulder and left the clearing.	***	Mr. Rabbit slept soundly after the hunters left, resting in the knowledge that his own gut instinct (and wit) had saved him again... and would continue to do so."
The Ogre That Loved to Dance,"Back when the world was young, the morning skies promised adventurers excitement in undiscovered lands. Hilda, a tall, stout woman, dressed in nothing more than a loose tunic and short trousers, was one of those adventurers, having traveled years, far from her home in the north.	She hadnt wanted to be an adventurer at first. Her people kicked her out for her love of dancing, and every other place she visited wanted nothing to do with her. Over the years, though, she had grown to enjoy her adventures. At this time, however, she was tired and hungry and needed a place to regain her strength, and thus, found herself on the outskirts of a village.	The people of this area were smaller and fairer than Hilda; quick and slender, and given to much dancing. Knowing this, she worried how she would be received, wishing she too, could dance with them. Hilda fashioned a hooded cape from her travel blankets and pulled it close around herself. She bent her knees and stooped as far as she could to appear short like the villagers and so, made her way to the market.	As she passed the villagers, they carefully made way for her and greeted her politely. She nodded at them in what she hoped was a friendly enough gesture.	At the market, Hilda spoke as softly as she could to hide her gruff voice, and ordered what was, for her, a light lunch. Id like one of the roasted hens, a basket of greens, and a loaf of rye bread, please.	The vendor looked at Hilda, and then at the rising sun. Venerable lady, he said, believing her to be ancient by her stooped posture, its a warm morning. Wouldnt you be more comfortable loosening your cloak?	Oh no, she said, my customs require modesty, and I must stay covered at all times.	The man gathered her food and waited for payment. In order to avoid showing her large, dark hands, she said, Take the money from the purse that hangs at my waist, plus an extra copper for your trouble, and put my goods in the sack. I lost my gloves and cannot expose my bare hands.	He took the money he was owed and put her purchases in the sack she carried over her shoulder. I hope you enjoy that meal with your friends, he said, as it seems you have enough for four. My name is Henri. If you require anything else, ask for me by name.	Thank you, Henri, she said. I am Hilda. Do you know where I might find a room?	Priscilla, the shepherdess who lives at the end of this road, has a spare room, he said, for a low price. Tell her I sent you.	Thank you again, and I hope your day is profitable and as pleasant as you are, she said.	Hilda made her way to the end of the road, her stooped posture tiring her and making her joints ache. At the end of the road she found a cottage next to a field where sheep grazed. A broken-down barn, fallen fences, and overgrown brush marked the edges of the field.	While she was trying to decide how she would pay for lodging, the shepherdess approached. Hello, grandmother, she said.	Good morning, Priscilla. Henri sent me, Hilda said. My name is Hilda and I have travelled far.	Are you in need of a place to rest?	I am, she answered.	Are you not over-warm in that heavy cloak? Priscilla asked.	My customs require modesty, and I must take care to stay covered at all times.	You can sleep in the loft. Its two coppers a night, unless you can clear the brushes from the field, she said with a wink.	I can clear them, Hilda said, but I must do it at night, and no one may watch me, for I fear for my modesty.	Priscilla seemed unsure but agreed to let Hilda clear the field that night. Theres a shovel in the barn you can use, she said.	Hilda went into the cottage and up to the loft, which creaked and groaned under her weight. In short time she had finished the chicken, greens, and bread. The bed was far too small, but she lay down curled up to sleep until the middle of the night.	Rising when she was certain Priscilla was sound asleep, Hilda made her way out to the field. Once there, she removed her cloak and stood up straight. With large, clawed hands she ripped the brush out of the edges of the field, all the way to the woods. She was about to return to the cottage when she spied a wolf sneaking toward the sheep.	Hilda pounced on the wolf and tore its heart out with one swipe. She left the wolf carcass with the pile of brush and snuck back into the cottage.	When Priscilla woke, she found the wolf with the pile of brush. She must have used the shovel to kill it, she thought. She left a few coppers on the table with a note to Hilda that it was payment for ridding her of the wolf.	Hilda returned to the market, to buy another meal from Henri. Henri, it is a pleasure to see you again, she said.	You as well, grandmother. I had a very profitable day yesterday, indeed. I believe it was the smile you put on my face that made my customers happy.	They repeated the previous days exchange, Henri taking the money from her purse and putting the goods in her sack. This time, she told him to take two coppers for his trouble.	Hilda sweated terribly under the heavy cloak, but she dared not reveal herself for fear of not being accepted. If you are interested in a wolf pelt, she said, Priscilla has one from a wolf that was threatening her sheep. She would probably part with it for few coppers.	Thank you for the news, Hilda, Henri said, smiling broadly. Ill collect it later today. Enjoy your day.	Back at the shepherdess cottage, Priscilla offered the room for two coppers, or for repairing the fences.	Hilda looked at the fences. I can fix them, tonight. But no one must see me work, as I fear for my modesty.	Of course, Priscilla said. Theres a hammer in the barn you can use, along with nails, posts, and rails.	That night, when she was certain Priscilla was asleep, Hilda snuck out of the cottage. She gathered the nails, posts, and rails, and carried them out to the field in one large bundle. Working as fast as she could, she tore the rotting posts out of the ground by hand and replaced them with the new posts, pounding them into the ground with a single strike from her fist. With her thumb she pushed the nails in to hold the rails in place.	She was returning the left-over nails to the barn when she saw another wolf sniffing around the field. She pounced on it and smashed its head with one blow from her fist. Hilda left the wolf with the pile of old posts and rails and snuck back into bed.	The following morning, Priscilla found the wolf and thought, She must have killed it with the hammer. Again, she left a few coppers on the table for Hilda.	When Hilda returned to the market, Henri had her food ready to go, along with a bundle of cloth. Lady Hilda, he said, I know you value your modesty, but that cloak cannot be comfortable in these warm lands. Please, take this gift.	The bundle of cloth was a cloak and gloves in a lightweight linen. Hilda wished she could show her smile to kind man. Thank you, Henri. You are too kind. And with your cooking skills, you must be the catch of the village.	Its a small thing, he said, and I need room to start gathering furs for winter.	Priscilla has another wolf pelt she would probably sell you for a few coppers.	Thank you, Hilda. Ill check with her later today, he said, his smile threatening to extend beyond his face.	Hilda returned with her bundle and changed into the light cloak. It hid her as well as her heavy cloak. The gloves were far too small, but she could put just her fingertips and claws in, and by being very careful could make it seem like her hands peeking out from the cloak.	That afternoon, Priscilla offered the room for two coppers, or the repair of the barn.	Ill repair the barn, Hilda said. But no one must watch, for I fear for my modesty.	Of course, Priscilla said. I am curious how an old, bent woman with such a soft voice like yourself can do such heavy work, but I will respect your customs. There are nails, a hammer, planks, and a saw in the barn.	That night, Hilda snuck out to fix the barn. She cut the planks to length with a sharp claw and pushed the nails in with her thumb. In no time at all the barn looked fresh and new, and the old planks were piled next to it.	Another wolf crept into the field, moving slowly toward the sheep. Once again, Hilda pounced, and with her claws cut its head clean off. She left the carcass next to the old planks and snuck back into bed.	When Priscilla found the wolf in the morning she thought, She must have used the saw to kill it. Again, she left a few coppers for Hilda on the table.	Hilda collected her coppers and went to the market in her new cloak and gloves. Despite not overheating, the stooped posture and bent knees were taking their toll on her.	Henri greeted her with her lunch, packed up and ready to go. I see you wore your new cloak, he said. It looks far more comfortable.	It is, Henri. I cant thank you enough. She carefully handed him coppers for her meal, plus three extra, and took the bundle from him. Priscilla has another wolf pelt, she said.	Ill go round and collect it this afternoon, he said. The big village dance is tonight. Will you join us?	I love to dance, she said. She realized, however, that she would be unable to dance while stooped over and hunched. But, Ill have to see.	If your joints are too tired, theres always a warm place by the fire to sit and listen to the music, he said.	We shall see, Hilda said, then returned to the cottage.	I do not have any work for you tonight, Priscilla said, but if youll come to our village dance, I will let you sleep in the loft another night.	Hilda considered it. Priscilla and Henri had been nothing but kind, and the other villagers she passed in the market each day shared that trait. It would be an honor, she said.	The entire village turned out for the dance, held in Priscillas newly rebuilt barn. Musicians played a lively jig and the villagers danced and frolicked. Hilda wanted so to join them, but there was no way she could without showing herself, so she sat by the fire and tapped her toe to the rhythm.	It was during the late hours of the night, the party still in full swing, when a clamor arose from the edge of the woods. A boy ran into the barn, shouting, Its an army! Come to raid!	What will we do? Henri asked. Theyll take all my goods!	And all my sheep! Priscilla added.	Theres no use, the mayor said. We cant fight them! Well have to give them what they want.	Hilda threw off the cloak and gloves and rose to her full height, her gray-green skin shining in the firelight, and her long tusks gleaming. No! she exclaimed in her full, gravelly voice. I wouldnt let the wolves take Priscillas sheep; I wont let these dogs either.	She ran out of the barn, her steps thunderous, and yelled defiantly at the soldiers, Come try to take it! I dare you!	The villagers stood stunned as she slashed and pummeled the entire army with her bare hands, sparing only the cooks, the medic, the drummer boy, and the animals. An ogre had been staying among them for days, but they didnt know.	Shes an ogre, she should go! the fiddler exclaimed.	No! Henri and Priscilla said at the same time.	She has been helpful, Priscilla said, clearing my fields, fixing my fences, killing the wolves that would take my sheep, and repairing this barn. And she has been nothing but polite.	This is true, Henri said. She has been an absolute delight each day in the market.	We should not shun someone just because of their looks, the mayor said. If she wishes to stay, she is welcome as long she would like.	Hilda had been listening to all this and smiled. She did like the idea of staying in the village for a while, at least.	If she wishes to join us, the mayor said, she can join in this next dance! The mayor signaled for the band to start back up and the people began dancing again.	Overjoyed, Hilda joined in, her steps light and agile despite her huge size. They danced until the early hours of the morning, then Hilda went out to clean up the battle site. She built a huge pyre with the old slats, posts, and rails, and used the brush for kindling. She gave a reverent funeral for the fallen soldiers. The cooks, medic, and drummer boy were offered a wagon and an ass to leave if they chose, but having been pressed into service, they all chose to stay.	In the morning, Henri and the mayor came out to talk to Hilda. I see the army left fourteen horses, six asses, two oxen, and four wagons, the mayor said. Those are yours, as the spoils of combat.	I have no need of any of them, she said, but would like a place to build a shelter where I can stay when I am not adventuring.	The land between my field and the forest, which you cleared the first night, Priscilla said, belongs to no one. Im sure the mayor would let you claim it and homestead there.	Yes, he said, that is now your land. Do you need help building your house?	I can do it myself, she said, though I would like to trade these animals for some milk goats, a few hens, and a bed.	I can make a bed big enough for you, with a blanket and pillow, said the carpenter, for one of the wagons.	I can provide six goats for one of the asses, said the goat farmer.	I will give you eight hens, said the fiddler, if you can but accept my apology. I was wrong.	I do accept your apology and will give you an ass as a sign of good faith.	Despite her protestations, the entire village stayed to help her build her house. The sawyer provided all the lumber she needed in exchange for one of the oxen. The blacksmith provided the nails in trade for a promise of the first cheese she made from the milking goats. Others provided labor, and a large lunch for everyone on the promise of Hilda not leaving too soon.	So it was that in one day Hildas cozy cottage, and pens to hold her goats and hens were completed. The furniture maker brought the bed in his new wagon, and she had the first comfortable sleep in days.	She stayed until she had traded away the last of the spoils, then met with Henri in the market. I must go adventuring, she said, but I will return before the new moon.	I had something to give you, he said, but if you must go, take this with you for good luck. Henri gave her a ring hed had made, large enough to fit her massive finger, yet still delicate in its design.	Is this a declaration? she asked.	It is, Henri said, if you would have me. If not, keep it anyways, as my feelings will remain unchanged.	Why? she asked.	When you were hiding who you were, you were polite enough, he said, but no one could tell anything more about you. Now that you are yourself, you are a wonderful woman, ogre or no, and any woman who can dance the way you do is the woman for me.	You will have your answer when I return from my adventure, she said, her heart light.	When she returned from her adventure bearing a sack of gold and dragon scales, she married Henri, and he moved into her cottage. There she lived to the end of her days, bar the occasional adventure, repairing fences and barns, clearing fields, killing wolves, chasing off raiding armies, and, once a month, dancing with the rest of the villagers in Priscillas barn."
The Castle of Light,"Once upon a time far far away, so far away,in fact,that not even a tiny bit of sunlight or moonlight reached this land, there existed a secret kingdom. Youre probably wondering how the people of this land lived without light. Now you see they did have light, they had the glow that was emitted from the Castle of Light. This castle was covered in sparkles of every imaginable kind and colour. The source of this light was the queens great love for her people and her caring smile. This light covered all the land spreading only joy and prosperity.But like every story this one has a dark side. No one had ever been inside the castle to see the queen because it was forbidden. But everyone knew that inside the castle was great darkness,pitch-black darkness, and that was how it had always been.But then one day the pure light seemed to flicker and grow a little dimmer .The people thought nothing of it at first. But as days went on the light only grew dimmer and dimmer until it was almost pitch black. The town slowly grew into despair and famine. Everyone thought that their good queen had abandoned them and so they cursed her. Finally the people decided to go ask the old woman who sees before how they could get their light back. After all she claimed to see parts of the future so if anyone could help it had to be her.So they journeyed to the edge of the village where there stood a small cozy cottage and they knocked on the front door. An old woman openedup, YesI know why youre here, you want the same thing as me, to get our light back but I can only tell you how. The future isnt as clear to me as I would like it to be,she said.Okay, just tell us how much you know. A woman in the front replied.Very well, only he who is truly blind can bring back the light.The people were confused and started to mutter amongst themselves but they decided it was their only option and so the old blind man of the kingdom came up to the front I will tr-No not you, you are merely lacking sight, you are not truly blind, the old woman stopped him.You She pointed to a young man standing at the back of the crowd. You will be the one who brings our light back, she proclaimed. The crowd turned to face the young man she was pointing to. And as soon as they did they all protested in outrage for this young man was hated by every citizen of the kingdom. Why you ask, well youll find out soon enough. In fact one time the people were so fed up with him they even triedto have him drowned. Ever since,he had developed a nagging fear of drowning.The young man rolled his eyes and yelled over the protestingcrowd. Thisis stupid, this solution isnt even logical. I mean Im not even blind. But Ill go if only to prove this old hag wrong.Ignoring the fact that he called her an old hag, she said, I will give you a good luckcharm to help you on your quest.She then walked up to him and handed him a green orange Here is thy magical orange.This is even more stupid than this quest but sure why not, letsbelieve that oranges are lucky, he said sarcastically as he slipped it in his pocket Do not fail us young manour fate rests in your hands, she said to him. He shook his head and then stormed off to the castle. By trying to prove fate wrong he is only fulfilling his destiny. The old woman chuckled to herself.As the young man opened the doors to the castle he muttered to himself about how he was going to prove them all wrong and make them see that he was the only logical one. The castle doors creaked open and he was engulfed by the darkness. This doesn't make any sense either, this castle is our light source and yet these walls seem like theyve never been touched by light.Suddenly the room seemed to grow damp and cold. He noticed the feeling of water rising around his ankles. He felt the color drain from his face. Horrible memories of drowning and passing out underwater seemed to take over his thoughts. He panicked and started running blindly through the castle, his legs splashing through the water.Without wanting to he thought about the day he almost drowned. He still had no recollection of what had happened after he passed out that day, all he remembered was the feeling of warmth surrounding him before he woke up again in his bedroom. At first he had thought the whole thing had been a dream but he could feel that his clothes and hair had still been slightly damp. No matter what the case I wont let it happen again he had said that day.When he finally stopped running he realized he was lost. Thats when he started to hear thevoices. Youll never be right.It was the old womans voice. YOU! Youre the one behind all this? he yelled. The voices didnt reply; they only repeated the same thing over and over again. He thought he was going insane and started to whimper in fear. He hugged his body close for warmth and when he did he felt the lump in his pocket. THE ORANGE! He took it out, out of sheer hopelessness and to his surprise it looked like the orange was glowing slightly. The voices seemed to die down. This doesnt makeanyhe stopped. He didn't want to jinx it. Well. I guessbeing wrong wasnt the worst thing in the world,he thought to himself.With newfound strength he started to walk again and finally came upon a room from which he heard a girl crying. He walked in only to find a girl who was translucent and slowly turning to ash crying on the floor. This must be the queen. He thought to himself. He walked up and knelt next to her. Im so sorry, she whispered.For what?I dont have any more light left to give,shesobbed. He was taken aback. But how do we She stopped him Do the people still think about me? she asked looking up at him hopefully.No not really, they just want the light back, he answered casually ignoring her feelings. She sobbed even louder and more of her turned to dust. NO! I mean they think you abandoned them but but he tried hastily to make it better but it wasnt working. You know how this castle works? she sniffled. He shook his head Well no.You see, the castle amplifies a persons love and happiness and turns it to light. But it comes at a price, the persons happiness is sucked out of them and love needs to be renewed. I didnt want to ask people to renew the love I needed because this castle its not safe. Because inside these walls it doesnt amplify love and happiness, it amplifies your greatest fears. Mine is being forgotten andthe castle made me think I needed to sacrifice my happiness to be remembered. But it was a trap. I forgot myself in the process and now when Im gone  no one will remember me. She sniffled again. What whats your fear? she asked.Drowning I guess, he replied.Hewas still processing how all of this was highly illogical.Oh its you, youre the boy I saved that day. He was gobstruck. Wait it was you who saved me? But how? Youdont leave the castle. He was completely and utterly confused now. I dont need to leave the castle to be with my people. You all lived in my light, that light is a part of me. I see my kingdom through my connection to the light and it was with this same light that I saved you, she replied. His brain seemed to turn to mush. But why did you save me? Well because even though you might be a jerk who is completely oblivious to other peoples feelings, I still love you as I love all mypeople. Ithink... maybe if you were a bit nicer and a little less self obsessed it wouldnt have happened in the first place. She replied.He didnt know what to say. No one had ever done anything like that for him. Suddenly he realized what the old woman had meant when she had said that he was blind; he was blind to the feelings of others. He looked down again at the poor fading queen and decided he needed to save her, no matter what. There must be some way we can save you, he announced.Well, there is one way. But I couldnt ask you to do it. Its far too dangerousnow that Im already half gone,she said. No, tell me, well do it together.Whats the point, no one remembers me and theyll never remember me,she whined. Ill remember you, no matter what happens I wont ever forget you. Please let me help you He comforted her. It was a strange feeling for him, hed never felt it before and he couldnt describe it but it felt nice.You dont know how much that means to me. She smiled and seemed to glow for a second. Okay well theres a Pool of Selflessness on the other side of the castle. Only if someone truly cares about me will it heal me. So I cant do it by myself.Youll need to carry me and come into the water with me that is only if you actually care about me She explained. Of course I actually care... but wait I have to gointothewater? he stuttered.Im afraid so look I know youre scared but you have to trust me. Its the only way. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.Okay okay Ill do it. He picked up her half faded body and followed her directions to the Pool of Selflessness.He was surprised that he couldnt hear the voices any more. Did youhear any voices some time back? he asked hesitantly as he walked. You hear many voices in this castle, but each person will only hear their own fears coming true. Its another one of the castles tricks. What did you hear?she asked. They were saying that I was wrong.Well it seems drowning isnt your only fear. Do you still hear them? she questioned curiously. No they stopped a while back he replied. Interesting,she said slowly.What? Why?he asked, suddenly scared. No, you see the voices only stop when you get over your fear,she explained. Oh well I guess I did,he said sheepishly. He then went on to explain how he had reached there in the first place. When he had finished she smiled, making her glow again slightly. That orange wasnt magic or lucky in any way. In that moment you believed you could be wrong and you wanted to be wrong, you werent scared anymore. Thats what madethe voices stop. Not the orange, she said. Oh. Well I guess that makes more sense. He smiled. But then he realized her light seemed to be growing dimmer at a much faster rate. Right, no more talking. Save your strength, he ordered. She complied and they continued on in silence.When they finally reached the pool, she had almost faded completely. He saw the glint of water with the faint light she was emitting. He slowly walked towards it still carrying her. He was shaking by the time he finally put his feet in the water.Deeper, we need to go deeper, she whispered. He groaned loudlybutstartedwading deeper into the pool. Finally he reached a point where his legs no longer touched the bottom.He stopped. Trust me, you wont drown. He heard her sweet voice urging him on. He took a deep breath and immersed them both in the cold water. Then all he saw was bright light.The next thing he knew he was waking up in a soft bed. Had it all been a dream? he wondered but then he looked around and realized he wasnt in his own bedroom. In fact he couldnt understand where he was at all. Thats when she walked in. At first he couldnt recognize her but when he saw her smile he knew immediately, it was the queen. You...you look different, he stuttered.I feel different, she replied. Wait are we in the castle? he asked confused. She grinned. Yes, yes we are.But theres light, he pointed out, still dazed.Yes I know. Isnt it wonderful? She exclaimed and closed her eyes basking in the glow. She seemed to shine more brightly than he ever could have imagined was possible. I don't understand...how?he said.Right, sorry. You see the Pool of Selflessness was much more powerful than I imagined. Well technically, you cared about me more than I ever thought anyone could. When you immersed yourself in the water, you got over yourfear;you were completely pure; you had no more fears. The only feelings you had were well compassion and love. Also when you said you would never forget me my fear of being forgotten was also washed away. When both of us were together, the castle no longer needed to be dark, for the castles only purpose was to make a person the strongest they can be. And well when were togetherwe are the strongest we can be, she explained And so the lights returned,he finished.Yes, brighter than before She smiled. But. There is another thing; you can leave if you want. You are free to go. The light will not fade if you do choose to leave because I know you wont forget me,she said sadly. No why would I leave? Iwould rather stay with you than be outside withpeople who dont care about me, he said softly and she smiled a smile he would never forget. He had never felt this much emotion for a person before. He didnt want it to go away, it was a feeling he didnt want to lose. But there is one person I need togo meet, he said smiling a cheeky grin. This time when he reached the cozy cottage on the edge of the village he was alone. He knocked on the door.Well it seems you have fulfilled your destiny,the old woman said as she opened the door. Yes, I just wanted to say thank you and give this backto you. I dont need it anymore, he said as he handed her the orange. Ah yes thank you, she replied, taking the orange. I was regretting giving you my only orange, she said as she started peeling and eating it.He laughed andsaid,Yeah... I guess a banana would have done just as well. Shenodded,as her mouth was too full to give a reply.With that he left back for the castle and from that day on the whole kingdom lived happily ever after."
April Fool the Cat,"Hold up. Hold up. She turned abruptly to the mouse following her along the fence top, the little mouse bumped into her nose.     		Youre supposed to be writing my memoirs, cat-a-logging my adventures as it were. 	But I  doing just that, my finicky feline friend, answered Heeby, the small brown mouse. 	Cant you just say cat?You make me sound like a gargoyle or something 	Im using my artistic tongue, by which of course I mean pen. Heeby said defensively. 	Grrr.Okay.Just be aware I have full editing rights, said April.She liked getting her way.She was not used to having a friend around, she had to constantly remind herself to be a nice kitty and not let her ego get in the way of that friendship.I do admit you are pretty good at chronicling my yearly pranks.Just the fact that you can keep up with me is impressive. 	Who said we are friends? asked Heeby. 	Damn. Thought April.Shed forgotten that Heeby could read minds.It was part of their deal after all. 	Heeby said, Were more like partners in crime, like Bonnie and Clyde.Or Grinch and his dog.Id be the dog by the way. 	Never mind all thatIve spotted our next victim. April pointed to the house coming up on their right.Across the small, toy cluttered yard, the light from a window assaulted the night.They could see the curtain blowing gently in the cool spring breeze.On the sill was a muffin tin. In each little cup, a mound of sweet yumminess peeked up like a toad in a pond.April sniffed the air and said, Cranberry walnut.Perfect. 	Heeby said, Yuck, I hate walnuts.They give me hives. 	April sighed, thinking her partner in crime could be so dense sometimes.She said, Baking this late at night means that the mom in that house was told, at the last minute by her kid, that he needed to bring baked goods of some kind to school.Mom wouldnt bake cranberry walnut muffins for her kids class.She probably made blueberry or chocolate chip.With the extra batter, she then made her own favorite.Or perhaps her husbands favorite. 	You do have a brilliant mind, April. Said Heeby with admiration.I sometimes forget that you used to be a human being once. 	April pointed at the notepad in Heebys tiny paws and said, Keep writing.Its nearly midnight.My powers are ramping up.I feel the electricity in my whiskers. They quivered as if to prove the point. 	Heeby jotted down some more notes in his neat little shorthand.Then followed quickly behind April, not wanting to miss any of the events to come.They snuck around a rusty blue bicycle lying on its side in the weedy grass.The front tire was slowly revolving, its spokes catching the light, the back one was nearly flat.They tip-toed through a battlefield, where tiny plastic men were frozen in place. Some were ready to fire upon the enemy and some were already dead in the dirt.The enemy appeared to be a Hulk Hogan doll with its face melted off. At the window, they heard a woman humming to herself.The tune sounded suspiciously like the Stones Mothers Little Helper. April stifled a giggle.They peeked in and saw a thirtyish brunette woman in a red checked apron.She was brushing flour from her hands, while dancing around the room in a way only moms do when no ones watching. 	Better hurry, shes going to take the muffins inside any minute. Whispered Heeby. 	April concentrated on the moon for seven long seconds.Then she stared at the muffins with eyes full of borrowed moonglow.Then!A flash of brilliant blue like the flame of a jewelers torch, and Heeby knew that, once again, April had cast her wicked spell. 	Duck! whispered April.They ducked out of sight. 	The tone-deaf woman came to the window.Behind her in the house, a clock struck midnight.Ah-ha! Officially April Fools Day.She took the muffins from the window and put them on the table just below it.She inhaled the sweet arom- 	Wait!She sniffed again.The cat and mouse peeked in and could barely control their glee.The woman frowned.The muffins did not smell sweet at all, but more like rotten mushrooms marinating in a fetid mud puddle.Curiously, she reached for a knife.She gently prodded the top off one of the muffins.A dozen fat black cockroaches spilled out!Their many chitinous legs tap danced across the counter, their antennae licking the air as if to taste her fear. The poor woman screamed!It was a very long, very high-pitched scream indeed. 	By the time shed stopped screaming, April and Heeby were back at the fence, scrambling their way up it, while laughing the whole time.They sped across the top, on feet light as air, and back to the street.They followed the rural, potholed lane until they came to the edge of the woods where April lived.There they sat on a log, catching their breath, while Heeby scribbled away in his little pad. 	That was awesome! exclaimed Heeby, What a setta lungs on that one!You really lived up to your name tonight, April Fool. 	April licked the dew drops from her paws, and tittered a little, heh heh heh.I cant wait to read this years column.She saved each article, every year, and kept them in a scrapbook under her bed. 	Okay, Im ready now.If I get back by four am, Ill have my column in tomorrows paper. 	Sadly, April looked once more at the moon.She let its magic enter her eyes until they once again glowed that spooky blue color.Then she turned back to the mouse and worked her yearly promise spell.The tiny shadow of the mouse grew larger, then taller still, until it towered over April.The swarthy young reporter bent down and shook Aprils paw. 	Until next year...my friend. Said Heeby with a wink.Then he turned, pulled out a flashlight, and went back towards town. 	April followed a trail in the woods that only her sharp green eyes could see.She came upon a large oleander bush, tucked deep in ominous shadows.After crawling through to the other side- the secret side- she came to the little log cabin.She knew by the faint glow from the window, that only the fireplace was shedding it.The faint scent of burning pine was a pleasant welcome home.She slinked through the small red door, inside the people-sized one, and faced the witch. 	Well, April Fool, did you get it out of your system for another year? The old woman cackled to her familiar.She patted the sofa beside her.Next to the worn checkered sofa was a slice of honey-baked ham and a glass of warm vanilla milk on a tv tray.Aprils favorite meal.The old woman smelled of cinnamon, ginger, and soft downy feathers.Her ancient eyes radiated an unusual shade of pale green, just like her cats.After her kitty meal, April curled up in the witchs lap and purred to show her affection.April Fool was very happy.She was a lucky cat, and very much loved.The terrible nightmares about the awful orphanage she was stolen from now barely a whisper of memory."
Which Witch?,"Once upon a time, there was a kingdom of Rockpence which was ruled by King Kilgren, the Warrior King, and his lovely wife, Queen Catira.  King Kilgren was a wise and just king, and beloved by all his subjects.  He was a fierce warrior, feared by his enemies.  Because of this, no one challenged him and his people lived in peace. One summer, a blight came upon the kingdom. No one knew where it came from or what caused it, and His Majesty sent word far and wide in search for an answer. One day, a young girl sought an audience with the King, claiming she had the answer to his crisis. Elora was escorted into the King's Court. She was a simple peasant girl, with unkempt hair, dressed in rags, dirt on her face. She fell to the floor at the feet of Kilgren and Queen Catira. Kilgren sat uncomfortably on the throne. He was more used to moving around and getting things done himself and the whole act of holding court annoyed him. He looked over at his Queen, who calmly sat on her throne, watching the young girl who had prostrated herself before them. He rolled his eyes, then turned to the girl. Arise, dear girl. I was told you have an answer to this blight. Pray, tell me what you know. The girl stood up and brushed the dirt off of the skirt of her ragged dress. Yes, Your Majesty. I shall tell you what I know. My name is Elora. I come from the village of Steria. There, I was employed by an evil witch. She is always conjuring up something vicious for the local villagers. But this time, the blight she set onto the village crops has spread to all of Rockpence. You have to kill the witch to stop the blight. King Kilgren glanced at his Queen. She was staring at the girl, her face pensive. Kilgren looked back at the girl. Thank you, Elora, for telling me this. What is the name of your employer? I want to look further into this matter. The girl looked a little alarmed. Her name is Vira. She lives in the middle of the village, in the biggest house in the square. Don't worry, child, Catira soothed, you are safe here. The girl visibly relaxed. Jemel, show this young guest to a room, give her some clothes, food, and a place to wash up from her difficult journey. Elora, thank you again for telling me this information. The girl bowed before the King, then followed Jemel out of the hall. Kilgren turned to Catira. What do you think? he asked her. Catira shook her head. I have some doubts. Is Wareth in the room? she asked loudly. A tall, thin, young man approached the dais and bowed before the Queen. Good, she smiled at the empath. What do you make of this girl's story? Wareth looked troubled. She is lying, your Majesty. But I suspect you already knew that. I just needed it verified, Catira replied. What would she gain by coming here and lying about something like this? Kilgren scratched his short beard. I can think of nothing. We should send Wareth and a detachment of soldiers to Steria and have them look into the matter. Perhaps they can learn more about what Elora is about. Wareth nodded. Cray, please come here, Kilgren ordered. A large, blond-haired young man approached his King. Yes, M'Lord? Cray, gather a contingent of 10 soldiers and ride to Steria. See what you can ascertain about this girl and Vira, her alleged employer. You will be taking Wareth with you. Cray smiled. He had traveled with Wareth many times. Yes, M'Lord. He bowed, then he left the room with Wareth to prepare for the journey. Catira, my love, do you think this blight is caused by magic? he asked. Catira shook her head. My mystic training says no. This is a natural phenomenon. I am not trained in agriculture, but perhaps we should check with the elves to see if they have any ideas? Kilgren nodded. I should have checked with them first, he said. He sent word to the woods elves to the North. Then he looked at Catira. And now we wait. Wareth, Cray, and the 10 soldiers were soon on their way to Steria. The journey should take 4 hours on horseback if they travel at a steady gait. Wareth had met Cray many years ago, before Kilgren had become King and Catira was only a Mystic. Catira had found Wareth lost and confused in the woods. Cray had stowed away with them on that same quest. We shall be there before noon, Cray observed, and home before night. Wareth nodded. The village of Steria was located on top of a hill. It was a large village, bustling with activity. Wareth inquired about the whereabouts of Vira and was directed to the largest house in the square, just as Elora had said. When they had ridden to the house, Wareth raised a hand to the soldiers. Allow me to talk to the woman alone. We do not need to cause undue alarm, he said. Wareth then dismounted, handed the reins to Cray, and approached the house. A kind, older woman answered the door. Yes, she asked. Wareth smiled. Good afternoon, M'Lady, he said, bowing. I need just a moment of your time. Can you spare any? The woman nodded, opened the door fully, and said, please come in. Wareth entered the modest home and sat in the chair he was directed to. M'Lady, I am here seeking answers. Are you the one known as Vira? The woman nodded. She offered Wareth a cup of tea, which he took. After taking a sip, he proceeded. Does a young woman named Elora happen to be in your employ? Again the woman nodded, but this time there was a disturbed look on her face. Wareth could sense a little unhappiness. What can you tell me about the girl? Vira sighed deeply. That young thing is nothing but trouble. I can not trust her for anything. I will tell her to go to the market and pick up some fish, she returns and tells me there are no fish. I have had her followed and my other servants say there are plenty of fish, Elora just walks past them. She broke a plate and said the cat knocked it off the table. She forgot to tie up the horse and it ran off, and she told me the lead was broken. She told me it was snowing and the sun was out and the sky was clear. She told my husband one of his customers had passed away and the man came to call the next day. It is my opinion that she does not know the truth from fancy. Wareth nodded. He did not think he needed to check any further. This woman was not a witch and the girl was not reliable. Thank you, M'Lady, he said. He stood up from the chair and handed Vira the empty teacup. Thank you for the lovely tea and for your time. Is Elora in trouble? Vira asked. She did not come to work this morning and did not send word that she was ill. Wareth looked at the kindly woman. Elora is safe for now, he said. Wareth nodded, then left the house. Cray looked at his friend expectantly. What did you learn? he asked. Wareth sighed. The girl always lies. You can not trust much of anything she says. Wareth climbed onto his horse and turned it towards the castle. And now we must inform our King of this information. The contingent turned around and headed home. Kilgren was standing on the parapet when the group returned. He arrived at the courtyard just as the horses trotted in. He looked at Wareth's face and knew instantly the girl had lied to him. And Wareth knew instantly his King was aware. What did you learn on your quest for knowledge? Wareth dismounted from his horse and handed his reins to the stable boy. Cray joined them as they walked towards the main building of the castle. The girl is a notorious liar. I am surprised she retains her employment with that kind lady who is definitely not a witch. Kilgren nodded. Then we must teach this girl a lesson so she never tells a lie again, the King said. The King decided to hold court the next day and he invited Elora to attend. Elora arrived in court all cleaned up and in a lovely new dress. She curtsied happily to the king as he walked past her on the way to the dais. The mood in the room was light and gay. Suddenly the door to the room was flung open. A soldier stumbled into the room. He was covered in dirt and blood and his garments were ripped. He stumbled to the dais and fell onto the floor in front of the King. My God, what happened?! Kilgren exclaimed. He bent over the soldier and helped him up off the floor. I just returned from Steria, he gasped, I am the only one who made it back. Get this man some water, Kilgren ordered. He then turned his attention to the soldier. Pray tell, what transpired? The soldier was given some water, which he gulped down before continuing. We arrived at the village and it appeared peaceful enough. When we inquired about the witch, we were met with a blast of flame and wind. Gargoyles then began picking us off, one at a time. I barely managed to get past them, only to find myself face to face with the Witch. The one they call Vira. She threw some magic at me just as I threw my spear. I managed to kill her. When I turned to find my cohorts, they were all dead. Catira was watching Elora's face during this shocking display. The girl was terrified. She even attempted to leave the room but was intercepted by Cray. Catira left the dais and walked towards the girl. She gently put her hand on the girl's arm. Elora, where are you going? she asked. Elora's face was pale. Is she really dead? Is Vira dead? she asked Catira. Catira nodded. You said she was a witch, didn't you? Elora began to cry. No, she was not a witch, she sobbed. Vira was not a witch. I lied. Elora fell to her knees sobbing. And my lie killed her! At this time, the whole Court was looking at the girl and the Queen. Catira stooped down to the sobbing girl. Elora, your employer is not dead. We sent someone to talk to her and learned you have a habit of lying to people. So we decided to teach you a lesson. Words have consequences, whether they are the truth or a lie, they still have consequences. Elora nodded. I will tell the truth from now on, she sobbed. A cure was found for the blight shortly after, and Elora learned never to tell a lie again. The people in the Kingdom of Rockpence lived happily ever after."
The White dot,"The fresh autumn morning breeze swept across the flickering blades of grass and bent their spines to follow the rhythm of the natural air. The wind whispered in the hollows of the great trees of the forest as she rushed by, secrets of long forgotten times. She twirled in the empty air and grasped leaves in her fine grip and tossed them across the woodland floor. Acorns fell from the old oak as her shoulder brushed up against them, the nut tumbled down and rolled in concentric circles until halting as it ran out of energy, it lay there to rest.Out from the gaunt roots of the oak, tiny pine nutshell shoes emerged. Dainty, miniature feet enclosed in the casing of a pine nut inched out of tiny holes between the trees foundations and the earth. Attached to these delicate feet came pairs of honey suckle legs, soft and moist with the dew drops of the morning vapour. Then came tiny torsos[CB1], each enveloped in a small, elegant flower; buttercups, daisies, bluebells, and snowbells stepped into the pure sunrise light. Their bodices were coated with tiny poppy seeds and speckles of soil in ornate patterns and swirls like the wind herself. Their faces were as small as the acorn which had fallen moments before, their faces as delightful as the sweetest tree sap and their cheeks blushed like the petals of the reddest rose. Hair of tree bark brown cascaded down their backs as if rushing down the huge waterfall, some had small twigs or flower stems to hold their locks in buns and fishtails. As their bodies stood directly in the light for all too see they tip toed out of their homes further to reveal their wings. Their oak leaf wings fluttered and flapped, the colours of autumn echoed as they reflected the golden sunlight.The pixies rushed out to collect the fallen acorns, snapping their cupule off and rushing to the edge of the tree to collect the tree sap which trickled down its edge. Filled acorn caps strung along the diameter of the oak and tilted on its pivot as the air rushed past. Pixies gathered everywhere to sit and snack on dew drops and acorn bites, crisp seedlings were harvested to nibble on, and clean cut grass was clipped to serve as an appetizer. As they day dwindled by, the sun began to fall asleep and lay her head down beneath the horizon. The dim light of night was coming, but the pixies still sat on the woodland floor and nattered with their cheerful chirps.Down from the sky fell a small curled up white dot which effortless floated through the air and landed softly with a small thump onto the textured soil. The pixies darted behind fallen leaves, small pebbles and twigs which had been carelessly tossed by the wind. Their mud brown eyes peeped over their hiding places to observe the new phenomenon. The white dot detangled herself and sat up in a cross legged position. Her skin was a frost blue which was freckled with white dots and her hair was silvery white which hung crisp against her back like a starfish. Her body was surrounded in a beautiful white gown which rippled against her limbs, she stroked her face with fragile fingers while her ocean blue eyes clocked the speckles of brown which lay scattered behind leaves, pebbles, and twigs. She giggled.She stood up to her full height of three inches and spun around to absorb the surroundings and feel its touch. Looking about she saw the pixies begin to emerge from their shelter to creep towards their new acquaintance. She was different, she was unusual, she was curious. Why did she look like that?The pixies took this white dot and led her inside of their home, under the roots of this oak was where it was decided, the white dot would no longer be an outsider, she would learn how to become an autumn pixie. Over the next few days, the white dot learnt to harvest sap from the trees using a single acorn cap, to trim the emerald grass to the exact length needed to be able to peer out of in hiding and to find her way through the dimming light of sunset. But something wasnt quite right, she did what we was told, but she didnt feel as if she belonged.As those days flittered past she grew sad, what was her purpose? The white dot felt her feet begin to drag heavy on the forest floor, she began to shed tears and watched them trail behind her.The white dot slowly began to sink into the ground beneath her tiny, frosted feet, she began to melt away in the midday sun. She had worn a tulip petticoat, a poppy seed bodice, an acorn hat, and twigs in her hair, but why hadnt she felt like she belonged. As, she waited there, stuck in the ground, she couldnt help but feel lost and began to weep little dew drops once more.Night had come by the time she had ceased sobbing; it was colder and felt damp in the surrounding air. All the Pixies began to make for their root tip homes and settle down for the night. They lay their heads onto their moss pillows and cuddled down for a long nap.The white dot still waited outside; it was much colder now. Then all of a sudden, down from the sky came thousands of small white dots, cascading down like a shower of glitter. As their soft bottoms thumped the ground the snow pixies lifted their heads up and began to dance. The white dot collected her tears and rejoiced in the arrival of her family.

I thought I have done a good deed but later I realized it was a prank to kill an Owl for ugly people Every year, countless owls face a cruel fate at the hands of poachers who are catering to ignorance and misguided beliefs. Driven by religious myths and superstitions tied to them, these birds are poached for their body parts such as talons, skulls, bones, feathers, meat, and blood, which are then used in talismans, black magic, traditional medicines, etc. The superstitions surrounding owls in India are never-ending. For centuries, they have been associated with demon rituals, spooky tales, and folklore but at the same time, ironically, owls are considered to be the sacred mount of the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity, Lakshmi who is worshiped during Diwali, the festival of lights.These majestic birds are used in black magic rituals around the country as sacrificing them is believed to gain favor from the goddess. The domestic trade of owls is highly lucrative and it is appalling that the festival of Diwali is used as a front by traffickers to peddle endangered birds for monetary gain. Though the exact number of owls traded and sacrificed each year remains unknown, ahead of Diwali these incidents increase and take a more visible shape. The moral of the story is not to kill animals and birds they can never harm"
The Trickster of 2020,"Itd been one of those day. Not a single thing had gone right for me in 2020, and when I say not a single thing, that is not exaggerated. My mother lost her job (was forced out by a bunch of brown noser is technically more accurate), we sank pretty low financially. I was at a stand still and brain dead end with my novel (second draft, and only a whole lot of stress to show for it), my health was at a bad point in my life, and I had very little to look forward to at home. After I was chasing every mess at the company where I worked, and making very little headway on that front. My bedroom had a massive leak in the roof coming through the ceiling. Our chimney was missing bricks and the roof was missing shingles with holes in them. Our plumbing was backing up in the toilets and electricity outlets had failed. Every time I managed to stomp out one fire, another one would pop up somewhere else. To make it clear, I was cleaning up every mess in my path, and more kept on appearing.	To be serious, I was a nervous wreck, and felt like nothing was changing in my life and was falling down serval never-ending stairs.	So 2020 was a non-stop rock bottom to the bottom, but with time, all things must end. With gritted teeth and a lot of masks and toilet paper, we weathered our covid year, and came out the other side. My family restarted a wondrous entrepreneur career (you can check out in town). I managed to get a fresh perspective on my second book (finishing the last of my writings a few days ago), and we actually managed to squeak by on very little, and now are living okay. I even started making some headway in our new family business.	And yet I was still a nervous wreck. I still felt like I was falling down a never-ending flight of stairs.	I couldnt shake this feeling, but the bad was not over with us yet.	I had a dream a few months ago, when the dream fell on me. In my dream, I had come home to find my family in the setting room, sitting peacefully on the couch. The floor was in dead untidily scattered or dying animals and feces. I was aghast. What is all this?! I said, racing about, gathering up little mouse corpses and feces into a paper brown bag. 	And thats when I saw it. Out of nowhere, a small pink panther appeared, with a dead rat in its mouth, which it dropped on the rug, then vanished, only to reappear few minutes later with another, and another, and another. I ran around like psycho, scrabbling to pick all the dead vermin and feces into the bag, but the pink panther (with flesh like the skin of a pink flower petal) just kept popping in and out dropping more nasty things for me to pick up.	I woke up to the sound of my own snoring.	It was a day later my family had heard own Syfi visitor from this unwanted guest. In my dream, I was trapped in our bedroom with our pets, while a new terrifying panther had invaded our home. This little beast was covered in somebodys blood, and had fangs and claws made from fake keratin nails. The little brute was slobbering and jumping, hissing and slashing and doing what any panther from the underworld does in a dream. Meanwhile, my family had grabbed a bath towel and was trying to figure out how they could catch the creature, but never with any success.	All of us had been paid a visit by a trickster god, one which seemed to have been following our foot steps across the months of 2020.	Trickster gods have fallen out of time in the A.D. age. As with so many of the gods of antiquity, weve relegated tricksters to little more than fairy tales, or perhaps better know as fantasy literature and movies. We treat trickster gods as old comics, goofy clowns to the audience, harmless short-live which pass for imaginative diversion on television, computers and video games.	This is to our extreme disadvantage. Like much that once was, we are quick to use such things as superstition, the ridiculousness of a bygone era. How could someone believe a pink panther could change shape? How many people could believe a hare could carry messages between the faeries and the world of common men?	As long as there have been people, there have been tales of tricksters. Gods and fictional characters, they have always been with us in one form or another, since the beginning of man kind time.	Tricksters are mischievous characters throughout folk stories and myth which have a secret knowledge or power. They use their gifts not for evil, or for kindness, but for misshift. Tricksters use their powers to play pranks, to break the rules, to make misshift to everyone they feel needs too. This somebody can be any person, even the Divine. Tricksters are the original anarchists, the practical jokers, the internet trolls of the ancient world.	One thing we must remember about a trickster is that they are not evil, per say. Tricksters can be evil by our modern definition, but more often are simply enjoying the chaos that is created by them. Not for evil, but just for chaos. They enjoy breaking the rules, causing a great knight to fall as he s making a speech, tricking more powerful beings into doing things they ought not.	This character is so primal to our psyche, that virtually every culture has its own particular strain of the happy troublemakers.	The famed psychologist made of saw the Trickster as one of the primal stereo type of our mind, something fundamental to all human beings.	Anyone who belongs to a sub culture that seeks the perfect state somewhere in the past must feel very weird indeed when confronted by the figure of the trickster. He is a forerunner of the savior, and, like him, God, man, and animal at one time together. He is both subhuman and superhuman, a beastlike and divine being, whose chief and most alarming characteristic is his unconsciousness. 	Indeed, while the human species have gone out of our way as civilizations to distance ourselves from these mischievous beings, they are always with us in spirt, movies and books. We are no more able to remove them from our beliefs and symbols than our might that of the champion figure, the wise man, with a hero inside him/herself."
A PUERILE FOOL.,"Richard bought some cardboard papers and black permanent markers as he hurried to work. The rising sun cast a rosy hue across the morning sky, golden fingers of sunlight lit up the small town.Community volunteers swept and cleared dirt on the road, while few people moved about on the street, boarding taxis, and going about their days job. Shops were opened and signs that read NOW OPEN were put up in front of their glass pane doors. Richard gave little smiles to the familiar faces he saw as he flagged a taxi.Richard arranged his tie as he got down from the taxi, his reflection; a young and daring man with a styled and neatly combed brunette, dressed in a sky blue suit that matches the color of his eyes stared back sternly at him for some brief seconds. He smirked and rearrange his tie with his right hand while balancing his newly purchased items in a plastic bag on the right. He paid the driver and waved, the driver shrugged in surprise and drove off. Richard arrived work too early not because hes the most punctual male worker, he had something else up his sleeve. The reflectivity of the sun on the companys entrance glass doors couldnt match the slick glint in Richards eyes, re arranging his tie, he entered the building. Re arranging his tie was more of a habit, goes with his mood, whether he was nervous or trying to be cunning or even flirt!The company is a three-story building with 70% made of glass. It made the building glimmer and very beautiful.Today had a special mix in the air and thats because its the first day of April and April 1 is widely celebrated as fools day either you fool someone or get fooled and Richard wasnt ready to get fooled, he prepared something tricky for his co-workers.Richard entered his office which was on the second floor, open the windows to let in fresh air, arranged his table and set to work. Two hours past and Richard had set his April fools prank in motion. And in few minutes his co-workers resumed for the day. Richard had drawn black arrows facing different direction on the different cardboard papers he had earlier bought and wrote underneath them Nothing is actually wrong with the doors or elevators he placed the signs on, thats was the prank and its just meant for the day, the idea his co-workers think theres a fault in the elevators or electric doors and avoid them thereby follow the direction the arrows are pointing and use the stairs that will probably lead them to an entrance/exit and find another arrow leading them elsewhere. Its just like being in a maze and maybe later when therere some complains, he would pull down the papers and tell them its prank.Richard grinned and rub both palms together, his plan would go as planned and smoothly and when he would tell them it was his April fool prank and how they got fooled, they would all laugh about him and name him a tricky god. He planned doing more in the future.Good morning Mr. Richard A ladys voice greeted, he knew the owner and swiftly hid the scissor, markers and cardboard remains inside his desk drawers before looking at the lady that drew to a halt at his side. Miss Shirley, the Managing directors personal assistance.Her midnight black hair bounced over her shoulders and her lilac lips curled in a small smile as she squints her suspicious eyes at him. Shes petite and delicate-featured, pretty in a flawed, accessible way and also had a bubbly outlook. Her glossy skin matched her outfit; a pink collared button down shirt tucked in a suit skirt. Her straight legs stood well with the closed-toe loafers she wore. Richard returned her smile and relaxed on his chair. Morning sunshine flower he drawled looking his best, he arranged his tie and smirk at her. That was the least he could do to get her mind off his business. He wouldnt want someone spoiling his planned prank.She rolled her eyes at him already used to his flirty attitude. What are you up to? She asked using her eyes to motion to his desk drawer.Nothing that should concern you. Why are you here? Richard asked with a serious tone.I get it; you dont want me prying She chuckled gently Anyway I guess youve forgotten about the visit to Mr. Greens firm, the MD might or might not be waitingRichard sat up, of course hed forgotten and that was because he was too pre-occupied with the thoughts of pulling an awesome prank today.Good thing I came Shirley smirked and turned to go. Dont keep us waiting She said over her back and exited the office.Shit! Richard muttered the moment she left. Good thing she came, he thought as he grabs his documents, some pads and pen and hurried after her. Too bad he wasnt going to be present when the chaos starts and theres no time to pull down the posts.I wonder why half of the doors are under construction Shirley muttered to herself when Richard caught up with her. He simpered to himself. A young man about his age with grey eyes and rough stubble appeared from the right corner as they rounded the stairs on the left.Morning Jones! You owe me some stories when I get back Richard said to the young man.He was confused and asked what story in bewilderment. Richard only chuckled softly as they disappear from his sight. When the companys full and activities in top gear, Jones would understand what Richard meant.*****Mr. Brown, Richards MD got a call in the meeting few hours after they arrived Mr. Greens Firm. They were ten in the board room, a middle-aged man giving a presentation, Mr. Green, a man in his late seventys was amongst the people sitting, Mr. Brown sat at the far right corner of the rectangular shaped table with Richard on his left and Shirley on his right. Richard kept jotting some notes down. While Shirley was distracted with the urgent calls she had for the MD. Mr. Brown was trying to avoid causing distractions and concentrate. Mr. Brown frowned, straight lines outlined his forehead as Shirley gave him a look that read urgent!. Mr. Brown took the phone, bowed a little to excuse himself and left the board room.Mr. Brown came back minutes later, his forehead screwed in worry and little beads of sweat started gathering. He motioned Richard and Shirley with his eyes and they got the clue to leave, the presentation did not stop nonetheless. Mr. Brown took long strides to Mr. Greens seat and whispered some words, Mr. Green shared the same worry look Mr. Brown had as they shook hands.Richard and Shirley followed Mr. Brown behind as he exited the conference hall. The tension in the car on their way back to the company was as thick as a wet duvet folded into two.Shirley cleared her throat to ease the tension and finally asked. is there any problem Sir?Mr. Brown stared at her for some seconds and then stared at Richard, it was as if he was trying to process the question she asked and finally replied.The company is on fire. And I mean literallyAn electric shiver ran down Richards spine and Shirley held her mouth as she gasped in shock.  Oh my God! What happened? Richard asked himself aloud, there was no response. Nobody knew the answer. Not yet.Richard sulk in some breaths as their car approach the company, there was a very thick smoke from afar and red and white trucks came into view; Fire fighters truck and two ambulance trucks. Few cones were set around some entrances. Men in red and yellow stripes wearing facemasks connected by a hose to an SCBA (Self-contained breathing apparatus) came out of the smoking building helping one or two injured person to the ambulance for immediate care. While some men in bright yellow outfits were on the ladder of the truck holding water hoses and positioned it to where the fire roared and thick grey smoke rose.Mr. Brown, Richard and Shirley got down from the vehicle and approached the scene, rescue personnel wheeled a stretcher beside Richard and he saw Jones on it, Jones was badly burnt but his watered eyes were opened and he mouthed this is going to be a long story.Richard was told what happened by another co-worker.*****FLASHBACK*****Some worker arrived to work early morning to find some doors and elevator with sign post that read . It wasnt something new for the doors or elevators to be under temporary construction or brief malfunctions, but a little weird that almost all of them at once had defect. They had to use the stairs and sometimes bump into each other.The afternoon sun bathed the building in its warm light when somewhere in an office, a damaged switch sparked.The office was void of life and the little sparks kindled to fire and slowly spread to the stack of papers beside it. Before the fire alarm went off, there was a blazing mess of fire in the office and it spread to the next office.People started panicking and scrambling to safety. Some doors and elevators were in defect and these terrified people followed the arrows on the sign post hoping to see a successful way to exit the building. Some arrows led them to starting point.Smoke filled the building and some people started choking and coughing really hard, a stampede started as everybody rushed to escape the pandemonium. Many documents, systems and properties got burnt beyond repair and many people were injured from the stampede, broken glasses cut or fire burns.Fire fighters were able to rush to their rescue and so far there have been no record of death, just lots of casualties and damages.*****END OF FLASHBACK*****Richard face paled in guilt, he arranged his tie in for lack of air.He knew 80% percent of the damages were his fault, if he hadnt put up those signs, of course the repercussion wouldnt have been severe. Richards main concern is Mr. Brown and his company.Richard held his head in his palms wondering if the companys going to get back on their feet soon. This was one prank that totally went wrong and he regretted ever trying to pull a big one with every fiber in him."
Pause before passing the judgement,"Once upon a time in a jungle near the Nile , all the animals and birds lived happily and harmoniously.One day a crow named Kalu happened to pass from there. He was amazed to see that peace prevailed in such a big place.One bad habit of telling lies had already been proven disastrous for him. He had lost his family and friends and all relationships due to this one habit and he was kicked out of his own house by his family members.So he was searching a new place and wanted to build a new house and when he came across this jungle, he decided to live there.Parrot was the watchman and informed about anyone who came to the jungle and so when he saw the crow he straight away went to the lion's denParrot: "" O my king ! Lion please come out . I've a news , a strange crow has come in our jungle. ""Lion came out and opened his eyes wide and exclaimed: "" What!A strange crow ! But crows don't live here in this jungle.It has never been observed that the crows have lived here . They love the city areas . There they get cooked meals and many tasty dishes which are not available here at all. Please confirm your news and then come again. Go and look over and enquire as to why has the crow come.""Parrot:"" As the Mighty orders , shall be enquired. I'll do proper research and then come again with full information. Till then have a good day.""Parrot went away thinking about the whereabouts of the crow and decided to talk with him and get the required information.He met a monkey on the way and the monkey just started to chatter about the crow , he said: "" Dear parrot , you're the watchman of this jungle and you need to see who comes in it . A bad black crow has entered inside our territory and you're roaming about here and there, it's really irresponsible of you. And I have come to know from my resources that this crow is a very good liar.Our place is peaceful and happy and I won't tolerate anymischief done here . So please come with me to the lion and we'll talk about this.""Parrot: "" I understand you , my dear friend, I've seen the crow and I went to the lion to inform about this but he said to know the matter fully and then come to the conclusion.""Monkey : "" I know the matter and I'm coming with you , let's go. ""Parrot and monkey were going to the lion's den and on the way they met the cute little squirrel and she told them that she had seen a crow in their jungle . And said : "" My friend who lives in the city told me about one crow who has been caught telling lies without any reason.His family has thrown him out and he's searching another place . It is possible that this crow is that same one.""Monkey chattered: "" Yes this is that same one. ""Now the squirrel also joined them.On the way further, they met beautiful Peacock and told him about the crow .Peacock:"" Oh my God! What are you saying?We have to be careful not to listen to that crow at all and to maintain our harmony . I'm coming with you too.""All of them went to lion and called him . The lion came out and roared: "" what's all this noise about ? And dear parrot I told you to come to me after proper verification of your statement, then why have you come along so fast and that too with all of these?Parrot: "" Your majesty we are here to inform you about the truth of that crow. As we have come to know from our reliable sources that the crow is kicked out off from his house as ofhis habit of telling lies and that can even prove to be harmful and he doesn't realize his mistakes.So when his own family doesn't want to live with him, then why should we risk our lives ? We must kick him out of here now .""Lion paused for a long time and then calmly said : "" Listen to me , I'm concerned about all the members of our jungle from the smallest to the largest and as you all know that I'm kind and considerate so give me one chance to teach this crow a good life long lesson.""All of them agreed . The lion told the parrot to keep a watch on the crow and see that the crow doesn't come near his den as they were discussing the plan of action for teaching the lesson to the Liar crow.After the discussion all dispersed. The next morningthe cock woke up and to his surprise he saw that crow had been awake before him. He asked the crow: "" I'm supposed to get up first in the morning and what's the reason that you're awake at this time ? Here in this jungle everyone wakes up after my voice is heard and you have broken this rule so you need to be punished.I'll go and complain about this to the lion .""The crow said sadly: "" Go and complain and get me out of this jungle at once. I'm not scared of being kicked out from anywhere now as I have experienced it before and that has made me strong enough to handle all the odds. "" as he said this he began to cry loudly and his voice getting louder with the next sentence. Soon the animals and birds of the jungle came there as they heard the sad voice and they were deeply shocked to see the crow crying.Parrot asked : "" What's the reason for crying so loudly?Has anybody hurt you? Or something happened with you? ""Cock uttered: "" Nothing has happened.It's just the way God has made him to tell the lies and get mercy and make mischief thenafter. ""Squirrel interrupted: "" please,we need to listen to him first and please don't start judging him.We must have a kind ear towards all. We have been taught to be kind and merciful to each creature. ""Monkey jumped out from thetree and shook the tree on which the crow was sitting. The crow was completely shaken off by such movement.He was scared and that was seen from his face. He began to cry more louder and this time too loud that it reached the lion's den.The lion came out , roared and as fast as he could, he came to that place.He was concerned about the crow and he thought that someone might have hurt him and so he was worried.When he came he asked the reason and when he was told that the crow was nothurt at all and that the lion's instructions were followed strictly , he became angry and asked the crow the reason for creating such a situation in the early morning. The crow started his story : "" Your majesty, I have known from years that you're the world's most kind and generous king amongst all. I appreciate you and respect you and also that you have not kicked me out from this jungle.I am really grateful to you for giving me the shelter and allowing me to eat and drink as I wish . I wish that my family members too learn something from you and also the residents of the city area . If you allow me to tell my story ,I want to share my life story in the city. "" The lion agreed to listen and the crow started his story: "" Dear friend,I know that you all have believed in your friend's information which they provided you about me, but believe me it's the half truth. I'm not a liar , I have a good sixth sense ability to know the future and so I keep helping the people around me and when they are helped and saved, instead of thanking me, they blame me for misguiding them but never try to understand that I didn't let anything happen to them by warning them in advance. As they were warned , they took care and were saved from the tragedy. ""The lion asked him to go into detail of what he was trying to say . The crow began: "" I would like to show with an example for the better understanding.Suppose I see misfortune coming in the life of the parrots living here and then I warn them of the hunters and those who make the parrots their pets. So after knowing this , the parrots will definitely keep an eye around so as to save themselves and when they will see the hunters or any such people around they will definitely hide and won't come out until they see that the hunters have gone and now they are safe.Isn't it true Mr. Parrot? What would you do in such case? Please come ahead and tell. ""Parrot said : "" Yes we have to save our life we will hide and see what happens and we would definitely thank you as because of your sense of seeing danger saved us. But then why the city people and even your family doesn't understand such a simple thing.?""Crow: "" I explained them as I explained to you but they are biased and they only look for the bad things in all and not the good ones.""""But what is bad in this example? "" asked the lion.The crow answered: "" You have never visited the city area so you're not aware of their thinking patterns.They always see what has been wronged and not what is going right. As when I say don't eat that food as I have suspicion about that and they believe but when they don't get other food they blame me that because of me they have to remain hungry and that food could be eaten. And when they go there again the food is not seen so they say that someone ate and nothing happened and that also they have no idea who ate and where is he now and what happened but still they blame me forthat reason but never say that because of me they are still alive otherwise nobody knows what would have happened. ""The animals and birds of the jungle listened to the sad story and began to weep . The lion said to the monkey and the parrot: "" My dear friends monkey and parrot you need to go to the city with the crow and explain this simple fact to them. ""The crow took the monkey and parrot with him to his house and knocked the door. The door opened and when they saw the crow they all tried to push him away saying : "" You unlucky crow , you spoiled our lives . You just never stop telling the lies and harassing people and why have you come again?Go get out of here. We don't want to see your face at all. "" The parrot interrupted: "" May I come in ? "" The crow's family asked why had he come with the crow?The parrot replied: "" Please listen to me,as you all have faith in God so do we have and just tell me one thing that whenever this crow tells you about something bad that may happen in your life, don't you believe him? "" they said : "" Yes we do but now no more of that.""Parrot said :"" The crow just wants you to save from the troubles and you also get saved. But after that you blame the crow for telling lies because nothing bad happened with you. So do you want that something must happen in order to be proved that the crow is telling the truth? ""They said : "" What do you mean?"" Monkeypeeped from the hole and said :"" Here I am, I'll destroy your nest.Do whatever you can to save yourself.""They were scared and thought that the monkey will really destroy their nest so they flew away to another tree with the kids.The parrot went to the tree with them and said : "" Look , the monkey didn't destroy the nest . Now it surely means that he was telling a lie and so he must be punished and also to prove that he is telling the truth he must compulsorily destroy your nest and then you'll believe that the monkey is a true person. Isn't it?""The parrot went to the tree with them and said : "" Look , the monkey didn't destroy the nest . Now it surely means that he was telling a lie and so he must be punished and also to prove that he is telling the truth he must compulsorily destroy your nest and then you'll believe that the monkey is a true person. Isn't it?"""" Oh my God!""exclaimed all . They realized their mistake and felt sorry and asked for forgiveness and the crow did forgive them.They all thanked the parrot and the monkey for making them realize where they were wrong and that too in a civilized manner.Then they came to the jungle to say special thanks to the lion for reuniting them with their family member and teaching a good lesson kindly to them.Moral: Before passing a judgment , stop for a while, listen attentively and try to understand what others are telling. Be slow , kind and considerate so that your misunderstandings do not ruin your relationship."
My Little Wildflower,"The gravedigger felt bad for the little girl with the wild red curls. She wore a ragged brown dress, embroidered all over with vines and flowers, and clutched a quilt tightly around her shoulders as she looked down into her fathers grave. The gravedigger himself was shivering, but giving her the quilt that he kept in the shed with his shovels seemed the least he could do. He had four children with a fifth on the way, and could scarcely afford to put shoes on all of their little feet. If he took in all of the orphaned children whose parents he buried, he would have not a crumb to feed any of them. He could only hope she had an aunt or a kindly neighbor to take her in. She didnt, of course.Aside from the girl, the only mourner in attendance of the widowers funeral was a large owl, which sat in the tree above their heads and occasionally flew down to perch on the girls shoulder and nuzzle her cheek or pick at her hair. The gravedigger thought this was strange, of course, but the animals in this town had been behaving strangely for the past decade or so, and it was not uncommon to use birds for hunting. Usually falcons or hawks, but an owl didnt seem to far of a stretch. People are like that, you see; they will look for any excuse to avoid seeing what is right in front of them. In the end, the dead man, Vadim, was covered with dirt a trio of yellow daffodils the girl had found God-knows-where, what with the ground being frozen, placed above him, the gravedigger folded his quilt, put away his shovels, and went home to his wife and children. The strange little girl with the wild red curls was just another orphaned child, none of his concern.The girls name was Katya, and the owls name was Greya. Katya didnt have a mother; she had died not long after Katya was born, so Katya was raised by the gentle hand of her father. Every morning, when Katya woke, Vadim braided her hair carefully and tied it with a little green ribbon. Every day at noontime, the braid had come mostly undone, the curls flying about her head like a fiery halo. She would hand Vadim her ribbon, and he would shake his head and smile to himself.  he would say.In the evenings, when Katya was exhausted from a long day spent foraging for herbs with her father to sell at the market, Vadim would sit in an old rocking chair before the fire. Katya would clamber up onto his lap, and the rocking of his chair, the feel of his fingers combing through her curls, the rough sandpaper of his voice, would lull her to sleep before she even closed her eyes.When Katya was very small, she went to school for three short weeks. Her father was a craftsman and a forager; he collected herbs in the spring and summer, carved childrens toys and spun clay pots in the forest and winter. Katya could hold a whittlers knife before she could walk. Vadim didnt have much money, but he rarely needed to purchase much of anything aside from finely woven cloth and thread. Everything else could be made, found, or done without. He could write his own name, shakily, but legibly enough, and he could read simple words, when he needed to. There was no question of what Katya would do when she was grown. She would be a forager, potter, and carver, as Vadim before her and his father before him, unless she married, in which case she would raise children. This was how it worked in those times. If your father was a farmer, you would be a farmer. If your father was a doctor, you would be a doctor. As Vadim wasnt a scribe, teacher, or record-keeper, it wasnt necessary that Katya learned to write, but Vadim wanted her to make friends and be with other children. He knew she wouldnt, not unless forced; as she would much rather spend her days in the forest collecting mushrooms.Katya was seven years old that first day of school; and, for that matter, the last. She sat in the back of the classroom, tying and untying knots with her hair ribbon, doodling flowers on the desk with her chalk when the teacher wasnt looking. She learned to write  in big, sloppy letters on her slate. She didnt talk to anyone, nobody talked to her, and that was just fine, until the day the older boys took notice of her.It was recess, and Katya had just pulled a particularly juicy apple from her pocket. She alighted atop a stump at the edge of the schoolyard, content to kick her boots in the dirt, listen to the birds sing, and watch the other children play. Three boys, maybe nine years old, each at least a head taller than Katya, were following a group of girls in dresses around, making kissing noises. They were not afraid of the opposite sex, and proud of the fact. The girls would stick their tongues out, squeal, and run away giggling, and it went on like that for ten minutes or so, until the boys grew tired of chasing, and went off in search of an easier-to-catch target. A large, sandy-haired one, clearly their leader, spun in a slow circle, a fox in the henhouse, selecting its prey. As his eyes came closer and closer to Katyas stump, she busied herself with cleaning her apple on her apron. Unfortunately for her, Katya was unknown, and the sandy-haired boy wanted a new game to play.The boys came gallivanting up to Katya, and a brown haired one snatched her apple, taking a huge bite out of it. He let out a loud groan, juice dribbling down his chin. Katya just looked at the ground, refusing to make eye contact. A tall, almost twig-like boy with brown skin and short black hair reached out, pulling one of her curls and letting it bounce back like a slingshot. She gave no response, hoping they would grow bored, as they had with the other girls.Youre really not very fun, you know, said the sandy-haired boy.Yeah, come on, lets go find something else to eat, agreed the tall one.Or, we can try to get her to play with us, snickered the brown haired boy, and shoved Katya on to her bottom. She landed awkwardly, a small pebble directly under her tailbone, and felt her lower lip tremble slightly.she thought furiously,Katya blinked again and again, determined not to let the tears spill over, but felt a hot wetness on her cheek and knew her body had betrayed her.Aww, widdle babys crying! one of them mock-whined, kicking dirt onto her dress and laughing. Katya was done being pushed around. She looked up into their faces and opened her mouth, prepared to say so, but was shocked to see their eyes widen. She looked down at their feet, where roots that had been dead just a minute ago had turned green and hooked about their ankles, sending them crashing into an awaiting thicket of thorn bushes. A chorus of laughter rose from a semi-circle of schoolchildren who had gathered to watch. Katya rose to her feet and looked down to see her tormentors faces still pale with fear.! they cried, witch! Shes a monster! She cursed us! but Katya had already spun on her heal and run from the schoolyard for the last time, still echoing in the distance. They had no idea how close theyd come to the truth, and neither did Katya.Katya ran and ran, faster and farther than shed ever run before. She heard the flapping of wings above her, but didnt look to see what was following her. In fact, she didnt look anywhere, the world was just flashes of green and brown. She didnt know where or how far she was going, had no destination in mind. Thistles caught at the hem of her dress, tearing the thin material. Branches caught at her hair, streaking mud across her face. She ran until her lungs ached and her feet were numb, her socks soaked and muddy from splashing through a stream. Only then did she let herself collapse at the base of a large oak tree. Only then did she let herself sob. A large white owl landed in front of her, its head quirked to the side as it examined her tattered clothes, her muddied face. The owl did a funny little dance-like hop until it sat beside her, almost as tall as she was, and craned its neck to pick twigs out of her hair, letting out low, comforting sounds from its throat. This is the story of how Katya met Greya.Now, after weeks of begging Vadim to take a bite of stale bread or drink a spoonful of broth, Katyas father was dead. Vadim had never known about Greya. To him, she was just a strange owl that had taken to perching atop his thatch roof. Whenever he mentioned it, his daughter smiled, as if recalling a delightful secret, so he didnt mind. He had no idea that the strange owl sometimes flew through a window Katya had left open for it at night, when it was too dark for Vadim to see, or that it comprised the other half of Katyas universe, aside from himself. But now, Vadim was gone, so as Katya looked around the kitchen of her childhood home, taking in the details in broad daylight, Greya sat atop the table, preening her feathers. Katya was fourteen, she had no reason to stay in this old house, and it felt so empty without he Das rumbling laughter. So shed taken her fathers canvas gathering bag and loaded it with an extra dress, her fathers hunting knife, and a set of nesting dolls hed made for her as an infant that she couldnt bear to leave behind.Katya slung the bag over her shoulder, whistled for Greya, and slipped out the door.. Goodbye, house, she whispered, resting her hand on the doorframe, goodbye, Da.When Katya and Greya were bored, or when they wanted a snack, their favorite game had always been a devious one. They would follow their noses, searching for the houses that smelled of fresh bread or spice cookies. Greya would let out a shriek, swooping into henhouses and stirring up a ruckus. Katya would hide in a bush or behind a tree, watching as someone ran to the chickens, yelling, often without shoes, before slipping inside to claim her prize. By the time the poor baker noticed that half the pastries were missing, Greya and Katya had already long since clambered up a tree, Katya giggling, her face covered in sugar and cinnamon.Now, the girl and the owl trekked through forests and across rivers, stopping at villages to steal bread from unsuspecting families, eating rosehips and huckleberries when there were no villages for miles. Katya would sit on a sun-warmed rock, embroidering flowers over the holes she frequently put in her dresses, and Greya would sing low melodies, the girls voice weaving through in high tremors. Animals came from far and wide, prey curled beside predators, their prejudices put aside in favor of a delightful nap bathed in sunlight and harmony. Katya, at long last, had come home.So, my darlings, if you ever count your cookies again and again, only to find one missing, or hear beautiful music from deep within the forest, or see a rabbit asleep in the fir of a fox, smile, and call out to Greya and Katya, for they have come home."
The Woods' Whisperer,"What if trees could talk? How many wonders do you think lie there? How many secrets have people whispered to the woods and how many secrets have actually been heard?Theres an old legend in my hometown, how old? you would ask, as old as the old wood.A man that grew up as a tree, he would not speak in the language you and I are talking right now, nor move, he just laid there under the good sun, and at night he would walk between the trees, you would mistake him for a pine or a cedar, not a baobab, he's slim like the trunks of the darkest trees. You could walk past him and never notice, but then realize the pine is moving. Son of a very young lady and a very violent man, he was left in the forest, left to die, alone with no one else, a newborn, yet he lived to be of very old age. That I know, the story has been around before the eldest man was born, the Whisperer must not humane, perhaps his father was an old god or his mother a nymph, or maybe he was granted the gift of longevity. They say once two siblings got lost in that ocean of trees, someone whispered the way out, it was believed to be one of those creatures, you know? Those faes, or even spirits, someone from the other world. But it was none of that, that voice was the woods whisperer, that man I told you about. It has happened more than once, a group of scouts, a couple that got lost in their way to a camp center, he's always there, he perdures. Nobody knows how he survived, for as long as his will lives on, it must remain a secret, thats a story he keeps to himself. How people know about him then? Some claim to have seen a tree with eyes, some claim to have seen a man standing still in the place where sunlight touches the treetops, some claim they must have hallucinated his image due to being extremely frightened. Me? Oh, hes real, real but greatly exaggerated.The most popular song about that legend is one that went something like:A bit repetitive, not a piece of poetry but its a popular song in these towns, that's just part of the chorus, you can ask the kids on the river town nearby for the full song. Based on that song trees actually raised the whispered to be like them, to settle roots, to grow leaves entangled in his beard, to stand still, and to listen to what the woods have to say.There are three rules for entering the woods: first, always follow the path, or you might get lost in the woods. Second, dont turn around, if you do you are gonna start doing it and you are gonna put your panic in the hands of the wood, weve lost too many to paranoia. And third, if you hear the breeze making its way through the trees, listen, listen because it might be the whisperer and that means that you are lost and helpless at this point. Those are the three- you know what? Im actually going to put a fourth one there, when youve finally gotten out of the woods, say thank you maybe he didnt help you at all, but the woods do not pardon anyone with freedom, if you made it, you received some help, some kind, and it should always be welcomed.But he does not only help lost villagers, several times have people with much richness come to us, talking of opportunities and economy, we people from the river never cared much about that cursed paper that makes people forget they are supposed to act like people, not like the flower that does not grant the woods its beauty by not blooming. Of all of us, he, the one that never felt too much like a human, was the one that did the most for us, he would go around the forest making the axes incapable of cutting through wood, or making those big land crushers fail and burn themselves to ashes. He lives for the woods, its his home, maybe its even part of him, well never know, oh man of the trees, wonderful specimen rejected by the creation, what secrets have your leaves heard.About him, he knows everything, but boy don't ask him questions that have never been answered, there's a reason for their absence, there's a reason some mysteries must remain mysteries, if we knew half the things he guards, we'll know too much, he guard what's been said in the woods, what trees knows, because it would be too much for us, and why would a simple mortal like you want to know everything? There's no way we'll take it, we cannot pursue his knowledge. It is rumored that he learned the language of the trees, his fathers, the rumor from the flowers, his mothers, and the whisper from the wind itself. He speaks to them in a language we have not listened before, and one that we'll never understand. Some say he is the heir to the woods, the son of Mother Earth, some that he actually wants to lure us into the depths of his woodland, some that he's not real and a product of scared foreigners' imagination.But boy, legends are just that, bedtime stories to keep people out of the area, there will be a time when the Whisperer will become a myth, the songs will be forgotten, and his existence will get lost in time. Now I won't entertain you more, go sleep and in the morning you'll leave. Oh, and another thing, just because, don't forget to say thank you on your way out."
The Linden Tree,"The Linden Tree stood hollow at the center of the village square. She had seen many generations of farmers and their families gather under the shade of her fluttering leaves. The village of Chamarandes was nestled along a portion the Marne River. Its few houses stood in the Rivers valley. The land was green and lush, with cow pasture land and bordered on all sides by hilly temperate forests of deciduous trees, a few conifers thrown in at random.The Linden Tree felt alone in her cobblestone square, longing for the company of other trees. It was a hollow feeling not to have other tree friends. She longed to intermingle her roots with others of her kind. She wished for more than squirrels and mice and birds for company! Oh, the humans played and danced around her on May Day, threading ribbons into her limbs, their blood hot with the immemorial pagan rites of Spring, not forgotten in spite of the Roman invasion and the arrival of Catholicism in all of France. She had seen many a couple born under the shade of her whispering leaves. A grey-stoned Catholic Church stood nearby, a bell tower ringing out the hour and reminding the Linden of how long the hours really were and of how many years, decades and centuries she had stood there alone. She recalled her childhood day.She remembered how the builders had started building that tiny choir and transept stone building as the 15 century turned over a new leaf into the 16 century. She was but a seedling then, grown from a seed dropped into the village square by a busy magpie and unnoticed by the farmers at first. More than one such human had attempted to uproot her, but she had grown deep roots and shot up about a foot per year. Eventually, men had given up after one of them suggested that Linden trees were good shade in the hot summer. The villager had even named the square after her: Place du Tilleul or Linden Square, as the American soldiers lodging in the nearby Chteau des Escholiers had called it during the War to end all Wars. John J.Pershing had loved to sit under her shade and write letters home to his family. He looked so dashing in his uniform!War years were always times of sadness for the villagers. May Day came and went without ribbons in her branches, without young blood dancing in her shade. The men, old and young, had gone to war against the German invaders. The Church building had grown bigger during the reign of Louis-Philippe during the second quarter of the 19 century when an architect named Antoine Chaussier who lived in nearby Chaumont had rebuilt the church in its current cross shape after a fire had gutted the original building. He was responsible for that clock tower that had damned the Linden Tree into always knowing what time it was, and how long she had stood there.It was at the end of World War I that a mischievous spirit named Laurel decided to take residence in her trunk. The hole it bore inside the trunk was tiny at first. As Laurels needs for space grew, so did the hollow in the tree. The Linden did not mind. She now had company. Laurel told her tale of Ancient Greece, of Rome. She had lived even longer than the Linden herself. She had brought Spring to faraway lands when Chamarandes was locked in icy winter. While the physical hollow grew, the Linden felt fuller than she had in centuries.It was then that Jean, a farmer whose family had tilled the land for generations in Chamarandes carved a heart into the Lindens bark. It bore his initials along with those of Nellie, his sweetheart from the nearby village of Choignes. Nellies father was a good-for-nothing drunk. Jeans parents did not approve in the slightest of his union with a drunkards daughter. She must be a gold-digger! She had to be desperate to escape the abuse of her childhood home and to elevate herself by marrying rich! Can you not see that you are marrying down? his mother Madeleine bemoaned. You have not survived this awful war only to come home and give your heart to the first strumpet that strikes your fancy! his father shouted at him.Rumors abounded that he was only planning to marry Nellie because she was already with child. Nellie could not stand this gossip-mongering crowd of farmers. As if her life were not already difficult enough at home, tending to every detail of the household and to her siblings while her mother did the work of two in the fields, stooped and aged prematurely by years of childbirth and marital abuse. She traced the heart shape on the Linden tree and her initials and Jeans. She was not pregnant as the gossips claimed. She and Jean had chosen to wait until they were married. She was still a virgin. She knew that she was pure, so the gossip hurt twice as much as if she and Jean had given in to their impulses not to wait until they were married. Making a wish, she tied her best handkerchief, which she had embroidered with her monogram, to one of the Linden branches, near the hollow in the trunk.Jean hated the gossip because it hurt his beloved Nellie. He wondered if he would ever get his parents to change their mind and consent to their union. He thought his absence from home and the fact that his mother had pined in worry while he served in the trenches would help her change her mind about Nellie. His folks were, more than ever, adamant that he needed to marry up, not down. They found every opportunity to invite single girls they thought more worthy of their boy to visit their home. How embarrassing it was to have them show off their rich land and farm, and to hear them point out how worthy a prospect he was!As Madeleine, took her seat on a bench under the Linden with the other village gossips, she argued with them that they had no proof her sons marriage plans were due to his girlfriends being with child. She could see their eyebrows rising in disbelieving looks. The more she tried to convince them that her boy was undefiled and still pure, they chuckled, We saw the way he held onto Nellie when the May Day dances resumed last year! And he tied a May pole to her window! Can you believe it? The Drunkards daughter, with a May pole, when my daughters window remained empty? Madeleine got mad. Words were exchanged that she could not take back about Marguerites ugly daughter and how it would take a miracle for her to ever get married. Marguerite rose to her full height, harrumphed and stuck her knitting back into her basket, heading home without another word.Och thought Madeleine Me and my fat mouth! I may just have lost my one true friend! She debated chasing her down and apologizing, but held back. It would be better to let her cool off first. She would apologize the next day. She leaned backwards, her head against the Lindens trunk. Was that a knocking sound inside? Startled, she looked around. Was someone on the other side of the tree trying to play a trick on her? Madeleine stood up, walked all the way around the trunk. She was alone. She studied the bark carefully, sighing when catching sight of the heart shape in the trunk with the initials J and N. Was that a firefly on the trunk? No the glow seemed to emanate from inside the trunk Madeline crossed herself quickly, but even though she felt a bit of apprehension, she stuck her eye against the hole in the tree and peered in.A green figure appeared to be dancing inside the trunk and seemed quite oblivious to her observer until she twirled to face Madeleine and stared right at her. Oh! they both exclaimed at once. Are you a fairy? a disbelieving Madeleine asked. The mischievous spirit of Spring replied, I am the Spirit of Springtime. Though some would call me a Fae in Ireland, I prefer to think of myself as a Goddess. Madeline crossed herself again. She looked around, tightened her shawl around her shoulders, and declared, Are you the wishing kind of Fairy? If so, I have but one wish! Not for gold or riches! I want my Jean to forget about Nellie and to marry someone even richer than he is! Laurel seemed to consider that for a moment, then answered, I will see what I can do for you. For the next two weeks, I will need you to place an offering of what you value most within the Linden Trees hollow, and I promise your son will marry a wealthy girl. Come every night at Midnight, with a sacrifice to me, and you will get your wish!Madeleine went home, shaken, but determined to save her son from this girl she despised. She told her husband Pierre about her encounter with the Linden Fairy. Dont be daft! he replied, Fairies dont exist! Madeleine dragged a bewildered Pierre to the tree to prove she was not imagining things. Laurel had started dancing again, a golden glow about her in the hollow of the tree. Now, do you believe me? Madeline triumphed. Pierre swallowed hard, nodded, and the two farmers returned home to gather an offering for the Linden Fairy. They promised to return at Midnight.The Lindens leaves chuckled and she asked Laurel how she meant to grant the Farmers wish. Laurel laughed outright, and said, Just having a bit of harmless fun. I stirred Jeans blood when he danced around the Maypole with Nellie. He WILL marry Nellie or my name is not LaurelNight after night, Pierre and Madeleine returned, clutching a gold Louis each, and depositing it deep down in the hollow, then covering the offering with twigs arranged to look like a birds nest so as to hide the fortune. Little by little, the life savings Pierre had carefully hidden in a wool sock under his mattress, wound up inside the hollow of the tree. He did have doubts, but feared voicing those out loud to Madeleine. By the 14 midnight, the couple had but two gold coins left in their woolen sock after their last delivery to the Linden Fairy.Under the cover of darkness, Laurel gathered the offered coins into Nellies embroidered handkerchief. She lugged the coins all the way up to the crest of the hill that separated Chamarandes from Choignes. She was grateful when she reached the ridge. It was all downhill to Choignes from there! She paused near the stone calvary cross that overlooked the valley, halfway between the crest and the village of Choignes and buried the treasure a foot deep under that monument. To mark the spot, she placed tiny silex stones arranged in a circle, and placed a posy of violets inside the circle. To anyone passing by, this would look like someone had offered a prayer to Jean-Baptiste de La Croix de Chevrires de Saint-Vallier, to whom the cross and the Church down in Chamarandes were dedicated. Laurel was not done with her nighttime mischief though. She made her way from byre to byre in Choignes and so scared the dairy cows with her antics that their milk dried up! Finally, tired beyond belief, she trekked back to her Linden hollow, and fell asleep as soon as her head landed on the feathers in her nest.Nestled in under her goose feather quilt in the tiny cottage she shared with her father and mother and seven younger siblings, Nellie had a restless night. Her dreams were so vivid that night. They were peopled with a green fairy-like creature, and images of the Vallier Calvary and of bouquets of violets. The word, Dig! came back again and again in her dreams. She felt more tired when she woke up and cooked breakfast for her family than she had when she had gone to bed the previous night. When she went to the farm to pick up a barrel of milk for her hungry siblings, there was none to be had. She came home empty-handed to an already drunk father. I dont care if you have to walk all the way to Langres to get milk! he shouted, Now, go and get milk so this infernal baby brother of yours will shut up! And dont come back empty handed, you hear?Nellie set out, milk barrel swinging on her arm, for the long trek to Chamarandes. Upon reaching the Saint Vallier Calvary, she pulled out her handkerchief and mopped her forehead. A playful wind snatched the cloth out of her hand, and it fluttered down to the ground. As she was bending to pick it up, she noticed the fairy circle, with its posy of violets inside it. The dream! Dig! She lifted the bouquet to her nose to smell the enticing fragrance and noticed that the ground beneath it looked freshly tilled. Feeling a bit foolish for doing so, she dug. From experience, she knew how hard the limestone riddled land was to dig, so she felt encouraged in her effort by the ease with which she was able to dig. Cloth? She tugged and pulled out a bundle that jingled. She recognized the handkerchief by the carefully embroidered monogram. When she opened it, 28 gold coins tumbled into her aproned lap. She could hardly breathe! She could not keep such a treasure, could she?Upon arriving in Chamarandes, she made her way up the steps to the tiny City Hall above the elementary school. She placed her handkerchief on the mayors desk and explained how she had come by her discovery. The mayors eyes were as big as saucers. He examined the coins and the handkerchief. Pointing out the embroidered monogram on the dirty handkerchief, he asked, Arent those your initials? Nellie nodded and sheepishly explained that on May First, she had tied this self-same handkerchief on the Linden Tree and had made a wish. The mayor said, Well, I have no idea who your benefactor is, but it looks like you just came into a fortune! Since this is your handkerchief, whatever it contains is also yours by rights! Nellie stared in disbelief, Mine? She tucked her newfound wealth into the deep pocket in her apron, and immediately went to Jeans farm to ask if she could buy milk for her siblings. Jean was delighted to see her, yet puzzled as to why she would travel all the way to Chamarandes to get milk when Choignes had more dairy farmers per capita than Chamarandes did. Her eyes glistening with tears, Nellie reached into her apron pocket and opened the bundle of coins for Jean to inspect. Jean laughed and laughed and laughed, and when he caught his breath, he exclaimed, It looks like you are richer than I am now! I get to marry and heiress!Later that evening, Madeleine and Pierre headed out to the Linden Tree at Midnight. They asked the Linden Fairy for their boon. Laurel replied that their son had fallen in love with a rich heiress, and that he would be married three weeks later, after the banns had properly been posted on the doors of Saint Vallier Church in Chamarandes and Saint Martin Church in Choignes for three consecutive Sundays. When a suspicious Madeleine wondered out loud, An Heiress? Choignes is full of peasants and farmers, like our village. What is the name of our sons future bride?, Laurel replied, Her name is Nellie and your son has been in love with her for several years now! Incensed, Madeleine and Pierre yelled at the Fairy that a deal was a deal, and that they wanted their money back. Laurel shrugged her arms and shoulders and told them that Nellie had come into a fortune. You wished for your son to marry someone richer than you were, and he will! My part of the bargain is fulfilled!Pierre reached into the Lindens hollow, hoping to retrieve his coins below the nest, but they were not to be found. Angry, he scraped at the bottom of the hollow, thinking that maybe the coins had fallen in the crack. Meanwhile, Madeleine ran back home to get a digging tool for her husband. Most of the night, they tried to dig at the Lindens hollow, making Laurels home a mess of wood shavings. They went home tired and empty handed by dawn, as the first villagers started opening their homes shutters. Laurel apologized to her friend the Linden for the wound the angry couple had dug. The Linden chuckled, Oh, it was SO worth it just to see their red sweaty faces!Jean and Nellie were married and moved to the top of the hill between teh villages, on a big patch of land. One of their their grandchildren was named Laurel, though no one in the family had ever born that first name. The child in question had golden hair the color of Linden seed pods. She loved the color green. Her favorite flower was the violet and she used to bring posies of violets to her grandmother Nellie when they were in season. Most of all, Laurel loved the hollow Linden tree on the main square of her village. She often played in the hollow of the Linden tree. She loved to have tea parties with empty acorn cups and water from the squares fountain. It was then that the Spirit of Spring bid her goodbyes to the Linden Tree, knowing a new Laurel was now taking care of the tree and that it would never feel alone again."
All My Friends Aren't Real,"Oh Daphne, Im going to miss you most of all, said Sarah. The crowd of fairy tale creatures appeared entirely content with this preferential sentiment because, well, it was Daphne, and Daphne and Sarah had become close friends, inseparable, were it not for the sanctimony of Grown-ups. It had taken Daphne a long time to become accustomed to Sarahs  coexistence in The Garden. Two weeks it took, which in fairy tale time signifies a lifetime. Daphnes paper thin wings flittered behind the leaf of an overhanging fern. She had long ago gotten used to Sarah's patient and persistent presence in The Garden. Daphne was no longer afraid, but she was angry that Sarah had to leave. Not angry at Sarah herself, because she loved Sarah. Daphne was angry at the circumstances that would be taking her best friend away and she had no other place to put that anger. Please dont be angry at me, Ill be back as soon as I can. Come out from behind there.But Daphne remained hidden, playful and petulant, fluttering and frowning. Harmless as the eraser at the end of a pencil, the ground beneath Daphne moved and through the tiny mound of dirt appeared a fairy tale creature called Ben, a wise and kind worm. With contented grumbles he shook his head and the sand from behind his spectacles disintegrated onto the ground. The  gritty sand  in his mouth he spat out. After a brief apologetic contemplation at the scene around him he assured Daphne, Go to your friend Daph. If you dont say a proper goodbye youll feel awful. There's not much time. Her anger instantly forgotten, Daphne whirred over to Sarah. By way of showing her regret and affection she fluttered lightly over Sarahs cheeks, down her throat and onto her forearms, tickling the scars she wore there; tiny slices, indiscernible, but for the lighter shades of pink against her natural complexion.Fairy Tale Kisses, Sarah called  the thin breeze from Daphnes whispering wings. The sensation had helped those scars heal, as well as the pain that caused them. Ben, being a worm, had no arms or hands and yet, unfailingly, he carried a book with him whenever he popped his head out. With his invisible hands he shook the book free of the dirt between the pages and as if reading from a sacred text he ceremoniously declared:Sarah,Be brave and always remember us. We will all be here when you return. Tears rolled down Sarahs cheek and with wind, light as dandelion breath, Daph fluttered about her face drying the remaining tearspooled inside Sarah's burning eyelids.My dear and wise Ben, I could never forget any of you. A harsh retort cut the air when Robert scoffed, What rubbish!Calmingly from Ben, Easy there, Robert,No! Shouted Robert. Its true! Shell come back all grown-up and she will have un-learned The Gift. All children start with it and then they forget. Always do! The Gift started early with me, much earlier than Mother. You said so yourself, remember Ben? Ill come back with grand stories to entertain you all just like first day of school. Remember you thought I would loose The Gift then too Robert? A mumble of agreement hushed the cramped motley gathering of fairy tale creatures.Curtains parted at the window of the house. Mother could barely discern the silhouette of her daughter through the ferns.  Mother hung her head forlornly. Sarah! Came Mothers trumpeted cry. Its time to leave. Daphne zipped behind her fern.""Don't be scared Daph. Mother doesn't come down to The Garden anymore,"" assured Ben.  I wont forget you Robert. How could I forget the person who taught me to pull the meanest mean face at my school. And Sarah growled heartedly and bared her teeth fully. Robert, instantly regretful of his ungracious behavior replied, thats my girl! He responded with his own ferocious growl, an advantageously practiced roar! Daphne, after attempting to reemerge from her hiding place, zipped behind her fern once again. As is the habit of hummingbirds, Rainbow Humming Bird magically appeared, above them and by way of her vibrating wings oscillated the words, Quiet. Someone's coming. Sure enough there appeared a man hurrying down the steps that led from the back of the house to The Garden. Look Ben! Declared Robert excitedly ""It's Freddie all grown up"", nudging Ben with his sharp elbow,  hard enough for the glasses in front of Ben's eyes to fall to the ground. Instantly embarrassed, Robert retrieved the glasses, blew the dirt off as best as his little lungs could afford and subsequently, rather hastily, shoved them back onto Bens face. By way of added amends he picked up Bens book, dusted it off with his sleeve and replaced it into Bens invisible hands. Optimistically Ben replied, My word! Indeed it is!  He was one of my best students, Robert claimed proudly. Though, not as fierce as you Sarah.  Didnt they call him Fierce Freddy? inquired Ben encouragingly. Yes! Shouted Robert. Thanks to my training!  Rainbow  buzzed her wings, Hes nearly here.Bens bespectacled face softly submerged itself into the earth and his hole filled with dirt. Hi Sarah, Freddy friendly as ever, announced when he arrived into the clearing. Do you remember me? After nearly replying, Hi Fierce Freddy, Sarah said, Hi Freddy. Comically, Freddy appeared more nervous than Sarah did. Apprehensively Freddy tells her, They are having amazing success with the new treatments for depression at the hospital. Hanging at his side in his large fist, Freddy held a white belt with fur lined handcuffs. Dont worry Freddy. Mom is making sure I take my meds on time. I wont be giving you any trouble today. Freddy exhaled a heavy gust of relief and gratitude. He was a large man and frightfully strong, but he was not fast and had poor endurance. Sarah followed him through the overhanging willows and before they closed behind her she took a last look at her friends there. Her own grief suspended, Daphne was hugging a sobbing Lilly. Ben had poked his tiny head through his hole in time for Sarah to return a shining wink of the eye and, never again did Sarah return to that sacred place with a childs mind."
Cold Shiver,"TW: murderCold ShiverBy Heather Ann MartinezBeckys Diner was the only place to grab food for more than twenty miles along Route 55. Linus Stillman had been frequenting Beckys for the majority of the past twenty-five years. It was where he met his wife. It was where he met his birth brother and birth father. It was where he went to when he lost his sales job, when he picked up another and where he felt most at home spring through autumn. Every November, he disappeared from his daily routines. He would emerge the last week of March as if nothing happened. For several weeks out of every year, he wouldnt respond to a text, to a letter, to anyone or anything. At the end of March, he would sit at the counter of Beckys Diner. He didnt engage in small talk with anyone except for Becky. She was, in a way, protective of Linus. She knew his wife died and he had some scattered conversations with his birth family. He knew he still had a lot of unanswered questions as did the police.His wifes body had been found at the bottom of a nearby lake as the ice was melting the first week of March two years earlier. There were bruises on her body. The medical examiner said that both time and water had faded most of the evidence of what happened to her. What was odd to them was what she was wearing. She wore a corduroys jumper and a short-sleeved shirt. The medical examiner thought it was strange because it had snowed a lot that week and she wasnt wearing a coat or shoes.The police followed Linus as much as they could. They suspected he had something to do with his wife Brinlees death. Whenever they questioned him, his answers were short. He wasnt friendly. He never smiled. He never laughed at any of their jokes or even seemed interested in finding out what happened to her. Brinlee did not drive. She was a fearful person. She would rattle off statistics about vehicle accidents and said that she did not want to be responsible for harming another human being. It had bothered the police greatly. They didnt know who harmed her. They didnt know where Linus went for several weeks out of the year. They couldnt find any activity on his credit cards or phone records. His landlord said he always paid rent four months ahead of time. It was as if he vanished before the first snow and returned when the last snowflake melted. No one in town could say for certain they saw him in winter. He was never at a convenient store or at a drive-through. Becky would calm any rumor down by reminding everyone that he had suffered a great loss. She knew his life was not easy. She was there for all of his ups and downs. She tried not to give him any advice. He only wanted her to listen.For Det. Monroe, Linus gave him a cold shiver. Every encounter seemed more pointless than the previous one. Dt. Monroe was convinced Linus had killed his wife. He didnt have any evidence to support his theory. No one could confirm that Linus was even in the area in early March two years ago. There was evidence Brinlee had been in town. A neighbor saw looking for some gardening books the day before she was fished out of the lake. The neighbor said that she seemed cautious as usual, but there was nothing out of the ordinary about her appearance. The neighbor said that Brinlee had a hat, gloves, a heavy coat and was wearing boots. The neighbor remembered that she complained to the librarian about how cold the library was. The librarian told her she would raise the temperature. Brinlee smiled and stayed for a half hour longer.The neighbor said he remembered the incident because Brinlee was talking very loudly and several other library patrons asked her to whisper. Brinlee obliged them but did not make any apologies for speaking loudly to begin with. One of the other library witnesses said that Brinlee seemed lost in a library. She wasnt aware of any of the rules. She didnt know how to look for a book. She knew that she could get books for free but was upset when she was told she would have to return them in six weeks.Det. Monroe contacted Linus birth family but they claimed they didnt know anything. They had only had a few short exchanges with Linus. They admitted they did most of the talking. Linus leaned back in a chair at Beckys diner and listened. Linus didnt tell them much about his foster family or the way he had been raised. He did tell them he would be hard to find between the end of November and the end of March. They did not disclose anything else with Det. Monroe. Det. Monroe thought they were also hiding something but couldnt put his finger on it. He couldnt place them with Brinlee at the time of her death and knew he couldnt badger them for more information. It was Linus he wanted. He would try to provoke some sort of response from him whenever he could, but Linus was also as cool as a cucumber.Linus sat at the counter at Beckys when Det. Monroe spotted him. He got up from one of the tables and sat on the stool next to Linus. He told Linus he was very close to catching Brinlees killer. He said it was just a matter of time and all of the cards would be laid face up on the table. He told Linus he could confess and it would make him feel so much better. Linus did not even flinch. He didnt even look in Det. Monroes direction. Linus was wearing dark sunglasses and a long sleeve shirt. Det. Monroe noticed he had a lot of scars all over his hands. It was as if his hands had been in the mouth of a shark. Det. Monroe asked him where he got the scars. Linus told him there was always a larger predator. As Det. Monroe started grabbing at Linuss collar, Becky told him to let go and not make another scene in her diner. Linus thanked her and started to walk out. Det. Monroe followed him to Linuss home on the other side of town. Linus lived on a working farm. His apartment was on the second level of the barn, but that wasnt where Linus was heading. He was walking into a large shed behind the chicken coop. Det. Monroe heard a lot of other voices coming from the shed including Linuss landlord. Linus was telling the others that the winter had passed and they could soon return to their homes. Their time of slumber was coming to an end.To get a closer look, Det. Monroe used a flashlight and found a small hole in the wall of the shed. He was shocked at what he saw. There were well over fifty people piled one on top of the other. They were all sleeping or trying to sleep. Linus took his spot on the pile. Det. Monroe ran back to Beckys diner and took Becky to the kitchen. He asked her cook to given them the room for a few minutes.Whats going on Floyd? You are going to scare away my customer.Why didnt you tell me Becky? Come on, you should have told me!About Linus? About the others? No, I couldnt get involved.You could have told me he was one of them. You should have told me the minute we found his wifes body. I would have focused my attention elsewhere. You should have told me he was one of the sleepers.Hush! Keep your voice down. You want to scare up all kinds of trouble again. Do you remember the last time someone opened that can of worms?The sleepers were left alone for generations until other people started doing exactly what you have been doing. Asking questions about where he is for the winter months. He is hibernating. They are all hibernating together. Unlike the others, Linus wasnt born like them. He adapted to their way of life. He trained his body to sleep for weeks at a time. The others adapted to colder, harsher temperatures by sleeping through the winter when they were further north. They moved down here when the developers bulldozed their forest and turned it into a ski lodge.What about Brinlee? What happened to her?Linus told me she woke up three weeks early. She didnt know why. She went to the library but hadnt been there before. She went out to the lake and a bear attacked her and Linus followed her and tried to defend her. But it was too late. The bear killed Brinlee and Linus heard someone coming. He rolled her body in the lake. Her coat and shoes were buried during the attack. That was when she was found.At least, now I know what is going on. It all makes sense now, but how am I going to tell my boss?You cant tell anyone! That was how people found out about them years ago. Dont you remember? Those scientists came up here and wanted to know how they figured out how to adapt to colder climates, how the could become one with a cold shiver.They reduce their heart rate, their breathing, everything and sleep for weeks at a time. Tell your boss it is a cold case and leave it be. Those people have been through enough. Linus has been a mess. I am afraid he is going to tell someone about the sleepers. His birth father was asking a lot of questions the last time he visited.A cold case, huh? You arent hiding any leprechauns or Big Foot up here, are ya?No, those are fairy tales.Just checkin. Well thanks for letting me know. Im now going back to the station to tell my boss the case went cold and Linus Stillman is no longer a person of interest.Thanks, Floyd. Now lets get back to business."
The Old Hag and the Pig,"There once was an old hag who lived alone in a shack in the woods. She has not always been an old hag, but had been born the daughter of a rich man and a beautiful woman, both of whom had hoped that she would grow up to marry the Prince. Instead, while she was still young her mother died, her father remarried just before dying himself, and the Prince married her stepsister. Shortly thereafter, bitter and angry because of her own tragedies and the good fortune of her stepsister, she moved out into the woods.	One day while out picking herbs the old hag sang aloud, as she was want to do, for she had a sweet voice. As she ventured deeper into the forest, she crossed paths with a feral pig foraging in unfamiliar woods. So delighted was the pig that he forgot what he was doing and followed the old woman in order to listen to her sad, old songs which reminded him of his own sad, old memories.	When the old hag bent over to pluck some herb, she closed her lips and hummed, causing the pig to worry.	""Please don't stop singing,"" said the pig. The old hag turned with a start and was shocked to see that it was a pig who had spoken. It has been a long time since I have heard a human voice and a very long time since I have heard one who could sing so beautifully. Please dont stop.	""Well,"" said the hag as she cleared her throat. ""I suppose I could continue singing, though I am growing weary and desire to return home. Only, while I have been out collecting herbs I have not found any thyme. Help me find some and I will sing to you all the while.	So the pig led her to some thyme, only he decided to take a long route in getting there, since he desired to keep the old hag singing as long as possible.	""Now that I have my herbs,"" said the hag, I will be wanting to get home. Only, it is getting so late and dark that I am afraid to travel alone. Walk me safely home and I will sing to you all the while.	So the pig and the old hag walked back to her home through the dark woods. But in the middle of their walk an owl began to swoop down near their heads, hooting and flapping its wings furiously. The pig snorted in dismay, upset that the owl had interrupted the old womans singing. The old woman hissed and threw a stick at the owl. But as the owl flew away, it looked back the pig. Then the old hag started back her singing.	When they arrived at the old hags house, she went inside and lit a candle, leaving her front door open for the pig.	Now that I am home, said the old hag, I will be wanting to start my stew. Only, it will be a lot of stew, and I desire company. Stay and share some stew with me and I will sing to you all the while.	So the pig stayed with the old hag and rested by her hearth while she sang. She had been singing half the day, however, and had already sung all the sad, old songs she knew best. She scoured her memory for anything else and eventually came up with a jolly tune, which was the first song to make the pig cry.	""What is the matter?"" The old hag asked.	I know this song. I have heard it many times before. But how is it that an old hag like you came to learn it?	I heard it being sung in the court of my stepsister and the Prince when they were married.	The pig jumped to his feet. If your sister is married to the Prince, then you too must be a princess.	The old hag laughed. Perhaps. But only the princess of this shack and these woods.	That does not matter, said the pig, and he walked near to the old hag. Princess, I have helped you find your herbs, I have walked you home, and I have kept you company. All I have asked for so far is that you sing. But now I ask for one more thing. I ask for you to kiss me.""	I have been alone in these words for many year. I have suffered loneliness because of it. But I have not been alone long enough nor suffered loneliness great enough that I will begin kissing pigs. And the old hag laughed again.	But you must kiss me, Princess. Please, tell me what I must do to earn this reward.	The old hag stopped her laughter, bent down, and pet the pig.	The water is boiling, she said, so I will fetch some vegetables. We can talk of rewards and kisses when I get back.	The old hag then went down into the cellar. When she had gone, the pig busied himself by fetching her two bowls from the cabinet.	Do you know what you're doing? a voice called to the pig.	The pig looked up and saw in the window the same owl from the woods.	I beg your pardon? said the pig.	The owl said, Do you know what you are doing here in this house with this old hag?	The woman here is a princess, and I have been keeping her company and listening to her sing.	You must have wandered into these woods today, because all of us from here are familiar with her singing.	I am not from here, and I have not grown tired of her singing yet.	When this old hag first moved into these woods, she would sing beautifully every day, luring us near to listen and keep her company. Often we would help her with her chores to keep house and share her supper. But after several years passed, we began to notice that some of us would disappear after supper. So fewer of us went in to help her with her chores. And as more years passed, fewer and fewer would return from visits with her. We all know now to stay far from the old hag in the shack. Even now, do you know why she is heating up thatpot of water? Where is the meat for it?	But she is a princess, the pig said a moment before the old hag leapt out with an axe and chopped off the pigs head so that it landed into the bowl at his feet. She then laughed and hissed and spit at the owl until it flew away.	The old hag began to butcher the pig and dropped several chunks of pork into her stew along with the thyme he had helped her find. She sang all the while, happy at her luck for having come across such a fat, stupid pig. Then after it had stewed for a few minutes, she took a spoonful of the stew to taste. In her spoon, there was a big chunk of meat. She blew on it to cool it, and when she touched it to her lips, the meat fizzled and popped. She drew it back from her face and noticed that the meat looked ever-so-slightly different. She smelled it, and the smell was somewhat changed. She took a small bite, and noticed that the meat tasted unlike any pork she had eaten before. When she looked back where the dead pig had lain, she saw instead the naked, butchered corpse of a man. Inside the bowl before it was his head."
What a Pretty Fae,"Part I 	The woods were ancient. The tall trees dominated the land, giving refuge to the many critters and creatures above and below. Pillars of bright light pierced through the vibrant green canopy. The lush undergrowth gave shelter to the many animals stirring as spring began her slow thaw of the land. The snow that crept down from the mountains, now retreated up the rocky hillsides once more.	Cy walked leisurely over the gnarled roots which claimed most of the obscured path winding through the majestic trees. Cys red robe could be seen passing between the massive trunks as she walked. Along the trunks bright red toadstools sprouted out of the shelf fungi to give homes to the smaller fairies roaming these parts. Cys eyes passed over the red, spotted mushrooms seeking out any pixies awakening from their winter slumber. As her gaze travelled along the trunks, she spotted a great stag further in the distance. His slow graze through the fresh greens had her pausing to admire his nobility of the forest before she quietly continued her hike towards the nearby town.	Cy reached the top of a small rise in the path and stopped to admire the vast mountains along the horizon. Their mighty expanse protected this land from the harsher beasts and weather on the other side. As she gazed out, Cy heard a familiar faint whirring and quickly turned, searching for the source. The sound brought her back to her childhood of searching for the will-o-wisps, but they evaded her sight this time. She tucked a loose strand of brown hair behind her pointed ear while scouring the area, knowing it was still too bright to see them.	Wow, what pretty ears you have! A tiny voice said below. But whats a fae doing out here, Mama? Cy looked down and saw three hares munching on a patch of green grass while bathing in a small pool of sunlight. The larger one looked up to Cy as she answered, I am not sure why any creature would travel these woods . Cy swore she saw the mother hare glare at her. Which is why we? The mother trailed off and her two offspring chimed together. Travel in groups! Cys lips curved slightly as she went on her way.  she thought to herself,  Part II 	Cy bent down to the freshly melted water of the lake and splashed the frigid water on her face then refilled her canteen. After snacking on an apple and some cheese from her pack, she sat down next to the shore for a rest. She gazed out at the beauty before her. The reflections in the water made the forest and mountains seem surreal. Her gaze drifted over the nearby shore but stopped when she saw the giant wolf. The beasts white and brown fur shone in the spring sun as she lapped up some fresh water. Cy stood quickly and called out. Blaidd! The wolf spirit of the forest looked up slowly as Cy waved to her. The giant wolf merely tipped her head in acknowledgement then slowly turned and left the lakeside.	Cy packed up her few belongings and began her short trek back to the trail. The trees in this area were more dispersed and reached higher, letting more sunlight through to the base which allowed the smaller, vibrant bushes to grow. A flurry of motion went off to her right, followed by another to her left. Someone was herding her.	I know youre out there! Cy shouted as she reached for her two small blades strapped to her low back under her pack.	Those wont do you much good against us, princess. Cy looked to her right and saw a dark coloured wolf staring down at her. More wolves of mixed colouring slowly revealed themselves. She was surrounded.	Took long enough at the lake. We were getting worried you wouldnt show in time for lunch. The wolves chortled, the only laugh a wolf could do.	Leave me in peace and I wont hurt you, Cy doubted she could fight them all off, but she had to prove her village wrong. The wolves all chortled again at her false bravery.	With that cloak, youre lucky we were the ones to find you. There are far worse predators in these woods. He snarled and began stalking towards her.	Spoken like a true fox, Cy shot back. The wolves all growled in unison.	Foolish, weak fae girl. Out alone wearing that, the wolf snarled. You are ringing the lunch bell for any creature in your vicinity.	His words resonated with her, like a Cy took her hands off her blades and cupped them around her mouth as she filled her lungs with air. Blaidd! Cy screamed as loud as she could, repeated the yell three more times before facing the head wolf. Im not so sure your boss will appreciate your attitude towards the new clan leader. Cy gave him a smirk as the other wolves began scampering off, ears and tails lowered.	The wolf stood his ground a few more seconds before his ear twitched, hearing the crashing in the distance. This isnt over, girl, he growled. A female leader will not last. He turned and ran. His departure was right on time as Blaidd came crashing through the nearby brush and growled at Cy and the empty area.	Cyfrwys! Blaidd growled. You cannot use me to get out of trouble.	It was your wolves causing trouble! They know the laws. Cy began her hike up to the path.	As do you, young one. You must be on the path. Use your head, girl. Blaidd took a deep breath and walked beside Cy who put out her hand and rested it on the giants shoulder. The soft fur brought back memories of a much smaller Cy falling asleep on Blaidds back on her familys trips between the towns.	How has the spring been this year? Cy attempted at small talk. Blaidds side expanded under Cys hand as she gave a big sigh through her nose.	Spring has its usual beauties, they both paused to watch an intricate blue butterfly float pass them. But there are shortcomings. We are losing more land to the nearby farmers and more deer to the hunters. This will be another tough season. She eyed sidelong at Cy. What brings you out to the forest so late. And alone?	Im visiting Mhamo, I have her medicine that mom makes. Mom didnt feel up to the trip with everything. She gripped the fur under her hand as pain laced through her chest.	I am sorry for your loss little one, Blaidd said quietly. He was a great warrior and leader. Blaidd let the silence carry on, both walking in comfort until reaching the path. You must be smarter from now on. It is late for this long of a journey, especially on your own. I wont be able to save you from everything. Keep your wits about you, and keep those blades handy. Cy smiled as Blaidd gave a wolfish wink before trotting off into the bushes. Cy took a deep, steadying breath and continued on, careful to stay on the path. Part III 	With the sun sinking below the horizon, shadows lengthened, attempting to blanket the world. The symphony of birds and insects had died out, the forest encased in an eerie silence. Cys heart sank as she gazed at the path ahead. What was once an easy trail had become a dark, marshy hollow with close-set trees blocking out any remaining light. The ground was covered with white mold from the melting of the snow and moisture in the spring. The white netting resembled spiders silk too much for Cys taste, but she had come so far, so she pressed on. She felt for her two blades at her lower back and kept a steady pace, eyes and ears alert.	The path dipped down lower into a small gorge, rock walls rising up to her shoulders, then slightly over her head as she continued a slow descent. The walls on either side were slick with mud, the temperature dropping significantly. She could almost feel the cold radiating off the land around her, as if attempting to suck any heat from the living.	Cy froze, eyes scanning the dark terrain, her pointed ears listening for whatever was pricking her senses as chills crept up her spine. She couldnt hear or see anything but goosebumps rose along her arms as the stench of rot grew. Her heart rate began to rise and panic began to tighten a vice around her lungs. She felt him then. A cold presence drifted around her side, ice permeating through her clothes. Cys bowels turned liquid as her gaze met the dead spirits glowing eyes.	His essence was like a cloud, not fully there when she focused on him, but solidified when she looked away. His face was male, though his flesh was rough, like rotten tree bark. A wispy, dark cloak covered what was left of him as he floated in front of her. There was nothing friendly in the wraiths sharp eyes.	What is a pretty thing like you roaming around my home? The wraith rasped as he circled around Cy. She knew the old false tales that wraiths only gain power over you if you gave them notice. But she also knew the truth behind the warning- do not give them any power over you.	I am minding my own business. As you should be. Cy stood tall and tried not to let her shoulders shake as the temperature continued to drop. Her hands itched for her blades, but she knew they were useless. She was useless against him. Her heart beat faster and harder in her chest, fear building. She should not have come.	What pretty eyes you have. His face came over her right shoulder as his tattered cloak draped and flowed in the non-existent breeze. So pretty... to be alone. His voice was a deep, soothing sound. Alone. In the forest. He floated closer, his mouth near her neck, blowing freezing, dead air onto her as he spoke.  forest. His voice changed from a smooth melody to an angry rasp then back again.	Wearing such a beacon as this. He reached for her red cape, she stopped breathing when the material moved under his thin, skeleton of a hand.  Such an... inviting colour. Not one I get to see often. His cold voice was calm, patient as his bright eyes met hers. Cy tried not to move, not to show signs of her fear as his cold essence soaked into her soul.	Cy broke the stare by closing her eyes and taking a deep breath, ignoring the growing stench of rot, and tried to clear her thoughts. Screaming wouldnt help, neither would fighting. This wraith must have died this past winter, taking over this part of the forest as his haunt. He probably died from the elements...	You must be cold, Cy said as calmly as she could, opening her eyes but staring straight ahead as he floated around the small area. You must be in need of a new cloak. She spoke with no emotion. The wraith stopped his circling and drifted in front of her, waiting. I have a spare. Cy slowly took off her pack without moving her gaze. She extended the bag to the dead fae in front of her, who was fading slightly. There is a cloak in here, she lied.	The wraith paused, as if waiting for a trap to spring, then shot forward for the gift. But Cy was faster. She threw the pack into the woods away from the path. The wraith gave out a shrill shriek that resonated through the ground and woods as it flew after the cloak. Cy sprinted out of the lair, refusing the urge to look back. She kept her eyes on the wet ground, jumping over rocks and logs until she was back out into the warmer wooded path where she turned and emptied her stomach into the nearby bush. Part IV 	Disappointment had slowly replaced her fear as she neared the town without her Mhamos medicine. The entire trips purpose was lost to foul luck and unacceptable naivety. She chided herself knowing that her mother and clan would be disappointed at her failure.	She left the forest trail and walked along a pebble path that ran alongside the towns wall. She turned north, heading towards the gated entrance. The sun had completely set, giving the torches along the wall the only source of light. As Cy approached the last turn before the gate she saw a small group of inebriated males who were drinking and smoking on the path. Cy tried to ignore their gazes as she walked by, holding her head up high and not giving them the satisfaction of unnerving her.	She passed in front of the small group, eyes ahead, until a sharp smack hit her backside. What a nice ass you have there, darlin? Cy froze in shock. Too bad its covered by that red atrocity. Cy turned in anger. Whoa ho! The drunk males gaze went to her chest. And the fronts not too bad either! Icy rage coursed through her veins as all four males took in her figure and hooted. She shook with rage and couldnt muster a response. Dressed like that, youre asking for a spankin! You should be grateful me and my friends are here to protect you. There are some creeps in this town. Some women oft get hurt bein by themselves. All four men nodded with leering smiles on their faces.	Touch me and Ill report you to the town guard, Cy said as sternly as she could.	Baha! Whats them idiots gonna believe? A strange female or four males who appen to be on good terms with the council? The males stalked around her.	You mean the council of older fae males? The main guy nodded, a sinister grin plastered to his face. You mean the council of fae males who my father had frequently- before she could finish, one of the males darted forward and restrained her arms behind her back.	Yer daddy aint here to save you, though. Is he? The man reeked of alcohol as he spoke mere inches from her face. Cy felt fear creep yet again into her heart. They were right, no one would believe her over them. She was alone. Cy thought about her father then, about everything he taught her. His blades strapped to her back.	The male holding her pressed himself firmly against her back, pressed his mouth into her neck and inhaled deeply. Cy smirked and took her opportunity. She threw herself backwards forcing the male to stumble back giving her the space to slam the heel of her boot on to his foot. He yelled out in pain and released her while she screamed hoping the guards at the gate would hear. Before the males could grab her again, she reached behind her and finally unsheathed the legendary blades bestowed upon her by her warrior father. Who had taught her well.	I am female, but I am not weak, Cyfrwys said as she lunged.  Welsh translations:Cyfrwys = CunningMhamo = GrandmotherBlaidd = Wolf"
The Savior,"""Tell us a story, baba,"" the children asked, hungry for another tale woven to lull them to sleep""The one with the rose and the beast.""""No, it is too girly, tell us a story about the pirates.""Their grandpa smiled benevolently over them, his smile reached his eyes, lighting his dim grey eyes, he said,""Fine, I'll tell you a story, but it is a real one, of the times when we could talk to the plants and animals, the gods and the spirits.""""Pfft! it is impossible."" said the elder ones, turning their noses up and looking scornfully at young ones, who still believed that Santa Claus came down their chimney covered in soot, to give them presents.""Ah, but it is true, you see, you can still hear them whispering when it is the hour of peace and calm, at night when the horns aren't honking and only the bird's chirp can be heard, lulling their little ones to sleep or the nocturnal ones, hunting for prey.""""If you listen closely, you will hear them speak, of the times when they were young, recounting the adventures they had experienced.""""What sort of adventures, babu?"" they asked, hanging on his every word.""Like, when the Winter Lord tried to take over the world,"" he said in a hushed tone.The Winter Lord?""""Yes, him, who rules at the time of Winter.""""The story, Jeremy, is for you to finish""""His mother died soon after, just like she had prophesized and in the meanwhile, war was going on. He did not know, and wandered the streets, open to friend and foe alike.""""A battle had been going on, unbeknownst to him.""""Both sides were eager to win and kept fighting desperately. They retired as soon as the sun sank. But, the forces of evil were at work that night, the forces of The Lord of Winter. He sent some men from his army and they stabbed all the warriors to their death in their sleep. It was a dishonourable act, yes, thus he was cursed. He was cursed with the ability to read minds, as soon as he came before The Savior and it was his doom.""""How so? Isn't reading minds a superpower?""""It can be, and it cannot be, depends whether you can harness it and he couldn't and he went mad.Jeremy by now knew everything about the battle, learning facts from the vegetable sellers, who were always ready for gossip, yet he was clueless about who was The Savior.There had been a call for the world's young and brave men, and he set out to war, in hopes of fighting for Lord Summer and Spring and when he faced the enemy at the battlefront, the curse of Lord Winter started working. He knew everything, he knew the Lord of Summer and Spring's plans and defeated them easily and they had to retreat for the day. The Lords sat around a table and discussed their plans, and they fought, they were disunited in action, united in a goal. They loathed their lieges and betrayed them to the other side, so the Lords gathered, and decided to put an end to it. They came up with a plan. A plan is the base of war and strategy, without it, you are lost.They knew The Savior had come, but they knew not who it was. But they had come up with a plan now, and Jeremy volunteered to execute it. Thus, the prophecy started working.Jeremy slipped inside Lord Winter's tent and told him he could help him defeat his enemies. In the evening, when everyone was resting, Jeremy took him to a small room, in the enemies camp, where he proclaimed their weapons were kept.But in the room, he found nothing, yet he sensed several presences, each planning his doom, he heard them whispering, a thousand voices, ununited in nature, united to kill him. He was desperate to live, as he tried to source them, to destroy them and under this pressure, his hand withered away. His feet withered away. Yet he noticed not, for his senses stopped working, his brain froze, and his heart stopped. Yet, he lunged for the door, to kill all the lords who triumphed over their victory.

Fairy Tale Meets Fabio,"Fairy Tale Meets Fabio  	Long, long ago, and far, far, away from anywhere your mama might have told you about, a lone man walked the floor of the pine, needled earth. It was a time so far back, you could smell the green, the dark richness of the soil and the worms within. 	His senses were keen like the animals that surrounded him, often raising his head to the clean blue of the sky to smell what was about. Sometimes, those skies would darken by the shadows of countless birds, while the land creatures loped by his side. It was a time of plenitude of creatures, and only taking what was needed from the land. The man did not even know the word for waste. Souls were refreshed and awakened by this peace and graciousness. 	The man could hold a rabbit or help an injured boar. Once, a mother bear put out a frantic plea to the man to help find her lost cub. After two long days and many miles, he found the cub, safe in an old abandoned bear den. Of all the animals, though, the wolves held the most reverence, they were of the same spirit and shared a love for running and straining their taut muscles through the woods. The forest floor often was a blur as paws ran with feet and flew over rocks, brush and packed dirt, only stopping to gulp enough air to satisfy their lungs. 	The man knew the mind of the wolf and most of the other animals, no words were needed, yet they communicated much. There was respect and kindness with a gentle quietness. This language, talking to the spirits and living in harmony with nature, were tools handed down through his tribe and transcended all life. 	He was separated from his tribe since he was a wiry twelve year old. Now, sinewy muscles, bronze skin and long hair helped accentuate his handsome features, but the squirrels and chipmunks took no notice, nor did the man. This romance book cover looking of a guy, however, didnt mind his looks wasted in the woodlands, he had his animals if not his tribe, and cared about deeper impressions. 	Aside from changes in the weather, deciduous trees, and occasional shifts in the animal habitats, things were predictable in the mans world, and he found contentment in all its beauty. Although he longed for some human contact, he never strayed from his delight with the animals. 	Yes, you guessed it, as fate would have it, one day while foraging for mushrooms, he heard a strange noise. He froze as did the wolf by his side. They listened, smelled the air and waited. The sound came again, so foreign to his ears, it took him a while until he realized it was a scream! Usually, he assessed, planned and executed into action anything in the wild that needed tending but this was a new challenge.   	2 	Finally, his feet led the way as his mind caught up. He followed the scream to the riverbank and saw a shape struggling in the water. The river looked greedy, not wanting to share the figure but swallow it up whole. He sliced through the rushing water, however, and grabbed her around the neck and swam as his strong muscles fought off the rivers pull. Once on the bank, he placed her on the dirt and marveled at the sight of another person in front of him, and a woman at that. 	While he was busy marvelling, she coughed violently, then vomitted, not the way he hoped for a first encounter. She continued this until there could be no question of anything left inside her. Then she shuddered as she looked up at him, not sure if the cause was from the man or river. He stared with deep hazel eyes that gave no indication of what he was thinking. She swallowed and tried to speak but coughed again and thankfully, nothing more followed. 	She looked at the wilderness around her, then back at the man and smiled, for she felt calm instead of fear. When you are a woman, and of these times, running away from abuse, curses and some evil thrown in, any alternative can be salvation. Again, those hazel eyes stared, then a hand took her arm, gently -relief. He helped her up onto her unsteady feet and checked her body as she blushed, how could she know it was an injury check. She waited for him to speak, but when her curiosity was met with silence, she spoke up. She touched her chest and said,MarianaHe said nothing, so she repeated the gesture and her name. He reached out, and to her embarrassment, touched her chest and said something somewhat similar to her name.No, Im Mariana. Now you, whats your name? And she put a tentative hand on his broad chest.He looked at her and said something she did not recognize. He saw the look of confusion, so said it once more and slowly.Calian.Then he spoke words in a language that was unfamiliar and captivating with its songlike flow. Consonants and vowels never held such a trance-like power before, making her long for comprehension.Im sorry, I dont understand, but I do have the time to learn, and this looks like it could take quite a while. 	The man walked her back to his thatched home as the animals peered from within the safety of the forest, not understanding the presence of this other female animal. She instantly felt peace and only looked over her shoulder a few times. There was a simple beauty to his place. She scanned the tools, the warmth of the design and the feel of contentment that seemed to flow from the earth and into his home. The outside garden area seemed to let all of nature seep into his dwelling, giving it a natural and open feel, which was exactly what Mariana 3 longed for. She noticed no other people around, she thanked the gods, only animals and they appeared to have a special bond with him. 	Mariana had inherited her own strengths that were often the cause of envy and attacks. She had survived abuse at the hands of a man, a curse from a cruel overseer and vicious encounters from neighbors. What made her laugh, was the idea that the curse and abuse were connected and ultimately, only helped her gain release from its control. She was cursed to silence in her village, so when she was able, she ran away where the curse did not hold its power and the abuse ceased. Without her voice, she could not wield the power over the wind and of nature, once away from the town whence she was cursed, she was free. 	The weeks of learning the land as well as each other turned into months. Mariana and Calian often spoke in a mix of the two languages, and had endless days sharing knowledge and finding treasures in the river and woodland. Although she knew she could trust Calian, she kept her powers a secret, she knew all too well the pain that others could wield once they found out. Mariana was in no haste to disclose her ability and the months pleasantly flowed without a need for its use. Her intentions were not to keep her natural born gift hidden, but time seemed to have its own power over her. 	They walked along the well worn path to the river and found a dusty rose feather of the grosbeak bird, a brilliant yellow from a flycatcher and two eye catching orange ones from a crossbill. She tickled him with a crossbill feather and they both laughed. Suddenly, he froze and pushed her behind him, as three men emerged from the woods. One burly and very dirty looking man sneered at them both as he pushed his way to her.	Well, well, so you thought you could escape me. He literally spat out the words followed with some wretched looking phlegm globbed out at his feet, probably for effect.	You are coming with me and this man next to you is dead if he tries to stop me.Knives were drawn from the other two men as the man moved in. He was wasting no time in collecting what he clearly thought he owned.	No. Calian yelled and held her behind him He might have missed some of the mans evil words but understood all too clearly his intent.	Fine. But just to warn you, well leave your body out for the animals when were done, no burial from us. Another glob on the ground, this time closer to Calian.	They moved in and slashed at air as Calian deflected the strikes, knocking one man down with a heavy blow to his head. The other kept circling like a wolf, mistake- as Calian expertly dodged then struck him repeatedly, until he also was in a heap next to the first attacker. When Calian finished with the man, the burly ""spitter"" struck a cowardly blow to Calian as Mariana screamed. He hit him again while he was down, then rolled him over to a drop off by the river. He was trying to throw him over the cliff when Mariana spread her arms out. She summoned the wind with a quick plea. At first, there was only a slight stir in the air but she kept pursuing. Gratefully, man had some difficulty moving the muscular Calian, but was nearing the precipice, when the wind increased to a roar. It swirled first low to the ground then spiraling4 upward, rising like a reverse tornado. The man stopped and stared, his last mistake of this world. The wind gripped under his feet and flipped him clear off the cliff only stopping to hit each rock cragg, on the way down. The wind offered no mercy today.  Once the other two men roused and saw what happened to their leader, they scrambled upright and fled, tripping often with a little help from the wind. 	Calian got up from his head injury in time to observe Mariana commanding the earths element. He was amazed at the woman he cared for and admired her even more for thestrength she possessed and ruled with such ease. He knew the spirits of the earth would never grant someone such power unless they had faith in her.  Instead of shunning her, as she feared, he ran over and held her tightly. Mariana knew she had found true magic and a place within this world where she finally could be both strong and loved. 	They walked back to the hut hand in hand down the path away from the river and all thoughts of the men and their invasion. Suddenly, a fairy flew around the pair several times, then led the way back to the hut. Mariana stopped short and stared after her as Calian simply smiled.	Yes, its what youre thinking it is, what else would you expect in this land!?	At that moment the birds fluttered away and a sunbeam of light hit Calians teeth at the perfect angle and sent a dazzling shine into Marianas sight. She thought she even heard the tinkling of a bell to match his sparkle. Paradise and perfection in the woods, she thought. And of course, the charming couple lived happily ever after.

Princess Alena: A wandering locket,"It was very long ago when the king and queen are walking in the sanctuary for feeding animals, they were sentenced by an eternal saint, the princess will be born dead and evil spirits visit to feast on her.( with an intense tone)And days passed along but the king was haunted by the prophecy which he heard from the eternal saint as well as king became weak watching the queen bedridden (from the moment she heard the saint). Soon, after the sightings king noticed that the queens illness, nightmares, and animals vanishing from the sanctuary are related, king ordered the soldiers to safeguard the palace and to find the missing animals.Soon after the search throughout the kingdom soldiers were unable to find the animals that were lost, listening to this king fell apart. And wasnt ready to lose anymore, noticing the misery of the ruler, the sun went down.Now, in another kingdom called fairyland, there was a little princess with a lovely locket around her neck and she was so beautiful, cute, and sweet. As she was playing around in the palace. She was surprised staring at her fellow friends and rushed towards king-Queen (father and mother) with her tiny feet, bluish-pink fork, and newly out wings. Then reaching to the lap of mother, father aside little princess asked, why people dont have lockets like me? And why dont I have a long stick as others? (With curiosity tone). Then, the king and queen smiled at her, answered the little princess, she is very special so she got a locket, and also she doesnt need any long stick to use her magic power. Suddenly little princess said to the king and queen that some animal is in danger far in the forest. Then the king asked his daughter to know that, is she willing to save the animal or not? The surprisingly little princess nodded her head as yes. Seeing her fully functioning tiny wings king exclaimed you can go my sunshine. While the queen felt a bit terrible seeing her daughter flying into the dense forest. After reaching the forest little princess heard the screams so clearly which seems that she was so close to the animal. And she was so right, the animal is rushing towards her from behind and as soon as she saw the thing (animal), the princess yelled stop. Then both were surprised to see each other that they were able to hear and understand. Princess was surprised as the animal followed her request and the animal was surprised as it could listen from another living thing. With a trembling voice animal exclaimed, why did you stop me? I was just trying to save my life from the hunter. Within their talk the hunter arrived at that place, so the princess made the animal invisible by holding her locket (performing magic), then the hunter asked the princess about the animal and she said no, as the hunter passed out of the forest. Princess felt unconscious and the magical spark broke out with which animal was back to visible. Seeing the condition of the little angel animal took her to his den and settled the angel onto the fluffy honeycomb. Then cubs of the animal entered the den, seeing the bed taken cubs shouted who is this lying in our bed? As the wind was strong, cool breezes entered the den flying the cape covered on the princess. Looking at the little girl rubbing her eyes and trying to get the cape cubs cried out for disturbing the little girl and helped her to get under the cape.When it was morning little princess awoke and was searching for food. And was about to cry as she was unable to find the food, seeing the little girl cubs gave her some cherries and honey to eat. Soon enough princess heard the approach of a thing she uttered, All of you go and hide now. Within no time cubs settled behind the small tree in the den. As the thing was approaching closely princess was about to attack, but as the animal shouted, it is me little angel one you saved from the hunter, the princess sat down right in the same place she was about to attack. And asked the animal, what is your name? And why are you hiding here? And where is your home? Continuing the talking animal said we are called bears. This isnt our home, we left our home to be alive and for the food. So, we travel from place to place for food and hide in the den which we find for that particular day. After that little princess prepared to return back home, but she heard a soft voice in her mind stating my sunshine dont you want to see the other beautiful creatures out in the woods, I wish you will enjoy noticing them. Hearing this princess became so curious and decided to stay back to meet the creatures. Then she started running in the forest as fast as she can to see the other animals. However, her feet started troubling her after a distance. Then bear carried angel on his back as he was following her from back then (from the den). As they were passing by long to small trees princess started asking what is this? What is that? Oh! I really want to know what this is. And bear became busy in explaining her things from weeds to fruits then even trees and the talk continued as,And as princess seemed to fallen in thoughts, bear asked what it is. Or have you heard about () before the long bear was about to finish his sentence, princess exclaimed we have to save it soon, bear asked what! What we have to save and where is it. Princess with a low tone utter, there that thing up between the trees, which is stuck in the lines of thread? Noticing it bear stood on his feet, so that the little angel was able to reach the threads, and then by using her locket princess landed the ant on the ground. Then the princess warned it never to climb heights when you are alone and all started roaming in the forest. After, sometime they noticed something strange that the little princess body was vanishing, and the princess has no clue, where she heard the voice again stating dont think about it sunshine just stay calm and enjoy everything, cause you can understand everything in your journey. After that, as the princess slept back on the bear, he and his cubs along with ant found a den and all together went to rest for that night.The next morning, altogether left the den and started traveling, and then ant was like,Stop said the little princess, I sense the injured animal. Bear lets move towards that animal it is just 100 feet ahead of us. After which they witnessed the badly injured deer with blood flowing all over her body. As the princess hold the locket to perform magic, she flew into the air and light was emitting from her turning her just near to invisible by curing the injured deer. Then deer exclaimed that she ran from the circus facility because the town was turning into hell by evil spirits and I was wounded by one of the evil. Making these statements deer also expressed its fear as,Meanwhile, the little princess turned invisible and floating in the air only with the visible locket. So, the little angel asked the bear can we go to the town. Bear gave an expression as disapproved but as angel started asking continuously whole crew bear and its cubs, ant, deer, foxes (hiding behind them), enter the town which turned hell. They noticed that not a single living organism is there in the streets and houses. Princess was so desperate to save the town seeing the huge disaster, but everyone in the crew opposed her decision and bought her out of the town. But, as they were leaving their footprint making traces behind them (black smokes in form of their feet). As the princess turned invisible she used this chance and left the crew forward returning to the town and when she used her magic whole town came back alive. And people saw the locket floating in the air. Hearing the sounds, light scattering from the town whole crew members reached the town. But, the little princess left the town already. As she was scared by the looks of people. And the path started healing itself as the princess was traveling. Soon, tracing, following the path animals reached princess. So, soon princess became the talk, between the people and they named her as the wandering locket because they were unable to the princess. However, as the dawn was out they entered the large gate with long trees and had a nap.At night in her consciousness princess started hearing voices as, my beautiful sunshine we are as worried and unhappy as we are going to lose you for years because you have reached the end of your travel, and tomorrow who will do the right thing?Chipmunks singingAs the voices were, too loud princess and crew woke up, bears, ant, deer, foxes, owl (far in the forest) rushed towards the song. And chipmunks stopped singing, waking up the remaining animals (butterflies, moose, raccoons, ants, hawks, cardinals, goldfinches) as they saw the return of their family. Where everyone started grabbing each other and princess voice heard softly, what is this place bear? Continuing it bear replied this is home from where I escaped, escaped what are you saying? Yes, little angel and started explaining the story of a king, queen, and saint. After the illness of the queen, the king stopped feeding us and evil spirits attacking this place so I left this place with my sons and daughters like that I saw you in the forest. Then by listening to the whole story princess came to a conclusion that the whole time the locket was trying to bring me to this very moment and father, mother made it happened without explaining it, not even about my powers. And princess heard the voice again, sunshine this will be last time I can speak with you I am here to say this is the day the princess of king and queen is going to take birth and you have to enter into her unlively body to make it alive and remember it sunshine ones you came to know about your powers in the locket who can travel back to our home and also evil spirits will come back once again. As the voices in her brain were fading father, the mother explains to me once again means what? How? I havent seen them. Between all animals started uttering are you wandering locket people are talking about. Then bear replied she is not a wandering locket, she is a princess from fairyland because of my mistake leaving the sanctuary bought her here, and as she started using her powers to help us and this place she turned invisible. Then, little princess, animals experienced the birth of the child in the palace. After which little princess smiled facing animals as a message of leaving. As she was turning in to bright light and slowly entering into the born corpse, the princess remembered the old voices of her parents discussing, queen what name suits our little daughter?And animals asked bear what is the name of this little angel?Breaking through the sky evil spirits turned at the palace stating get out of our site fairy princess (Al) and as the light along with the locket occupied the child every living entity answered ALENA at the end of the light.As soon as the locket reached the child evil spirits started attacking the palace to kill the child for their feast. Sensing the attacks all the animals in the sanctuary gathered around the child, where the aura of the little princess added extra strength to the animals fighting the evil spirits away. And within which little princess started smiling as birds bought her throne made of flowers. After which the kingdom was back to normal, kind-queen were happy and animals playing with the baby princess. Where, the voices sang,"
"SARAH, FIDO AND SPARKLE","SARAH, FIDO AND SPARKLEWhere are you going with that book Sarah?Im going to talk to the fairies at the bottom of the garden Mummy.Dont be so ridiculous child, theres no such thing as fairies and certainly there arent any at the bottom of  garden. Whoever heard of such a thing?But Ive seen them mummy. They are there every day and I talk to them.Yes, Ive heard you talking and I dont like it. If I hear you talking to yourself again, Im going to have to get you to the doctor and see what hes got to say about it. Im just not having it. Youre an intelligent child and intelligent children just dont talk to themselves. Do you hear me?Yes mummy but.But nothing. Im telling you and thats final. You can sit under the tree and read your book but no talking to yourself or anything else, especially fairies. They only exist in books. And if youre not careful Ill take your books away from you, my girl. Ive had just about as much as I can take. Now get down the garden and read quietly to yourself.Yes Mummy.Sarah was almost in tears as she walked down the long winding garden path to her favourite tree.Sarah. Sarah. The soft voice was a accompanied by a tinkling sound, like a wind chime.Go away. Im not allowed to talk to you. You keep getting me into trouble.Im so sorry Sarah, Said Sparkle the fairy as she waved her magic wand and sat on a tree root next to Sarah.Mummy is really cross with me today. She says shes going to take my books away from me. She says shell take me to see the doctor if I dont stop talking to you. I mean, talking to myself. You know I talk to you dont you Sparkle? You know I dont talk to myself at all, ever.Yes, said Sparkle as she waved her magic wand at Sarah and let all the fairy dust land on her their heads.Stop it, that tickles and makes me laugh.Well, that is good and much better than crying, Sarah.Sarah wiped her eyes and sniffed a little.Can I read to you Sparkle?Yes, of course. I love it when you read to me. But you must whisper as quietly as you can so that I am the only one who hears you.Sarah began to read her book about Fido the dog who kept burying his bone.Thats a lovely story Sarah. Thank you for reading it to me today.Id love to have a dog of my own, said Sarah.Would you? Said Sparkle.Yes. I would call it Fido like the Fido in this book. We could play all day long too. Id brush him and cuddle him and he would be my best friend.Well, little Sarah, if you wish hard enough then I can make your dream come true.Can you? Can you really do that Sparkle?Yes, of course. You just have to make your wish. Then I wave my magic wand and your wish will come true. But one thing you must remember that you and I will be the only ones who can see your little dog. When I go back to the woods then little Fido will have to come with me and disappear, just as I disappear.Sarah began to cry again.No, please dont cry Sarah. Dont I come back to visit you all the time? Dont I come into your bedroom at night and sit with you?Yes, but what about Fido? Mummy wont let a dog in the house, ever. She said so. She says they are filthy creatures and smelly too and cost a lot of money to feed.Never mind Sarah. This little Fido is a very special Fido, just like you and me. He is magical. He can come and go as he pleases and he can be seen or not seen.Can we do it now please Sparkle? Can you make magic and bring me a dog like Fido in this book?Yes, of course.Sparkle waved her magic wand and filled the air with more fairy dust. Then out of a cloud of yellow smoke appeared a little black and white dog. His tail wagged so much it looked like a propeller that was about to lift him off the ground.Oh Fido, Fido, you really are here.Fido jumped onto Sarahs lap and licked her face. Sarah began to laugh and cry all at the same time. Fido licked her tears dry and then sat on her lap and fell asleep.Thank you Sparkle, that is the best gift of magic I have ever had. Isnt Fido lovely. Hes all cuddly and warm. I love him to bits.Yes, he is a beautiful dog and very friendly too. Said Sparkle.  When he wakes up, we can go around the garden and play with him.But what if Mummy sees him and tells me off?Ah but your mummy wont be able to see him. Can she see me? Can she see Sparkle?No Mummy has never seen you and that is what is so frustrating. I try to tell Mummy about you but she just wont listen.Well Sarah, when Fido wakes up and we run around the garden together then you can pretend you are just playing by yourself or dancing around the garden pond. I dont think your mummy will mind that at all.No, I think Mummy will be pleased to see me playing on my own for a change and not bothering her all the time. Shall we wake Fido up and have a game of chase or hide and seek? It will soon be time for me to go in for lunch and you will have to go back to the woods and your friends Sparkle.Yes, lets wake Fido up and go and have some fun in your garden and around the pond.Sparkle waved her magic wand over Fidos head and he yawned and stretched his chubby little paws. Sarah put him on the ground and ran over to the pond. Fido ran after her and then put his paws on the side of the pond and looked down at the fish.Whos this? Said a big orange fish.Its my best friend Fido, said Sarah in the softest whisper she could manage.But my fishy friends and I thought we were your best friend, Sarah.Oh, but you are Big Fish but Sparkle said it is all right to have many best friends and so Fido is also my friend.Ah well, if Sparkle says it is okay then it is okay with me, Mr. Big Fish and my best mates here in the pond. Have you got any food for us today Sarah, were a bit hungry?Ill go and get some from Mummy in a minute after Ive played with Fido for a while.Sarah ran around and around the pond. The orange fish swam around and around the edge of the water and tried to keep up. Fido was about to take a short cut and jump over the pond when Sparkle put out her magic wand and stopped him in his tracks.That was close, Said Sarah. If Fido had gone into that water and if I have gone in after him and got all wet and frightened the fish then Mummy would have been so cross, she would probably have grounded me and not given me any lunch or tea today.The shoal of fish swam over to the middle of the pond to rest. Sarah took hold of Fido and stroked him to calm him down. Sparkle sat on the edge of the pond surveying all that she could see.Sarah. Sarah. Are you coming in for your lunch now? Bring your book because I think its going to rain later and we dont want it getting all wet.Coming Mummy. Said Sarah as she ran back to the tree for her book. Im sorry but Ive got to go now Fido and Sparkle. Its been really lovely playing with you today and I will be back tomorrow and we can have another lovely game.Fido ran over to Sarah, jumped up her and licked her face and then disappeared along with Sparkle.Just coming Mummy. Can I feed the fish before I sit down to lunch?Yes, of course. I had forgotten about them.Sarah took the small tin of fish food off the shelf by the back door and ran down the garden to the pond.Here you are Mr. Big Fish and your friends. You wont go hungry today.Thank you Sarah, said Mr. Big Fish. All the orange fish gathered by the edge of the pond and waggled their tails as Sarah waved them goodbye and ran indoors for her lunch.Sit down Sarah. Ive been watching you playing in the garden and Im very pleased that youre back to your old self once more. I knew you were capable of playing on your own. Now here is your favourite lunch. Eat it up and then we can go into town and do some shopping.Thank you Mummy. Can we go to the book store and buy another book?Of course, Sarah. Reading is good for you."
Wildflowers Do Wither,"Sara would get irritated when Shawn mistakenly pulled Saras hair while playing with it. Shawn would kiss her to apologize and Sara would get more irritated. He had improved on his skills. Merely in 5 minutes, he had adorned almost all of Saras lovely hair strands with wildflowers of all colors. Sara was reading her favorite novel lying on her stomach and Shawn was busy playing with her hair. This place by the river side was kind of a hideout. One had to pass through a wide strip of grassland to reach this riverside and once you reached it, there was no view of the other side due to the grass on this land that was also 2 feet high at some places. The grassland opened into a small stretch of a carpet of lush green grass with wildflowers of all the different vibrant colors possible growing all over the place. The sound of the flowing, splashing water only added to the peace and beauty of this riverside. Sara and Shawn had marked this place as their hideout and hangout place. They would take something to drink, sometimes a bottle of their favorite wine, a bottle of water, something to read, a light snack, and a playlist ready with songs that each of them contributed to after long arguments. Their music choices were pretty different; while Sara liked country music, Shawn mostly heard rock and pop. They both would spend hours at this place, sometimes even without speaking much. They both had discovered this place when they were in high school. That summer Sara and Shawn had decided to explore every water body that was bigger than a pool in their neighborhood. They discovered four of these and got a good tan that summer. They used to select an activity every summer that they would do together. They had been doing so for the past 5 years.This day Sara was spending time at their place, but alone. She usually came to this place after Shawn had passed away in an accident that fateful day. Only the place was not a hideout anymore. Although it was not crowded yet, a few people seemed to have discovered the place. Maybe Shawn did not want her to be alone there anymore. People would sit, eat, chit-chat and spend some hours there. Something Sara did not like was that everyone who came would collect a bunch of these small flowers and some ladies would even decorate their hair with these. The act was cute of course, but it evoked some kind of pain in Saras heart; it was like sharing their beautiful tradition with other random people. For this reason in particular Sara mostly kept to herself; she would take their favorite wine along and heard to Shawns playlist with her earbuds on. She wanted to spend this time only with Shawns memories and thus barely tried to connect with the few others present around. Saras days went by really slow after Shawn had gone. She was working on that; she tried meeting friends, spoke more with her family, took up a part-time job, and would always make time for two thingsvisiting the riverside and Shawns tombstone. The latter seemed to impart more peace to Sara than the riverside these days. At least there was no one there to disturb Saras emotional state. Sara would take some wildflowers along to Shawns tombstone every morning she visited it. Somehow, the flowers didnt wither too much. Every time Sara visited, the flowers seemed kind of fresh. This made Sara happy. ***It was a busy day for Sara. She was late today on everything she had planned and thus decided to visit Shawn late that evening. Sara would not miss the visit him any day, no matter what else she had to miss on. She rushed through her day to make time to visit the cemetery. Later in evening as she was entering the cemetery, a teary-eyed girl was leaving. There was a familiar, recognizable aura around her. A very weird feeling crawled under Saras skin. She got goose bumps for no apparent reason. Sara turned around to see if she knew her. She was not someone she knew for sure. Sara began walking towards Shawns tombstone but she stopped and turned backwildflowersthe girl wore a kind of a crown made of wildflowers and held some in her hand. That explained the feeling. Somehow everyone seemed to be fascinated with wildflowers these days, Sara thought to herself. She did not like something so close to her starting to become commonplace. Sara had brought some wine to drink there with Shawn as she was not able to go to the riverside today. She took a peek in her handbag and took it out as she reached the tombstone. She smiled to herself and sat beside the tombstone. Keeping the bottle aside, she started to place the wildflowers she had brought on the tombstone. Her hand stopped halfway and she stared at the fresh flowers placed there already. These were very fresh flowers. Who visited Shawn? Did the woman that was going out put them there? She might have seen my flowers withered and might have placed fresh one while leaving. Sara kept aside some from her own collection and thought that while returning she will place some on the tombstone that the woman might have come to visit as a thank you gesture. She then drank some wine directly from the bottle and left a major portion on the tombstone. After having sat there for a bit, she decided to leave after about an hour when she realized she was running late, again, for her night class. When she came out of the cemetery and started rummaging her bag for her car keys she realize that she had forgotten to offer the flowers that she had decided to do. She was already late, so she thought she will bring some the next day and will place these for sure tomorrow. ***Today Sara visited the riverside in the noon and decided to go to the cemetery in the evening. Sara was happy to see the place all to herself; there was no one there except her. She sat at her favorite spot and took out some eatables and decided to lie down for some time basking in the sun. These kinds of days used to be Shawn and her favorites and lying down was all that they did on such sunny days. She was happy to not load her ears with earbuds for a change today. It had been about an hour when she could hear some ladies chuckling. They might have just come to the place. Sara felt too lazy to move so she lay there with her eyes closed feeling the warm sun on her body. She slowly drifted into a dream about Shawn playing with her hair and speaking about how beautiful she was.Sara, you know right?Umhmnn said Sara.You dont even know what I am talking about, Shawn would laugh.I am too lazy to think and speaksomaybe.Hmn. But you look beautiful even when you are lazy, and then Shawn kissed her.Thats not the way he made that crown, one of the girls said and Sara came out of her dream. She opened one of her eyes and saw hazy images of three girls walking past her spot. She closed it back and wanted to continue her dream. After 5 minutes, Sara opened her eyes wide abruptly as if in shock. She jumped up and wildly looked around for those girls. She had realized it might have been the same woman from the cemetery among the three ladies that just passed by. No one was around. They were maybe leaving when they passed across her. Sara also left after some time.In the evening, as planned Sara went to the cemetery with extra wildflowers. As she was walking towards the tombstone, she saw the same woman sitting at Shawns tombstone muttering something while one older lady stood beside her. The lady sitting was young and beautiful. They might have known Shawn. Then the woman placed some wildflowers on the tombstone and made a quick crown-like thing out of some of the flowers and placed them on her own head. Sara stood there watching this from a distance. She didnt want to get any closer. Sara stood there watching, her feet glued to the ground during this time and as they walked past her. This was the same woman who visited yesterday with tears in her eyesshe might have been close to him. How did she know about the wildflowersand the riverside. The riverside was our hideout. Who might she have been to come visit both these places after Shawn? Shawn never mentioned anything to me about anyone so close to him. The women also mentioned on the riverside yesterday that he made the crown a certain way; was she referring to Shawn? Sara managed to pull her feet out of the earth beneath her foot and started walking towards Shawns tombstone. Then in the hope to see the wildflowers placed on some other tomb too that the woman might have actually come to visit, Sara went through the whole cemetery but could not find any wildflowers on any other tombstone. She did come to visit Shawnevery single day. This was the reason that the flowers did not wither.Sara turned around and headed out of the cemetery to see if the ladies had left as she wanted some answers. As she reached outside, the woman with the wildflower crown was already headed back inside; she had Shawns favorite wine in her hand. She might have forgotten to offer this earlier. Sara ran towards the older woman instead as she somehow did not want to confront the lady with the crown; wildflowers felt scary all of a sudden. Sara jumped towards the old lady and almost scared her into a halt. How did you know Shawn, mam? I saw you visiting him here, Sara asked bluntly.Oh! I did not know him as well as my daughter knew him. The lady again started walking while speaking. They both wanted to have kids together. The lady kept walking while Sara stood there dumbstruck. Sara walked backwards until she hit a wall on her back. The tears that she did not allow to flow were now rolling down unabated. She slid down with her back against the wall and sat on the floor, her folded legs locked in her arms and face hidden behind her knees. She held tight onto herself as if she was preventing something broken from shattering into pieces. I thought those were just my wildflowers! I thought you were just mine! She cried out loud, losing her breath several times in between, she sobbed and then cried copiously and then sobbed, sporadically.Although the cemetery did not see Sara again, Shawns tombstone always had offerings of wildflowers; only now the flowers withered sooner."
Live And Let Live,"She moved on and on. It seemed she was sailing in the air. She felt so light. It was so foggy. She could only see white fumes around her. Where was she going? What had happened to her? She could not recall anything. But she liked this journey. There was something new and exciting in store for her. Excitement always made her sleepy. She moved downwards. Her feet touched the ground. Her hands touched a trunk of the tree. Taking its support, she sat down. Soon she fell into a deep sleep. When her eyes opened, it was dawn. There was little visibility. A cool breeze was blowing. There were sounds of twittering, chirping, cooing and so many other which she could not identify. She looked all around with wonder in her eyes. She was not in her room. This hard surface was not her bed. There were only trees and bushes around her. She could smell pleasant fragrance of fresh flowers. The place looked very beautiful and colorful. There were so many flowers of different kinds all around. She only had roses, marigold, dahlia and sunflower in her garden. She could identify only some flowers whose pictures she had seen in her science book. She could identify mahua, achar and bamboo only. All other plants were new for her. Wherever she was, the place was very refreshing. She looked around and asked herself, Where am I? You are in the woods of Kanha In Madhya Pradesh. came a sweet voice. She looked around. She could not see anyone around. But she was sure that she had heard some clear sounds. You mean Kanha National Park forest. I was sleeping in my house in Delhi. How could I reach Kanha forest? You always wanted to visit this place. Why? Because Ive read so much about it in The Jungle Book. Im a fan of Rudyard Kipling who wrote this book. This forest is called Kiplings world that powered him with such magnificent imaginations. The vegetative attractions are a perfect habitat for jungle beings. I love wildlife. But who are you? I cant see you. Im Sweeto the peacock. I live in this jungle. Hello Sweeto. Im Kavya. I am twelve years old and live in Delhi. My parents are not around so lets give company to each other till they come. First you tell me what you people know about this jungle. Well, Kanha National Park is the largest national park in Madhya Pradesh. 300 species of birds are found in this wood. Some of these birds are migratory. It is a home to 200 species of flowering plants. The barasingha or the swamp deer is the most popular animal of this forest. Other animals found here are Royal Bengal Tiger, leopards, sloth bears, sambhars, chitals, gaur and Indian wild dog. Along with these we can also see porcupine, jungle cat, fox, jackal, mongoose, python and monkey. Kavya was happy to share her knowledge with Sweeto and felt elated because she was talking to a peacock. It was unbelievable. I think I should introduce you to all my friends in this jungle. Youd love meeting them and talking to them. Sweeto offered to show her the jungle. What about my mummy and daddy. They will be worried when they dont see me here.I will send a signal to all my jungle friends. They will help me locate them. When they come back for you, theyll inform me and well come back. Okay, lets go My friend, Fifi, the python lives in this hole. Oh! Ive never seen a real python. Lets go to his hole. Fifi, the python was very huge and long. He was dark grey with big black spots all over his body. He looked very handsome. Kavya expressed her pleasure in meeting him. He offered to accompany them around the jungle. Leepy, the monkey noticed the peacock and python moving around with a human being. He didnt like human beings. Men often came to the jungle to catch monkeys. They dressed them in human clothes, tied a rope around their neck and forced them to act and dance. Small children like that human being clapped and laughed at them. He felt so humiliated for his friends who actually faced all this. Sweeto, what are you doing? Why are you being friendly with human beings? They have never been nice to us. Leepy expressed his frustration. Hello, Leepy. Meet my friend Kavya. I dont want to meet her. Why are you angry with me. What have I done? Weve not even met yet. You humans are very bad. You exploit all the animals. You cut our jungles and make us homeless. You catch animals and force them to perform feats so that you can entertain yourself. Leepy exploded. Im really very sorry. I apologize on behalf of all the human beings. We think were very intelligent and resourceful but actually were senseless. We use all the natural resources for ourselves. We get crazy and greedily use everything. Time comes when we realize that were ruthlessly exploiting our resources. Weve understood now that we dont have copyright on this earth. We should share the resources with all the living beings. Fifi supported Kavya and said, Cant you see how human beings are making up for the damage theyve done. Theyve reserved jungles and protected them from damage. Our jungle is a protected area and National Park now. See how happily we all animals live together. Men are planting more trees as theyve realized their importance. Number of animals are increasing. Okay no more complaints now, said Sweeto. Leepy can you swing from one branch to another using your tail. Ive seen monkeys do this trick on T.V. Can you show me how you actually do it? said Kavya. Leepy was more than happy to do this trick. It was his favorite. He even plucked a fresh mango from the tree and gave it to Kavya. She jumped with joy. She clapped to see Leepy swinging on the tree. Youre absolutely amazing Leepy. He smiled to hear the appreciation. Hearing all this, Sheru, the lion woke up. Why is there so much commotion at this time? You know it is my sleeping time, the lion growled.Weve a guest in this jungle. Though shes a human being, she has made us realize that man is now using available resources judiciously. He is also implementing various schemes to increase these resources, said Sweeto. Its nice to know this. Please take care of her. Show her the whole jungle. Feed her on fruits and hunted animals. Oh! Sorry, I think you eat cooked meat. Youd not eat raw meat like we do, said Sheru. Thanks for being so considerate. I dont eat meat at all. So, no problem, Kavya expressed her gratitude. Sheru said, Since it is very bright, Ill go to sleep. Report to me what you did for her to make her feel comfortable. Yes, Your Majesty, chorused all the animals together. Kavya was surprised to see all this. Humans thought that only humans could communicate. But the animals were talking to her in her language. This must have happened for the first time in this world. She smiled. Kavya, why are you smiling? Why dont you get up? Its time for school. If you dont get up just now, youll get late. This was her mothers voice. Why was she scolding her in the forest? She looked around. Her eyes opened. She was in her room. Oh! God this was just a dream. Visiting her favorite forest, talking to animals and going around in the jungle was just a dream. So, she hadnt talked to animals. It was just a fairy tale."
Shoes,"In the town of Dartmoor England lived a young shoemaker Patrick. He worked diligently on his families legacy to be the best shoemaker of all times. He had his heart set on marrying a young lass named Alane.To impress Alane he worked on making her the best shoes possible. The leather was as soft as her touch and would keep her feet warm like her personality. He found the perfect blue dye to make bows that would match her eyes. The morning came for him to present his shoes and ask her hand in marriage. When he got to his work bench he found the shoes had all fallen apart. Upon closer inspections he noticed the sewing had been undone. Patrick figured it must have been the farmer that wanted her hand trying to demolish his plans. He spent the day redoing what had been undone.The next morning the shoes were undone once more. With a heavy heart he went back to work fixing the shoes up once more. Before Patrick went to bed he sprinkled the floor and counter top with flour in hopes to find out who it was that meant to destroy his plans.The third morning Patrick went to check on the shoes and found they had once again been taken apart. Upon looking around in the flour dust he did not notice any shoe prints or smudges from someone leaning on the desk or walking up to it. None of this tools had moved, instead he saw three sets of small footprints on the counter.I know who you are now. Patrick turned slowly around shaking his fists. Pixies!Pixies used to take his Dads horses out of the barn and tangle up their main and tails. They would hide things from his Mother in the kitchen. Though never had they destroyed anything. The pixies stopped their pranks when his parents had passed away.Taking note of the foot prints Patrick went to work on making three sets of small shoes to fit those prints left behind. He fixed up Alanes shoes once more vowing that he would not have to remake them a fourth time. He set up a small hut that had a tiny mirror in it. This hut was a cage that when entered the door could be locked from the outside therefore trapping the pixies inside. Once caught, Patrick would put them to work to make up time lost of redoing the shoes.Before nightfall Patrick set the tiny shoes on the counter and made him a nice place to watch for them pesky pixies to come back. He felt his head nod as sleep was trying to take over. A small squeak caught his attention.  Little pointed ears, beady small eyes, leaves for clothes, and acorn hats. They seemed to have admired the shoes. One by one they put them on as if checking to see if they were cursed or something.Patrick slowly stood up with the hut outstretched in his hands. Would you like to see how they look?One pixie vanished, the other two froze.Come on there is a little mirror in here you can go and check out how they look on yourselves.  Patrick pointed at the hut.Its some kind of trick. The tallest pixie said.He seems harmless. The shortest pixie looked Patrick up and down. He never did anything to us when he was child.He found our tricks funny. The third pixie reappeared. Put that hut down on the table, back away, and we will go check out our shoes.Patrick placed the hut on the table. Once all the pixies were inside Patrick waited for the opportunity to lock them in. He heard them chatting in excitement about how the shoes looked and felt on their feet. Patrick reached as fast as he could and snapped the door shut. He pulled off the outer hut to reveal the pixies were in a cage.With a tapping foot and crossed arms, I knew this was some kind of trick. The tallest pixie grumbled.Patrick shook his head. I had to do something to stop you.It was all fun and games. We didnt mean to upset you. Smirked the shortest pixie.You three work for me for the next week making shoes the right way to make up for my time lost remaking these and I will let you go. Patrick paced backed and forth.The three pixies huddled in a tight circle discussing things among themselves. Every couple of minutes one would poke its head up and glare at Patrick. Patrick knew it was just them trying to get him worked by using up all his time while waiting. They were probably up to no good and scheming to get pay backs. He knew not to let his guard down anytime soon.The huddle broke up and the three pixies stood in line. The tallest pixie stood as tall as he could get. We will only sew for four days and then you wont see us again.Whats the catch? Patrick raised his brows.No catch. We wasted four days of your time making you redo these shoes. We will sew for only four days then move on to someone else who is more fun to pick on.I open this cage and you will stick around to help and not disappear? Patrick grabbed the door.The three pixies nodded at each other then at Patrick.Patrick opened the cage door and expected them to take off. They calmly walked out and started to sew some leather together that had already been cut. In disbelief Patrick went back to work.Patrick? Alanes voice rang out. Patrick you here?Patrick covered up the shoes quickly so that Alane would not see her shoes. Ill be right out.He ran around the work shop and house looking for Alane. He did not find her anywhere. He heard laughing and his ears being pulled. Patrick knew then it was the pixies. He tried to run his hands through his hair and was stopped by all the small knots in it.Patrick went back to his workshop and finished up with Alanes shoes. The pixies were gone. Patrick never saw them again."
The Wood Fairies and the Rainbow,"The story I am about to tell you happened a great many years ago, so it is well you listen up so it is not forgotten. It happened one early morning when the first light peeps through, when the birds in the forest begin to welcome their new day. When the darkness of the night is lifting and it is time to rejoice in the arrival of a new day. It is at the beginning, at the break of day that the  the Wood Fairies ) return to their fortified village amongst the bush-clad slopes of the cloudy summit of Mount Pirongia. These white skinned little people i.e. fairies are feared because they are dangerous to mortals. It was one such morning when a young man named Uenuku set out to hunt while the mist hung low in the valley. As he walks he is recalling the oft told stories spoken by the older village people about the wood fairies who live on the summit and travel in the covering of the mist. [In appearance some appear like us Maori people; others resembled the (or white) race; blue eyed similar to fair-skinned Europeans, while some had reddish hair  their fair complexion (especially the ladies)  meant early Europeans encountering them dubbed them waka blondes. Their clothing was mainly a flax garment dyed a red colour, or a rough mat type of garment. Spoken of as peaceful not angry, but having a dread of steam which would rise from cooking pots (they themselves ate mostly raw food) the would retreat to their houses and shut themselves up.]He wonders are there eyes out there now peering through the mist at him; he gives an involuntary shiver at his thought. He continues to trek the pathway leading higher up Mt Pirongia, thinking when he should start to hunt, when there is the sound of a flute. He stops, holds his breath straining his ears and hears the sound again, yes, the sound of a flute. He recalls his grandfather telling him,To stay home lest the fairy folk of the forest get you; the men play the flute, and some of their women are beautiful with blue eyes, but rather shy.The mist begins to lift as Uenuku stops to rest turning his head to the bush by his side, and there steering back at him are a pair of blue/green eyes! He steers, then putting his hand through the bush he draws out a beautiful fair skinned lady. He knows immediately she has to be a wood fairy but is not able to speak, because he is captivated by what is happening  Uenuku, is looking at female beauty not seen before. Eventually he talks, telling her who he is and why he is on the mount early in the morning. She listens letting him speak of himself, but speaks very little of herself. The story is that Uenuku didnt hunt much that day, instead he walked with his fair maiden higher into the covering of the mist and there declared his love. She promises to come to him each evening but,As a wood fairy who lives in the covering of the mist, I will need to return to the mountain before daybreak. Uenuku is stricken by her, and over a period of time they marry and a baby girl is born, but still his mist maiden would only stay the night, vanishing with the mist in the morning.Uenuku tells his friends of his wife and child but because they cant see her, there is unbelief, and he is disappointed. One day he decides to cover the house windows to block out the morning sunlight but his mist maiden is alert to his trickery and leaves with their girl for good. For many days in fact years Uenuku went searching for them, beyond Mount Pirongia, asking of his people for the places that the  the Wood Fairies are known to live. Wandering lonely from new village to another without success he became old and tired, regretting the way he mishandled the love of his mist maiden those years past. As he wandered throughout the land, the Sky Father took pity on him and decided to turn him into a rainbow so he could join his family in the sky! Life, is a gift and everything we are given is a gift and the best way to manage our gifts is to know the wisdom of holding lightly to what we are given. Uenuku, was given the gift of meeting his mist maiden and through his meeting find the seed of loving another more than himself. Though he managed this for a time he let the need to be first have power thus planning to entrap his mist maiden from being herself and her need to return to the sky. A Biblical poetic expressed his troubles this way; Weeping may remain during the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning. May the light of each new day bring joy into our hearts and brighten the lives of those we share our living with. It can be with much searching we go about seeking what we have lost, when it can be as simple as being prepared to forgive, the wrongs of others. We are not meant to plan revenge or to repay with our form of justice. We are to ask and seek forgiveness of our own errors and for those we have hurt or wronged and commit the correct justification to the wisdom of the Creator of Life. When we experience what is described as darkness of the night (difficult days) remember the chorus of the birds in the morning and the rainbow and turn dark thoughts into songs of joy. Word Count: 965 [Maori legend suggests that it is not just cold weather that makes one shudder or shiver on Hihikiwi. It is one of the ancient ancestral homes of the Patupaiarehe (people of the mists). These fairy-like folk will only travel in the dark or under the cover of mists. Travellers caught by heavy mists or by nightfall, would have the eerie sensation they were being watched by a thousand unseen eyes  enough to make the bravest a little nervous.Notes:Pirongia is one of the mountains associated in Maori lore with the Patupairehe who were white-skinned little people (fairies), usually feared, for they were dangerous to mortals. The Patupairehe were supposed to inhabit large fortified villages in the cloudy summits of the hills, and frequented certain localities throughout New Zealand, even as far south as Foveaux Strait. At times their presence was revealed in the ghostly piping of flutes and the sound of fairy songs heard in the misty forest heights.]Pirongia Mountain, from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A.

The Peony Princess,"Many years ago at Gamogun, in the province of Omi, was a castle called Adzuchi-no-Shiro. It was a magnificent old place, surrounded by walls and a moat filled with lotus lilies. The feudal lord was a very brave and wealthy man, Yuki Naizen-no-jo. His wife had been dead for some years. He had no son; but he had a beautiful daughter aged eighteen, who was given the title of Princess. For a considerable period, there had been peace and quiet in the land; the feudal lords were on the best of terms, and everyone was happy.            Amid these circumstances Lord Naizen-no-jo perceived that there was a good opportunity to find a husband for his daughter Princess Aya; and after a time the second son of the Lord of Ako, of Harima Province, was selected, to the satisfaction of both fathers, the affair having little to do with the principals. Lord Ako's second son had viewed his bride with approval, and she, him. One may say that young people are bound to approve of each other when it is the parents' wish that they be united. Many suicides result from this.Princess Aya made her mind up to try and love her prospective husband. She saw nothing of him; but she thought of him, and talked of him.               One evening when Princess Aya was walking in the magnificent gardens by the moonlight, accompanied by her maids-in-waiting, she wandered down through her favourite peony bed to the pond where she loved to gaze at her reflection on the nights of the full moon, to listen to frogs, and to watch the fireflies.When nearing the pond her foot slipped, and she would have fallen into the water had it not been that a young man appeared as if by magic and caught her. He disappeared as soon as he had put her on her feet again. The maids-of-honour saw her slip; they saw a glimmer of light, and that was all; but Princess Aya had seen more. She had seen the most handsome young man she could imagine. 'Twenty-one years old,' she said to O Sadayo San, her favourite maid, 'he must have beena samurai of the highest order. His dress was covered with my favourite flowers,  peonies, and his swords were richly mounted. Oh that I could have seen him a minute longer, to thank him for saving me from the water! Who can he be? And how could he have got into our gardens, through all the guards?'              So spoke the Princess to her maids, directing them at the same time that they were to say a word to no one, for fear that her father should hear, find the young man, and behead him for trespass.              After this evening Princess Aya fell sick. She could not eat or sleep and turned pale. The day for her marriage with the young Lord of Ako came and went without the event; she was far too sick for that. The best of the doctors had been sent from Kyoto, which was then the capital; but none of them had been able to do anything, and the maid grew thinner and thinner.               As a last resource, the Lord Naizen-no-jo, her father, sent for her most confidential maid and friend, O Sadayo, and demanded if she could give any reason for his daughter's mysterious sickness. Had she a secret lover? Had she a particular dislike for her betrothed?               'Sir,' said O Sadayo, 'I do not like to tell secrets; but here it seems my duty to your lordship's daughter as well as to your lordship. Some three weeks ago, when the moon was at its full, we were walking in the peony beds down near the pond where the Princess loves to be. She stumbled and nearly fell into the water when a strange thing happened. In an instant a most beautiful young samurai appeared and held her up, thus preventing her from falling into the pond. We could all see the glimmer of him, but your daughter and I saw him most distinctly. Before your daughter could thank him he had disappeared. None of us could understand how it was possible for a man to get into the gardens of the Princess, for the gates of the castle are guarded on all sides, and the Princess's garden is so much better guarded than the rest that it seems truly incredible that a man could get in. We maids were asked to say nothing for fear of your lordship's anger. Since that evening it is that our beloved Princess Aya has been sick, sir. It is sickness of the heart. She is deeply in love with the young samurai she saw for so brief space. Indeed, my lord, there never was such a handsome man in the world before, and if we cannot find him the young Princess, I fear, will die.'            'How is it possible for a man to get into the grounds?' said Lord Yuki Naizen-no-jo. 'People say foxes and badgers assume the figures of men sometimes; but even so, it is impossible for such supernatural beings to enter my castle grounds, guarded as it is at every opening.'              That evening the poor Princess was more wearily unhappy than ever before. Thinking to enliven her a little, the maids sent for a celebrated player on the biwa, called Yashaskita Kengyo. The weather being hot, they were sitting on the gallery (engawa); and while the musician was playing 'Dannoura' there appeared suddenly from behind the peonies the same handsome young samurai. He was visible to all this timeeven to the peonies embroidered on his dress.            'There he is! there he is!' they cried; at which he instantly disappeared again. The Princess was highly excited, and seemed more lively than she had been for days; the old Daimio grew more puzzled than ever when he heard of it.Next night, while two of the maids were playing for their mistressO Yae San the flute, and O Yakumo the kotothe figure of the young man appeared again. A thorough search having been made during the day in the immense peony beds with absolutely no result, not even the sign of a footmark, the thing was increasingly strange. A consultation was held, and it was decided by the lord of the castle to invite a veteran officer of great strength and renown, Maki Hiogo, to capture the youth should he appear that evening. Maki Hiogo readily consented, and at the appointed time, dressed in black and consequently invisible, concealed himself among the peonies.            Music seemed to have a fascination for the young samurai. It was while music was being played that he had made his appearances. Consequently, O Yae and O Yakumo resumed their concert, while all gazed eagerly towards the peony beds. As the ladies played a piece called 'Sofuren,' there, sure enough, arose the figure of a young samurai, dressed magnificently in clothes which were covered with embroidered peonies. Everyone gazed at him, and wondered why Maki Hiogo did not jump up and catch him. The fact was that Maki Hiogo was so much astonished by the noble bearing of the youth that at first, he did not like to touch him. Recovering himself, and thinking of his duty to his lord, he stealthily approached the young man, and, seizing him round the waist, held him tight. After a few seconds, Maki Hiogo felt a kind of wet steam falling on his face; by degrees, it made him faint; and he fell to the ground, still grasping the young samurai, for he had made up his mind that he would secure him. Everyone had seen the scuffle, and some of the guards came hurrying to the place. Just as they reached the spot Maki Hiogo came to his senses and shouted 'Come, gentlemen! I have caught him. Come and see!' But on looking at what he held in his arms he discovered it to be only a large peony!             By this time the Lord Naizen-no-jo had arrived at the spot where Maki Hiogo lay, and so had the Princess Aya and her maids. All were astounded and mystified except the Daimio himself, who said:             'Ah! it is as I said. No fox or badger spirit could pass our guards and get into this garden. It is the spirit of the peony flower that took the form of a prince.' Turning to his daughter and her maids, he said: 'You must take this as a compliment, and pay great respect to the peony, and show the one caught by Maki Hiogo kindness as well by taking care of it.'              Princess Aya carried the flower back to her room as a sign of love from him and put it in a vase of water and placed it near her pillow. She felt as if she had her sweetheart with her. Day by day she got better. She tended the peony herself, and, strange to say, the flower seemed to get stronger and stronger, instead of fading. At last, the Princess recovered. She became radiantly beautiful, while the peony continued to remain in perfect bloom, showing no sign of dying.             Princess Aya being now perfectly well, her father could no longer put off the wedding. Consequently, some days later, the Lord of Ako and his family arrived at the Castle, and his second son was married to the Princess.                As soon as the wedding was over the peony was found still in its vasebut dead and withered. The villagers always after this, instead of speaking of the Princess Aya, or Aya Hime, called her Botan Hime or Peony Princess."
Some Days .......,"Snow melting at last, the harsh bitter cold and storms finally gone and over, the morning air crisp but the afternoon sun warm and inviting. It was March end in the Colorado mountains, snow capped mountains still breathing - always snow in the high hills here. But now, signs of life and change in weather made the promise of a beautiful summer ahead. Leon Black and his wife, Joanne, lived in the tiny village, had a small cottage home with some nice acreage around them, she loved her garden and he loved to do his word working outside with the garage door open and his radio blaring out the oldies as he sang out to his favoriate songs.After lunch, Joanne brought out a pitcher of sweet tea, with the thin slices of lemon floating on the darkly brewed liquid, lots of sugar stirred in, oh, Leon loved his sweet Southern tea. His mother used to make it for him back home in Tennesee, when the summers were so hot even the dogs just lay there in the shade trying not to move, the four hunting animals his daddy had gotten to get rid of the foxes. He sighed with contentment, thinking of the old days back on the farm, the chickens and collecting eggs were his chore, the two big work horses kept in the barn were daddy's and the boys, strong and muscular. ""Ahhh, this is more like it, glad to see another winter gone."" He said to Joanne as she began to darn a basket of old socks. She smiled nodding, ""The garden has to be weeded and raked through so we can start planting the vegetables."" She reminded him, nodding toward the rake she'd brought out yesterday. ""I hope we get a good crop this summer, corn and tomatoes bring in some xtra money."" She said tiredly, they were not young anymore, her back had started to bother her last winter. ""do u want some ligament? I have a jar in the bottom of the pantry downstairs."" He asked her, as she rubbed her neck and shoulders.""No, you just rest, maybe later after supper I will go down and start getting the seeds ready, - oh look, the hummingbirds are back."" She pointed happily, as two of them fluttered around, looking for the little bowls of sugar water to feed on. Joanne could just sit and watch those little tiny things forever, the rythmic pattern of their wings as they dove in, drank the sweet water and dove out, repeating the pattern. She leaned back in her rocker and continued to darn the socks.""I am going to build a fence around the chickens soon, foxes are going to be this year apparently. Anton said so down at the hardware store. he says, Leon, those little critters are gonna eat up all your chickens."" He told me, and I got the wire for a good price too."" Leon added proud.""And you just gotta believe everything he tells you."" Joanne frowned, if it were up to her husband they would be in the poor house. Joanne secretly kept a jar hidden and was saving up for emergencies, adding to the jar now filled with bills and spare change, Joanne was smart and frugal.""Oh now, dont you worry, itsn't it better to be safe now than sorry later? He beamed at her and drank down his tea.""Oh I just love Spring, soon the land will be filled with wildflowers, birds, the lakes will be warm, the rivers full. I think this is my fav time of the year."" Joanne sighed contendly, her soul filled with joy and the lingering memories of winter behind her now, no more shivering getting up and getting wood in the stove. No more wrapping up with old quilts at night to keep warm, and listening to the wind howling outside the windows, pounding in her eardrums at night keeping her awake as she huddled in her big soft bed next to Leon. She'd met him years before, and on their first date Leon proposed to her, she thought he was plum crazy!! ""What? You have to be kidding right? We hardly know each other! She exclaimed as he knelt down and proposed at the restaurant.""I know that, I also know you are the most beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on and we will have an entire life to get to know each other."" He announced boldly, grinnng from ear to ear. He held her hand and kissed it gently, how could she say no? It was 1947, not unusual for women to marry and have a family - she couldnt live at home forever and had finished her high school year.And so, they had married, had three children who were now living on their own, one in college and two married - no grandkids yet, but that was good, Joanne just wanted them to be happy and healthy, and she had a great marriage for the most part, living in Colorado, enduring the harsh cold winters waiting for Spring, spending summer gardening and farming so they could earn enough to survive through the next winter, and so, that was how it went. The life was peaceful, steady, aside from the usual town gossip and the church ladies creating drama, that is the life they shared, and now when Spring came, it was a welcome to see the sunshine warming their land, the birdsong in the air and the blossom of apple trees filling the sky with their pretty pinkness.	They would never trade this life for any other really, what would living in the city be like for them now?  None of the beauty and calmness that country living offered them, that was one thing Joanne knew.  She darned her socks awhile longer, pulling her hair back into a pony tail, still long at her age, and getting up to start dinner.  The windows were opened for fresh air, ""And dont forget to get out the rags and help me clean these windows now."" Joanne reminded her husband, who now had his eyes closed and softly snoring in the warmth of the sun on their veranda.  She smiled."

The Forests Heart,"She took her first breath in a grove of towering aspen trees, under the shadow of a hummingbirds wing. Her mother was the melody of the mountain stream and her father was the glitter of sunlight through the coin-shaped leaves.The forest cared for her, swaddled her in wildflowers and sustained her with birdsong. When she cried, the butterflies kissed her cheeks and dried her tears. She grew strong and fast, and in only a few years she was taller than the saplings that sprouted on the day of her birth.When the nights were cold, she slept beside the fawns, curled up against their spotted backs while their mothers sang lullabies and told stories. On warm spring evenings, she lay on beds of moss and sweet-smelling fallen leaves.She played with the bluebirds, who taught her to sing. She raced the coyote pups along dry stream beds. On rainy days when the earth smelled of sky, she wandered down to the mountain lake and swam with the river otters.She lived a contented life for many years in the little grove. The woods and the mountainside loved her dearly, knew the sound of her footsteps and the touch of her fingers. Even the most fearsome creatures were tame in her presence. The bears told her where to find the sweetest honey. The chorus of wolves sang her dirges in hollow harmony, hoping to see her smile. Even the mountain lion tipped his regal head in her direction as he stalked by in search of prey.She was the forests very heart.One day, she awoke to strange sounds in the woods. Voices, clumsy and ill-defined, not lofty like birdsong or steady like a does murmur. She climbed to the top of an old pine tree, who straightened with joy at her touch.A man and his son rambled through the woods, snapping limbs from sapling trees and trampling larkspur underfoot. The man was tall and thin, and the boy stood about the girls height, with a smile cool as a riverbed stone.She watched all day from a distance as they cleared a space in the aspen grove to make camp, gathered wood, made a fire, pulled fish from the lake with a stick and a string and roasted them over the flames.When night fell, the forest held a hushed conference about the strangers. The nervous squirrels chittered, the bucks stamped their hooves, and the owls quieted everyone down to warn them: no one was to go near these trespassers, especially not the girl.The next morning, the girl licked dewdrops from the wild mint leaves and wandered the woods, avoiding the spot where the man and his son lay sleeping. She hummed to herself as she walked, and did not notice the boy, who had risen at the sound of her song and followed it.Whats your name? he asked as he approached, and the forest grew deathly still.The girl did not have a name. She did not know what names were. There was no use for such things in the forest, for the creatures knew one another too intimately for names.Your name? he asked again, slowly.She shrugged.He frowned. Im Liam.Liam, she replied, letting the word fall from her tongue like overripe berries from a vine.He nodded and stepped towards her, hand outstretched. In his palm rested a hand-carved wooden rabbit, one of the most beautiful and strange things shed ever seen. Hesitantly, knowing that the disapproving trees were watching, she snatched the rabbit from him and dashed away, vanishing into the woods.The man and his son stayed in the grove one more day. Neither caught a glimpse of the girl in that time, and the man was quite convinced that his son had dreamed her.But Liam knew the truth, and so did the forest.After the trespassers left, the girl clung tightly to the wooden rabbit and whispered her wishes in its ears. The creatures in the forest told her to forget the boy, begged her to join their games. For weeks, she could not bring herself to do either.A year passed, and somewhere in that time the girl nearly forgot Liam. She left the wooden rabbit under the old pine tree. She played once more with the otters and sang with the sparrows. The forest was whole again, whole and happy.Then, Liam and his father returned.This time, the girl was bolder and met Liam in the grove while his father fished down at the lake. He didnt look up from the fire when she appeared, he only smiled into the gentle flames.I knew you were real, he whispered.She smiled back.Liam and his father returned to the woods once every spring. Each year, much to the forests chagrin, Liam and the girl stole a moment together beneath the shade of the pine branches, nestled in the scent of fallen needles that clung to their skin.They talked and they laughed. The girl came to love speaking in Liams clumsy language, just as he came to love how well she knew the forest, how deeply she belonged to it.The third year they met, Liam stole a kiss from the girl under the pine tree.The fourth year, the girl stole two kisses and Liam stole a caress of the girls wildflower skin.One day after many years of stealing kisses, they stole much more from one another, and lingered in the shade of the pine tree in a breathless reverie.Shortly after that day, Liam and his father departed the woods again. The girl fell ill. The forest did not scold, only sighed at the inevitability of it all and nursed her as best as it could. In time, she grew better and stronger. She grew fuller, too, and felt the terrifying exhilaration of life within her.She bore a child under the shade of the aspen trees, a daughter with wildflower skin and eyes full of wishes. The girl gave her daughter the little wooden rabbit to play with and when spring came, the two of them waited under the pine tree for Liams return.When he did return, this time without his father, his cool smile did not last long. His countenance grew dark at the sight of his daughter, sleeping in a bed of pine needles. He knew that this child, like her mother, was not human, not quite. And that knowledge made him tremble.Liam could not hear the girls voice over the sound of fear, rushing in white rapids within his ears. He raged, more at himself than at the girl, but the forest heard and bristled at his fury. The girl did not weep, did not plead as he turned and started back down the mountainside. She simply picked up her daughter and left the shade of the pine tree for the last time with a soft goodbye.The girl could forgive and forget, but the forest could not.Liam did not make it down the mountain.When the girl discovered what the forest had done, she went out in search of Liams body, thinking she might bury the man she loved under the pine tree where she loved him. She left her daughter beside the fawns in the tender care of the aspen grove where she was raised, promising to return.She searched for days. The forest would not tell her where he lay, so she wandered in aimless grief. With gentle chirps, the birds cautioned her to go back to her daughter. The wolves invited her to add her loss to their somber song and allow herself to heal. The mountain lion said nothing, merely nuzzled her hand and pointed her home.Still, she did not stop searching for Liam. The forest wept for her, with her, bitter tears of regret and love.When she found him, lying in a field of larkspur and thistles with his eyes open to the sun, she stood over him with tears in her eyes.The very heart of the forest lay down beside the man she loved did not rise.Year after year and even to this day, all the creatures of the forest gather at the edge of that field in early spring. They bring with them the girls daughter, to show her the wildflowers which bloom over the place where her parents lie."
Aidan of the Wood,"TW: abuseAidan didnt know why he was beaten. He just was.Although he did get better at dodging his uncles sharp blows and his aunts resounding slaps, they seemed to rain down on him like an Irish summer storm. Their scads of children would laugh to see such a sight, pointing at him because he was dirty or his tunic torn. Not hard to tear a tunic in the potato fields, where brambles and thorns seem to seek out his thin legs and inflame the crusty sores on his shins with malevolent intent.It was far harder not to eat the potatoes he dug, knowing that would have earned himself another beating. To Aidan, it always seemed like he was hungry or lost in thought. It had been years since Aidans parents had been lost. Along with them, his former life of love, compassion and understanding had been replaced by one of indifference, apathy, and scorn.At a time when a young boy needed encouragement and guidance, Aidan was left to himself. When he wasnt being forced to harvest food he wasnt allowed to eat, he would steal away to the wood where the hustle and bustle of animals going about their business would calm his troubled heart. He especially loved to sit and watch the squirrels play, scurrying up trees and watching everything happening all throughout the wood.On an early summer day when the earth seemed full of promise, Aidan left the hovel of his Aunt and Uncles and stole away to the wood. The loam was rich and sun-warmed under his feet. He loved skipping over the soft moss and picking up cool smooth rocks which seemed to greet him. He drank from a spring and found a fertile blueberry bush, gathering a generous harvest. A black walnut tree offered him a bounty for his feast, which he ate as he gloried in the speckled sunshine and the quiet.For a moment, Aidan found a bit of peace in the world.Aidan, a soft voice said. I need your help.There are few things more disconcerting than being alone in a wood and hearing a disembodied voice. Especially when the voice knows your name. Maybe it was his innate goodness or maybe it was just because of his youth, but Aidan immediately responded.Id be happy to help in any way I can, he said earnestly. What can I do for you?No sooner had the words left his mouth when Aidan was overcome by a feeling of ridiculousness. There was no one there but a small red squirrel, and Aidan knew squirrels could not talk. But in Ireland, things were not always so settled.Im down here, said the red squirrel, flicking its tail.Oh, Aidan said, crouching down to its level. What is your name?Im Ratatoskr, but you can call me Drill-tooth. The red squirrel politely offered its paw, which Aidan dutifully shook.I would like to help you, Drill-tooth.Then help me you will. I am to take the terrible things of the world from the eagle atop of The World Tree to the serpent under its root. I have seen you dig potatoes in your Uncles field. I need your help to dig for the serpent.Is the serpent terrifying? asked Aidan.The serpent is not terrifying. He only holds that which is most dear to us.I dont understand, Aidan said.You will. Come along, said Drill-tooth, as he led Aidan to the base of a very old, very large tree. Around the base of The World Tree were very tiny claw marks that Aidan instantly recognized as the work of his new friend.It became quite clear why Drill-tooth needed Aidan. If the tiny squirrel were to be forced to dig alone, it would take more than one hundred years to reach that which was most dear. Aidan wasnt sure why he had run into the squirrel or why the squirrel could talk, but he was thrilled to finally be using his skill as a digger.It never occurred to him as he set about digging that there might be a reward for him at the end of fulfilling the squirrels request. Pure of heart, Aidan simply felt akin to his fellow creature, happy to be of service.I think Ive found something, Aidan said, as his spade hit something under The World Tree. Its metal.Oh, that is indeed the serpents lair. Dont knock on it yet, as I need to retrieve the terrible things of the world, Drill-tooth sighed.I can get them for you, Aidan suggested.The squirrel gave a long look, appraising the young boy.The terrible things of the world are at the top of this tree, he said. The World Tree is high, its branches are crooked, and the eagle jealousy keeps them in his possession. Do you think you can climb this tree, where the east winds will blow and the eagle may peck your hands?You said you needed my help, so I will try my best.Thank you, Aidan, said the squirrel. But do not look into the terrible things of the world. You must promise.I promise, Aidan said, meaning it with his whole heart. And with that, Aidan scurried up the tree, clinging limb to limb, as effortlessly as any squirrel.For a boy who had spent most of the last few years in bitter servitude, Aidan found the freedom of leaving the earth exhilarating. He was not the eagle and he could not fly, but he felt weightless just the same.Nearing the top of The World Tree, it occurred to Aidan that Drill-tooth had told him precious little about the terrible things of the world. He chuckled as he thought to himself that it must be his Aunt and Uncle waiting for him at the top of the tree. At the crest and with the ability to see more of the world than he ever thought possible, Aidan knew he couldnt have been more wrong.Neatly tied in brown burlap and laying in the eagles nest, the terrible things of the world seemed ready to be taken down to the serpent. As Aidan gripped the bag and prepared to descend, sharp talons suddenly appeared, followed by an ear-splitting cry.Aidan feinted just in time to avoid the eagles deadly claws and quickly ducked to avoid its sharp beak. His time with his Aunt and Uncle had trained his reflexes well. Come to think of it, digging in his Uncles fields made him strong and hearty, so much so that Aidans climbing The World Tree was as easy as talking to a squirrel.As the eagle screamed his disappointment and flew away, Aidan adroitly clamoured down the maze of limbs, down to the ground where his concerned friend waited.Did you look in the bag? Drill-tooth asked.You told me not to, Aidan said, puzzled.You are a good lad, the squirrel replied and took the bag. Its time to awaken the serpent. Are you ready?I am, said Aidan, with more courage than he felt. He remembered the ancient Greeks told the story of Pandora, a girl entrusted with a box which held all the terrible things of the world. But, this was just a myth, for all the evils of the world stem from one only source which currently resided in the burlap bag that Aidan held.Dont open the bag until it is time, the squirrel warned.I wont, Aidan replied, wondering how he would know when the right time was.What Aidan also didnt know was that Drill-tooth had been searching his whole life for the one who was selfless enough to be able to use the source to kill the snake. Aidan was the right boy and now was the right time.Take your spade and knock it loudly against the serpents door, Drill-tooth ordered.Aidan did as he was asked.Louder! the squirrel instructed.Aidan used all his might and made a noisy clamor as metal spade hit metal door.Who disturbs the serpents rest? came a very old voice. A very big reptile slowly slithered through the metal door. The serpent was twice as thick and three times as long as Aidan, who stood shaking, holding the small burlap bag.I am Aidan. I have the terrible things of the world for the serpent under the root of The World Tree.Yes, the serpent hissed. I see you, Aidan of the Wood. What is in your small bag?I do not know. Drill-tooth told me not to look.Drill-tooth? You mean Ratatoskr, the serpent explained. We are old friends. Look in the bag.Drill-tooth told me not to look, Aidan said firmly.Look in the bag, demanded the serpent.I will not, Aidan replied.The serpent coiled around Aidan, squeezing his ribs harder and harder.Resisting with all of his strength and with the knowledge of the importance of his quest, Aidan freed himself from the grasp of the serpent.It was at that precise moment he understood why he was chosen to defeat the serpent and rid the world of its terrible things. He instantly realized he was guilty of ingratitude. It was the hard life imposed on him that gave him the skill to dig, the dexterity to climb, and the strength to free himself from the serpent.At that thought, he was flooded with gratitude, not for his mistreatment, but for the opportunity of becoming better and stronger as a result. Aidan thought how ingratitude comprised all the terrible things of the world, as all of them could be remedied by a grateful heart.Drill-tooth smiled, as only squirrels can smile, knowing instinctively Aidan was now not only pure of heart, but also now sound of mind and calm of spirit.Open the bag now! the squirrel shouted. Open the bag, but avert your eyes!Aidan closed his eyes tightly, opening the bag as the squirrel directed. A cold rush of east wind howled, as a chaotic whirlwind ascended from the deepest recesses of the burlap bag, writhing and screaming as it went.Soon, Aidan fell to the ground, struggling to catch his breath.Open your eyes now, Drill-tooth said, in a too familiar voice. To Aidans wonder and amazement, the World Tree, the eagle, and the serpent were all gone.Even Drill-tooth was gone. In his place stood his long lost father and mother.There were so many questions flooding Aidans mind, but they were all lost in his desire to hug his parents and to know they were real. The tears that streamed down his mothers face onto his shoulders and the strong embrace of his father was all the proof he needed.While still in his parents arms, Aidan looked to the wood and whispered his thanks, for the experience of the terrible things of the world and the joy for the most wonderful.Aidan never saw Drill-tooth again, and he never again spoke with any other woodland creatures. But the lessons he learned from his short friendship were not lost on him.And the story ""Aidan in the Wood"" was told and retold from generation to generation around fires and at family gatherings, especially by mothers and fathers who gratefully tucked much beloved children into their warm beds."
Lucky's Hibernation,"Lucky woke up with a yawn already forming. She stumbled out of bed and down the stairs to her kitchen, where she found her dogs asleep by the fireplace. It was spring, they should be waking up anytime now.	Lucky had been accustomed to missing winter for four years, a habit she had picked up when she accidentally got into a fight with a girl who had been bullying her best friend. The bully had a fairy godmother as it seemed, and Lucky had been punished.	Her favorite season was the winter. It was cold, it was snowy, blissful, and it felt so right. But when she punched that girl in the face and broke her nose, she lost that.	You see, the girl did have a fairy godmother. Except, she was her real mother, and she happened to be a sorceress. The mother cursed Lucky to sleep through her favorite season- odd curse, I know- because the mother wanted Lucky to miss big parts of the year.	When she started nodding off in class at the first sign of snow, she had been dragged to every hospital her mother could find. Nobody knew what was wrong. Nobody but Lucky.	Every year since she had missed Christmas and the first snowfall and every memory shell never be able to make. She got her own house and got pet dogs, and they began to pick up her habits of sleep as well.	Lucky called her mother, something she did every time she woke up after months, and they talked for hours. Lucky tried to explain to her mother, again, why she had to sleep through the winter, but she didnt believe her. Really, who would? But was her mom the one who should have kept an open mind?	Or was it Lucky?	Lucky had always thought she would just live like this because of something she did when she was younger, but deep down she knew that wasn't the full truth. But, what was?	Lucky and her mother talked and cried and as Lucky was about to say her goodbyes, her mother stopped her.	Darling, there is something you need to know. Her mother began.	Lucky knew her mom, knew she didnt need an invitation to continue, so she waited patiently on the other end of the line as her mother sighed.	You think you know why you sleep through the winter, but you dont. Its not because you stood up for your friend, or because some bullys mom was a sorceress- thats all just some hoopla I put in your mind. The truth is, youve been like this since you were a little baby.	You know why your nickname is Lucky? Because its lucky you survived. We went camping and your dad took you somewhere to see the overview, the pretty sunset, but he didnt know there were baby bears nearby. He didnt hear the mama bear coming back. He turned to take you back, and there he was faced with the bear. He ran by to get to me, he didnt notice that the bear had clawed off the pack you were being carried in. When he noticed, his face went pale and his eyes became wide and frantic. He ran back, desperate to find you, and he noticed the bear staring at you. Its head was tilted. A bear cub came out and snuggled with you, and the only damage he could see on you were a few scratches from where the pack had been ripped. He didnt want to leave you in danger, so he came forward slowly. He leaned down, but as soon as he touched you, the bear snarled. The baby bear was right there. So he slowly backed up, waiting. He waited until night, thinking the bears would leave you out there, but they took you with them into their den.	When night fell, your dad crept into the den carefully, he couldnt see a thing. He actually carefully picked up a baby bear first, mistaking its fur for your pack, but quickly corrected his mistake. When he finally got back to camp, he looked rugged, tired, and worn down. So we cut the camping trip short and took you home. But that year, you slept through the whole winter. We were worried, but the doctors said nothing of it. So we ignored it and spent the rest of the year together. But the next winter, you did the same thing. So, we went to the hospital after hospital but could figure out anything. Finally, your smart papa connected it to the bear. It must have been magic or something.	But thats the truth. Luckys mom finished.	Wow, Lucky said, Thats She almost kept her voice even before they both broke out into laughter. Her dad was an actor who hated camping, and her mom was the mayor. Neither of them wanted to nor had time to see nature. Plus, they both knew the actual reason Lucky slept through winter.	It wasnt because of some magic mother or magic bear.	Lucky slept through winter because she simply felt like it.	Sure, she loved winter, but her job required late nights, and she figured out a system. Tell everyone a story that could be believable in this magical world, never sleep the rest of the seasons, and hibernate through the summer. It worked.	Luckys bosses were kind and everyone knew she was the hardest worker, so they humored her. Even though they also knew the story was a ruse, and Lucky would be better off and much healthier if she just did her work a normal amount, slept a normal amount, and didnt miss her favorite season. She would be happier.	But Lucky was stubborn, and nobody was going to tell her what to do. So she told her stories and worked her system until her body nearly broke, and then she slept. And slept. And she slept for days, months, and when she woke up she was refreshed. But it didnt last long, it never did. Had she been less stubborn and listened to others, she would have. Well, not had to hibernate. Not had to miss showers for months or get yellow teeth from lack of brushing, or wake up nearly famished to death. So lets be honest, did her system really work?"
The Ugly Flower,"Not because you named your child after a flower already meant she would be as delicate, pretty, and as fragrant as the flower she was named after. It could be otherwise.Jinta would be seen every day in front of her flower shop. Her face would be a frown, her rich dark eyebrows a V-shape above her huge crooked nose. She was a strange sight amidst the beautiful flowers surrounding her. Toddlers would cry when they see her. Bigger kids would shoot her with pellet guns from behind and run away when she looks back at them with an angry face. Women will throw her looks of discernment whenever she walks by, and men would turn their backs in disgust.Nevertheless, her flower shop is a success, and people from different towns come over to buy her flowers. A lot of people attempted to open their own flower shops, but all went in vain.'We must know her secret,' said one neighbor who loves to bath herself in powdery perfumes.'She must be a witch or a shaman for all I know!' said one who tried to open her own flower shop but failed. 'She must have cursed my shop.''I heard she is a blessing and a curse,' said another one with rollers on her hair as she chewed cherry gums that tainted her lips.'Tell us about it,' said Mrs. Powder Scent. She and Mrs. Flower Shop Fail leaned closer to Mrs. Hair Rollers.She was named after the flower Hyacinth because when her mother, Katherine, died upon giving birth to her, a pink Hyacinth bloomed in her garden for the first time ever. Jacinta is a Spanish translation of Hyacinth, although none of her parents had any Spanish roots. As she grew up, the neighbors called her Jinta as supposed to Jacinta that was supposed to be a pretty, delicate flower. And she's quite the opposite.Jinta's mother loved flowers, but she didn't have a green thumb. She always envied all her neighbors' gardens every spring when their gardens are in full bloom.'Why can't I grow flowers?' she would say in despair. Whatever she planted either died or survived but never produced any flowers.Her father, Daniel, thought that her daughter was what Katherine's plants were waiting for (only if plants really knew how to wait), assuming that all of those were a miracle instead of a mere coincidence. When he brought the infant Jacinta home, the garden was in full bloom; he was in tears. He started cultivating the flowers, and their garden was the most beautiful in the neighborhood.'And what d'ya think is her secret? Why is her flower shop a success?' asked Mrs. Flower Shop Fail.'We need to find out,' said Mrs. Rollers, who still kept chewing her cherry gum.The three Mmes paid poor Tomas, a homeless boy, to spy on Jinta.'This money is enough to get you by for a week,' said Mrs. Rollers.Tomas swallowed in fear as he accepted the money.One afternoon, he followed Jinta on her way home.Jinta went straight to her garden and started singing. Her voice was like church bells, and the flowers swayed with her rhythm.The butterflies followed her and the birds and the bees seemed to hum with her. The whole garden seemed so bright and sparkling with magic clouds of dust. It seems that everything she touches comes to life. All the while, Tomas was watching this spectacle behind a bush. He was hardly breathing so as not to get any attention.Jinta looked at the bush and walked towards it.Closer. And closer. Sweat dripped from his forehead. He must not be found. Little did he know that no matter where he hides, she will find him, for she is one with all the plants in her garden.Jinta peeped into the bush. 'Hello there, little Tomas.'He was surprised. Jinta's voice is like an angel and nobody heard her voice ever. He imagined that her voice must be creaky like a witch but it was otherwise.'Come out,' she said with her gap-toothed smile.""I'm sorry,' Tomas said.'Why are you sorry?''They asked me to follow you to know your secret.''My secret?' she asked, surprised.'Yeah, they said I need to know why your flower shop is successful. And I need to tell them. They paid me to do this.'Jinta smiled. She opened the door to the house and motioned her hands for Tomas to get in. They headed straight into the kitchen and asked Tomas to sit in the dining. She served him fresh strawberries and a glass of milk. He devoured the sweetest strawberries he ever tasted in his life.She placed her elbows on the table, her palms on each side of her cheeks.'There's no such secret, Tomas,' she said smiling. 'You only need to pour your heart into what you do.'Tomas was looking at her with a mouth filled with strawberries.'Would you like to stay for dinner?' she asked.Poor Tomas, who didn't have proper meals for a week, didn't hesitate to say yes to the invitation.While Jinta was preparing their dinner, Tomas wandered about the living area and saw a pile of books on the shelf. He picked one and brought it to her.'Missus, d'ya think you can lend'is to me?'She smiled. 'Of course.'Tomas was jumping with excitement and started reading the book until dinner was served.'How d'ya call this missus?''That's Chicken Pot Pie. Do you like it?'He nodded with his cheeks full of food.After his sumptuous dinner, Tomas bid Jinta goodbye and walked home.The next day, Tomas went to the three Misses and told them what happened to his mission. They all listened in shock. They could not believe a thing that Tomas said.'Bring us there, ' said Mrs. Rollers.Tomas walked the same path as when he followed Jinta. When they reached the place, there was no house or gardenjust an empty lot with tall weeds.'You gotta be kidding us!' said the angry Mrs. Rollers.'Tell us the truth!' said Mrs. Flower Shop Fail. 'Did she pay you more than we did? We can double the price. Just tell us where it is.''No ma'am,' said Tomas nervously, looking to his left and right to ensure that he was in the correct location. 'I'm sure this is the place.'The three Mmes looked at Tomas in disdain and asked him to go with them to Jinta's flower shop.To their surprise, Jinta was not there. A man in his late forties was sitting in the middle of all the flowers.'How can I help the ladies and the young mister?' He said with a genuine smile.'Where is Jinta?' Mrs. Rollers said.'Who?' asked the gentleman.'Where is she, the ugly flower seller?' asked Mrs. Powdery Scent.'What do you mean?' asked the confused gentleman. 'I've been the flower seller here for decades.The three Mmes and poor Tomas were all confused. Tomas told the gentleman the whole story.And finally, the gentleman asked Tomas, 'what is the title of the book?''Enchanted Garden.'"
The Orisun Omi Forest,"The Orisun Omi ForestBy Lavonya Ogunwale It was early one morning in March. Just before daybreak, all the creatures of the Orisun omi (Spring) Forest were gathering at the center of the forest. It was definitely a morning like not many in Orisun. You could hear the pitter-patter of little hoof and paw scampering from near and far. Every creature was dragging and pulling one of their own kind in a rush to hear the voice of the great, Elder Evergreen! Every year this was the greatest event of the Orisun Forrest. They had all gathered together to hear the announcement of the coming of spring. It was always a feast of friendship whenever the animals of the forest would gather together. The laughter as the day begins to come alive. The bunnies playing along with the young squirrel. The young doe prancing about trying to get in step with the other youngsters. Everyone was excited and in a state of unrest. In past stories told near and far...It was a great honor to be in the presence of your Elder Evergreen. Each creature invited to the festivities of the day was tasked with the responsibility of being the courier to their kind for the coming of spring. It was a great honor because it was the only time of year that Elder Evergreen broke tradition and spoke to another outside his kind. The Evergreen had been around for a long time and so they spoke in an ancient tongue that only the Evergreen could understand. On this day the Evergreen would show his face and speak in a language that every creature could understand. Every year, in late winter the word will start to spread abroad The awakening of the Evergreen! As the animals of their forest were making their way, Elder Thumper, one of the elder rabbits, started to complain loudly, Every year, creatures of every kind would show up. The rabbits and foxes are here. The turtles and the bears are here. The only ones who never showed up would be those lousy garden plants and flowers. Then grumpy old Thumper folded and gave a loud sigh. Ahhh! Just then, one of the younger rabbits snarled back, Yeah, and someone always has to be responsible for taking the news back to them. Who do they think they are? No one said another word in response. Meanwhile, in the far east of the Orisun omi, there was a clearing in the woods, just below the grounds surface lived five sisters. Baptista, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Choral Bell, and the most prettiest of all, the youngest sister, Asters. That same morning far away the flower sisters were all snuggled comfortably in their beds. Peony was next to the eldest and the first to awaken. She let out a loud yawn and then a sigh. Then little miss Peony rubbed her little eyes and threw her feet off the side of the bed. Peony immediately began to smile when she noticed the bright rays of the sun peeping through the small holes in the ground that the sisters used for windows. Peony was snuggled tightly in her winter gown. It was the softest color of pink but it was just right for keeping her warm during the winter months. Peony was soft just like the color of her gown. She was the quietest and most timid of all the sisters. Quietly Peony tip-toed into Baptistas room and sat down softly on her bed. Baptista wake up! Peony whispered in her excited whisper voice. The sun is shining and I can feel the warmth beating throw the surface of the dirt. Baptista rolled over and smiled with her eyes still shut. She grabbed her little sister by the hand and sat straight up and whispered back, Cant you just smell the rain already. Baptista was tall and skinny. She also was adorned in her winter gown. She wore royal purple and a color that just made you want to smile. One by one the sister began to awaken each one reminiscing on their favorite characteristic of spring. Right in the middle of their awakening...the youngest of them, all yelled out with joy,  I want to be the first one on the surface this year. She immediately ran for her room and started dressing in her springtime dress. Aster put on her white spring gown. It had the brightest, most-beautiful, yellow bow it tied right in the center of her gown. She could barely keep still as the other sister reached and grabbed at her trying to get her ready to meet Orisun omi. They twisted and turned her until she was more beautiful than before and then they all smiled with a look of satisfaction. Peony whispered, Now youre ready! As soon as Aster reached the surface she could hear the bees buzzing and the birds chirping. She didnt look back as she emerged from the deep. She just out-stretched her arms and absorbed the sun as she had never before seen it. One by one the flower sisters started to surface and take their rightful place. Soon all of the sisters had surfaced and together. They were all standing in the sunlight, with their arms outstretched, making the most beautiful garden one had ever seen. Back at the center of the Orisun omi forest, all the animals had gathered and the Elder Evergreen had made his grand entrance. He greeted and graced the crowd. He and all the evergreens of the forest began to sway and bow as the Elder Evergreen began to speak. Greeting creature of the Orisun omi, I am the eldest of the Grand evergreens, said Elder. As he began to speak all of the creatures began to get quiet. All the laughter and scurrying about had now ceased. It was so quiet you could almost hear the leaves growing. As you all know us Evergreen has been around since the beginning of time. Year after year we brave the weather and season changes. We never sleep nor slumber. Weve seen the creation of the Orisun come with the season and weve seen them go! Weve witnessed the evolution of our world I am grateful to have you all come and join us for the days festivities. This day is the most important day of the year. As you all know there is nothing new under the sun and a season for everything. Without further ado, I am proud to announce that the season of new life has finally arrived. All of a sudden the animals, insects, birds, and the trees began to cheer. They all joined hands and began to sing Spring is here, spring is here. Ask me how I know. The birds are singing, bells are ringing and flowers are starting to grow. The Elder Evergreen was so elated to see the creatures of the Orisun omi come together and have such a grand time. Just as the dancing and the singing were coming to an end, the evergreen began saying their goodbyes until next year to come. Elder Thumper manages to corner the Elder Evergreen. Excuse me Grand Evergreen Excuse me! yelled Thumper trying to be heard over the crowd and laughter. First, let me say I am honored to be here, sir. I have been back here year after year and never made your acquaintance. Sir, sir, may I ask you a question, sir? Elder Evergreen was making his leave but he stopped to give Thumper the attention he seeked. He then responded by saying, My pleasure, Elder Thumper. The Elder was a wise old tree. He then stood there in silence and waited to see the nature of the call of Elder Thumper. Elder Thumper didnt want to appear to be too pretentious he stammered around his word before coming to the point. Why is it every year all the creatures, animals, and flowers alike show up to the awakening of the evergreen. The forest goes up every year! Everyone having the time of their life and those darned garden flowers are never around. The Elder evergreen stood in silence. It was as if he were giving Thumper time to get all his thoughts out before thinking of a suitable answer. Elder Thumper, I did notice that they never show up. When you return home dont you carry the new of the Orisun? Thumper began to rub his feet together as if he were nervous. I-i-i-i mean, I used to. We all used to. That is before they got too good. I mean I just don't understand why we should have too! By then a small crowd began to gather around the elders! Elder Evergreen in his infinite wisdom addressed the crowd again. Fellow Orisun Omi creatures, from this day forward, no one is responsible for bringing the springtime news to the flowers. After Evergreen had the attention of the crowd he proceeded to tell the citizens of the forest the signs of springtime. He talked about the rain. He talked about the birds coming back, chirping and making their nest. He talked about the new litter coming in and the animals coming out of hibernation. Then...he got to the point of the flowers. Im sure you all noticed that every year the flowers arent in attendance. The flowers are an important part of who we are. Here in the Orisun omi, flowers help to feed the bird and the bees. They provide the animals and the humans with medicines to help aid in their wellbeing. They help to fortify their own and on the darkest day, they make the world seem bright. They never come but are always there when we need them. One of the signs of the time is the flowers blooming. So, you see you never had to return the news of Springs arrival. They are the sign. exclaimed the Elder Evergreen. Thumper's cheeks turned a dark shade of Easter pink, he was so embarrassed. At first the crowd sat in silence holding onto every word of the Elder Evergreen. Then they broke out in another cheer, flowers make you happy, flowers make you sing. Flowers are pretty important especially in the spring! Year after year the creature flocked to the center of the Orisun, spending all their time being mad at the flowers for not showing up for the awakening of the Evergreen. Now the creature understands that the flowers are signs that defined the akoko orisun omi (Springtime) in the Orisun omi forest."
Towards the Burning Sphere,"That was my honest answer to its question.  Yawning my thoughts out, I opened my eyes and saw how bright the forest today. I quickly bent my upper body upwards and jumped out of Mister C. Gigantifolia's huge leaf. I am not a human but I have a God-given body like a human. I don't have a name when I was brought to the Earth but my fellow earthlings call me by Spring. And when I said 'my fellow earthlings', I mean the endangered creatures inhabiting the small area of the Earth, where the green dancers are tall, colorful flowers are blooming, and the heat of the sun is alive as the winter season passed by. ""Good morning, everyone!"" I greeted and lifted my head when a peeking ray of the sun hit my face and made me look at the swaying trees above me, ""Sway it, green dancers!"" I am the guardian of nature's life and I am gifted and these gifts mustn't be abused. ""Good morning, Spring!"" they greeted back harmoniously at me that made my cheeks bulged out from happiness. I was given a gift of communication, I can talk with the woodland creatures and understand them. My other gift is my wings, I can fly above the skies and look at the entire form of Earth. The last and greatest gift, I am invisible to humans' senses so that they can't harm me. I looked around the forest and saw the blossomed flowers, healthy animals, strong trees, and aliveness of the other creatures living with me in the forest.  I whispered inside my mind. Their life is my happiness. And whenever I am happy because of these creatures, I remember the only creature who makes my face frown. They said it is silent but still alive as it brings light to the world. ""Good morning, Sun! Did Moon angered you?"" I joked and let out a faint giggle. The usual answer  silence. It was only silence, a long and agonizing silence, while the wind kept blowing across my ears and touching my naked skin. ""Just let her shine, Spring,"" Floreta advised in her tiny voice. ""I know Floreta but..."" I crouched and crossed my arms on top of my knees then buried my chin on top of my left wrist, I sighed before continuing, ""It's been a hundred silent years, no words... how can I protect all of you if Sun won't talk to me anymore?"" ""Protect us from what, missy?"" Passiflora whispered. My heavy eyelids dropped and my smile vanished as I mention their name, ""Humans."" ""Oh, dewdrop, you are always protecting us,"" Passiflora reminded. ""But it is not enough. When I flew above the sky, all I see is them! Shaving half of the forest, burning innocent creatures, and ruling the world as if they own it!"" ""Calm down, Spring..."" Floreta told me. ""Humans are bound to be our greatest enemies, we can't alter that..."" Kapok tree expressed in a thick and low voice. ""But not all of them, Mister Kapok..."" Yellow Orchid, with her gentle attitude, opposed Kapok's bitter statement. ""Hmmm... Just like how the summer season is destined to come after this spring season and then winter will be back again..."" Miss Brocket joined in the conversation. ""Until we will blossom on spring season... again and again..."" Passiflora added. ""It's stinging my heart, seeing the Earth that was once green and full of nature's life will soon disperse from my sight."" ""We won't disperse, Spring, humans still need us..."" Floreta countered. ""And we need humans!"" Yellow Orchid exclaimed which made me smile for a while. ""See, we are not scared if our life will soon be taken because if it's fated to be then ready we must be."" Every creature agreed to Passiflora's statement and whispered their brave spirits. ""When you took your first steps on Earth, you are fated to be our guardian but you are not a wizard, Spring. You can't magic our fates and your fate."" I laid my back upon the dirt and placed my right hand beneath my head. If only I can find a way to connect to the Sun again. I raised my left hand and tried to reach for the sun while staring straight at it. If only I could reach you again and you can tell me what I must do... ""I know what to do! I will fly and talk to the Sun again."" ""You can't fly that high, Spring."" ""It's too dangerous."" They contradicted and voice out their opposition. ""Please, I must try..."" All of them left me with silence as their answer. I flapped my wings and it slowly lifted my feet away from the ground. ""This is our last hope..."" I whispered and flew away from the forest. Dashing through the sky, breaking the wind's current as I tried to get out of the Earth's atmosphere. I haven't tried this but don't know what could go wrong. I slowed down to avoid burning my wings and tried to adjust my movements. ""Sun..."" I whispered when I saw the burning sphere. I went near Venus and tried to talk to the Sun. ""Sun? Are you there?"" I asked and waited for an answer. But all I heard is an indistinct and faint voice, it was almost as faint as the wind on Earth. I went near Mercury and felt the warmth of the Sun. ""Do you still remember me? I am the guardian of nature's life on Earth and I need to know what I must do to protect them.""  ""I'm sorry, I can't hear you, Sun...""  When I finally heard it, it made me ask, ""Why?""  ""They did this to Earth, why would I look at them?"" I exclaimed with pure hatred. No answer. The Sun is silent again. I took the Sun's advice and went back to the Earth. I flew down to the skies and I leveled my gaze to a newborn human.  The Sun's words repeated inside my head. ""A seed and a flower,"" I whispered. I stood in front of a man talking to a black rectangular shape creature, they call it a cellphone. I leveled my gaze to his and saw a huge tree with growing fruits. An elderly woman walked past me and I followed her, trying to level my gaze upon her weak eyes. I saw a leafless tree. ""What does this mean, Sun?""  ""I don't believe they will, Sun... I have observed them... Cruel --""  I waited for the Sun to continue and watched as these humans walk around the solid surface.  I closed my eyes and whispered to the wind, ""Humans, you must fly down from the skies, level your gazes with them... and tell me what you can see in their eyes.""    I saw a flying leaf and petals that whirled above my head. I followed where it came from and saw the half of my body turning into petals and leaves. ""I am scared. What if...""  ""I do,"" the wind carried my dispersing body and whispered my last words, ""Fly down from your sky, level your gaze with each other..."" I looked up and all that is left to me is my left eye letting out one tear. ""...And tell me what you can see in their eyes..."""
5 years,"levtashionKatie, come to the office you are getting signed out. That was the last thing I heard before my life had changed forever!I waitedin the car while my mom was screaming on the phone about a lake house in some kinda woods, I think. It was winter and 10 degrees so I hoped we weren't going there. Finally, my mom got in the car and she didn't say anything. I asked her where we were going and she said don't worry about it. At this point I was a little bit scared, like is my mom a criminal or something. An hour went by and we were in the woods where I have never been and there was a house. One house In the middle of the woods is strange. Is this what my mom was talking about on the phone? The next thing I know my mom is getting out of the car while telling me to stay here and to stay put. 10 minutes pass and my mom is still in the house. I was on my phone texting my friend Lucy. I tell her everything. Then finally my mom comes out of the house and says. To unpack my stuff, and that my room is upstairs to the left. I was confused because I didn'tpack anything, but then my mom added  go look in the trunk. So then I knew she had packed some of my things. About 3 hours later my mom had me come to the living room. When I got there she had this worried look on her face. I thought it was something about my dad, he went missing 6 years ago. Then she said something WAY different. I was shocked about what she said and I was also confused. My mom had told me I was going to have powers! She said that on my 11th birthday which was on march 9th. Of course, I didn'tbelieve her. I was in shock. So later that night I wasin my room thinking about what my mom had said. I remember I was thinking about how my birthday was in 2 days and maybe I could have powers, but then I was like there's no way I could have powers. So the next day I avoided my mom until dinner. I asked her a bunch of questions like mom were you telling the truth yesterday. then she said she was 100% telling the truth. At dinner my mom talked to me about being homeschooled and how she is going to sell our house. Those 2 things made me very mad because I would never see my house again, but then she said we would go get our stuff tomorrow. I was so mad at her because she took everything from me. The next day was my birthday, I was going to see if what my mom had said was true. For breakfast my mom had made me french toast! She told me to go outside and play so I did but I was bummed out because Lucy didn't come to my birthday. About 2 hours of me playing outside, my mom came out and told me to follow her so I did. She took me to this lake and told me my power was levtashion. I was shocked at what she said because she had a serious face. An hour later I started to feel kinda sick. I told my mom and she said the time has finally come. She also said the feeling sick was a symptom of getting your powers. 20 minutes later I was puking in the toilet and then I yelled at my mom to get out of the bathroom and she wouldn't so I yelled again and then something went up in the air (shampoo bottle). My mom told me to keep yelling at her so I did and basically everything went up in the air! My mom was so exceeded,it was dinner time so I got up to go eat dinner and all the things fell on the floor. We had someburgers and fries. 4 months go by and i have my powers undercut on and then one night my mom said she had saved our house and that we were moving back in so then 2 days later we started to get packing and then she told me that all girls that are 11 have powers and if they tell any boy they will die.  2 weeks later we were all moved in and I was hanging out with lucy, her power was Elvis's belly and we played hide and seek a lot. When I and Lucy got older (22) we were still friends and we hung out a lot. We worked in the same job we had an apartment. My mom and I went speaking because she tried to take my power and my dad was found and I was so happy and everything was so great to untell lucy created souside! sgould i do more btw dont mind the restt     jhvgjchjbkjkjkjkrblevtashionKatie, come to the office you are getting signed out.

Faens True Purpose,"In a beautiful glade, deep within the forest of Midenearth, lives a race of wood elves. The wood elves are a graceful people, some very tall about six feet in height, and of fair hair, with long pointed ears. They have keen eye sight and hearing. Their reflexes are swift, and can be soft footed, so as not to alert those they walk near. Elves make wonderful hunters, gatherers, herbalists, and healers. They love all creatures of the forests, and have deep respect for nature. It is their way to use all parts of an animal in the hunt, to provide for the rest of city.      On a particularly sunny day, a child who is ninty-nine years, leaves the city. Her name is Faen. Another year and she will be an adult. She wears the cloak her mother has given her. It is special. It has magical embroidery for protection. Her bow, and quiver full of arrows are slung upon her back. Her dirty blond hair is tied up in braids with jewels and spider silk. She is wearing some leather armor, and a bold look of determination. The king has given her a quest. She must get a message to Moonsong in three days.     Faen, although only a child, is trusted with this message as she is the fastest elf in City Ravenlore. The elf tried to get her family to talk the king out of using Faen, but he insisted, as it was the utmost urgency. She had just enough lembas bread to get to the Moonsong. She also had just enough timber for two campfires. A glass bottle of endless water lies in her bag of holding. The bag is tied at her waste. The kings mage has cast a spell on it to make it light as a feather for her, so that it will not be weighed down. Faen, is not strong as others to bare the weight of the sack. There is no fanfare today for her farewell.     Taking the trail through the Starcrest Forest, Faen travels light footed. She knows that she would get farther, faster, by horse, but the king insisted that she do this by foot, so that there be less noise. Faen can hear her heart beating in her ears. She takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Birdsong is close by. Her feet fall softly on the trail. Leaves rustle down from the tree topped canopy. She is making good time heading northeast. The sun is beginning to move lower in the sky. She stops by a creek, pulls out the bread and water, and refreshes herself for just a moment. After taking in a deep breath, and soaking her feet in the cold water of the creek, she puts her feet back into her boots, and begins up the trail again.Before the sun can set, she finds a patch of grass off the trail where she can set camp. Expertly, she lights the fire with the kindling. It blazes to life. The sparks fly up to the tree tops. She takes a bedroll and lays it by the fire. The crackle of it reminds her of her own fireplace, and makes her thankful, and more at ease. She says a prayer of incantation, and asks for a blessing of protection from her deity Mielikki the Forest Queen. Faen walks in a circle and draws the shape of a unicorn head, the holy symbol of mielikki around her camp. Immediately, the circle becomes a dome of illusion so that trespassers will not see anything inside the dome. After another bite of bread, sleep comes, and then the dreams.     Faen, wakes with the sun, she is filled with a sense of foreboding. She remembers having dreams, but cannot recall what they were, but knows they were not good. She packs up camp, and leaves no sign of her trace. The second day on the path, she feels like someone is watching her. The hair on the back of her neck rises as she gets to the bridge at the waterfall.      There, on the opposite side is a goblin, sitting in a bombing tank, with his aim true and ready, for Faen. She felt something coming, but she could have never predicted this. The goblin exits his tank.His small body is scarred. His long green ears are full of earrings. He wears heavy combat armor. He has metal in his teeth. He stands on top of the tank. Then he spits.     I cant let ya pass, he looks back towards the direction behind the tank Ill offer ya a deal. Turn around now, and I wont draw me tank on ya, and have me dogs clean up, or stay, and Ill smatter ya off this here bridge. He looks Faen up and down. Either way you arent getting through.     The elf is scared, that much is true, but her people have gone up against goblins before. This time it was her against a goblin and a tank. She knows her arrows are no match against a tank. Just as she is about to turn around and make a new route north, around the goblin camp, a hawk flies against the sun, and into her field of vision.     'Ill cover you.' she hears a voice coming from the bird.     'I thank you.' Faen thinks.     'Once I make my move, you will run across the bridge, and hide in the first building on the left side. Ive already scouted it and it is empty. Caw-aw.' She hears the voice echo in her head. Its strange. She hasnt heard it before.     She looks down at her unicorn talisman. It is glowing bright white. The glow! It must be coming from Our Lady of the Forest! Faen shouts at the beady eyed creature. I will pass. Get in your machine.     At that, the goblin shuts the large metal door at the top with a thud, and climbs inside. A cacophonous screeching starts as twelve large birds come from the forest and bomb the window of the tank with berries, bugs, and bird excrement. The goblin cannot see. They begin beating their wings at the side of the tank creating further confusion for the goblin.     The slender elf bolts across the bridge at first glance of the distraction. She carefully makes her way into the first building. There, she sees a small rabbit. She remembers that the bird said this building would be empty. The building is small, and she has to crouch to fit inside. Perhaps the rabbit mistook it for a burrow. Goblin homes are small huts.     Please dont run and give me away, or squeal, she whispers to the rabbit.     Why would I do that? the rabbit replied. Im supposed to be their meal. May I come with you?     Faen takes the rabbit by the scruff of the neck and places him inside her leather armor so that his nose, eyes, and ears stick out in her bosom. He is very soft. You dont know how to get out of here do you? she asks.     Yes, The rabbit tells Faen how to sneak back out and find the main trail further away from the goblin town. She makes note that she is going to dedicate herself to becoming an acolyte to Mielikki, and create a temple to her name, if she ever makes it back to City Ravenlore.     Just as she thinks she has created enough distance between herself and the goblin town, she hears a whistle of a goblin while it is sharpening a blade. She jumps back into the shadows, opposite the sound. She watches as the goblin with a pickaxe, rounds the corner. Thatll teach them to gamble with me. it mutters. As it turns, Faen has a good shot. She readies her bow.     'Dont do it.' she hears the rabbit speaking in her head. 'You are a good Elf. I know. He didnt do anything to you.'  She lets it down on the ground.     There now. Go on. You dont have to look. They were going to kill you.     'Remember the ways of the woods, child,' the rabbit looks at the elf with tears swimming in its eyes. His ears lay flat. 'Only for defense and to take what you need.'     'You are so right, Rabbit. Revenge and fear were being served up hot and angry tonight, yes? Dont worry little one. It will be fine. I will repeat what I did last night and still get to my destination in time. Thank you for helping me remember. Hey, I just learned animal speaking today. You were a part of that. Would you like to come home with me? You could live in the palace with the king. My parents and I live in a servants home. Id give you to him.'     'What need have I of a palace? This here is my home. The leaves are my pillow. The nuts are my sustenance. I have water at the falls. Sunlight fills my day, and starlight lights my nights. My days are spent with my family happily in my burrow. I will never forget you, sweet elf. You rescued me.' With that the rabbit hops away into the forest, the light glinting off his little tail.     Faen sighs. She does repeat the steps from the night before, being very careful to secure her camp. She wants to make sure no one notices that she is there. The next morning she gets up before dawn. She has no idea how much time she must make up for the delay from the prior day. She basically glides through the trail. The silver arches of Moonsong rise up on the horizon.      Spires of silver adorned with purple Amethyst, and yellow Citrine greet the relieved elf first. She feels worn and tired, not worthy of meeting with the Lord and Lady of the fine city in the woods. Butterflies circle about, and land on every foxglove along the path. Great banners hang over the entrance to the grand hall in purple in yellow with a crescent moon. Guards come out to greet Faen first.     You have traveled far. Come rest a moment, then, you may see the Lord and Lady of Moonsong. It is good to have you here Miss Faen. At the sound of her name, the jewels in Faens hair begin to sparkle. The guards take her to a courtyard where a pond, with long white Koi swim about, and fireflies flit overhead. Ivy grows along the border, and wisteria hangs in clumps. She sits on a bench. She breathes in the sweetness of the flowers. She closes her eyes. They are heavy.     After some time, Faen is escorted to the grand hall and introduced to the royal party. She makes a long bow before them. She produces a scroll. Faen clears her throat. She shuffles nervously and takes in the royal couple. They are both beautiful. Each are decked in velvet robes of eggplant purple with gold threading. A silver moon is applied on each robe in fine stitched detail. They each wear silvery gold crowns entwined with purple and yellow gemstones. Both are autumnal brown skin hued, with sunlit golden hair, and eyes of spring grass green.     If it please the court, I have an announcement from City Ravenlore.. she reads the scroll. She has not seen it until now. King Varis, of City Ravenlore, would like to invite all eligible elves to City Ravenlore for a woodland Ball in honor of his daughter Faen Ravenlore. It will be her one hundredth birthday, and it will be suitable for her to have a coming of age ball. The ball will take place in five days time. I expect all to be in attendance. Please also note that I regret that I had to ask Faen to make this journey, rather than one of my usual guards. It was her test. When she was but a baby, a curse was put on her by a Dwarven sorcerer. She would not be allowed to live in the palace in wear our family name until she made this pilgrimage alone. I have feared every day since she was born she would not make it to see this day and read these words to you, but if you are hearing them, I would say she has made it. Congratulations, Faen, my child, you have broken the curse, and may return as Princess Faen Ravenlore. King Varis.Tears well in Faens eyes. She curtsies now before the royal family of Moonsong.     I had no idea, she shakes her head in disbelief.     Well, how could you? Asks the queen.  Everyone around her smiles and laughs.      Faen is given a wonderfully large room to sleep in that night. The bed is oak, and she falls fast asleep lulled by waterfalls outside her window, the whistling of frogs and crickets.       Travel arrangements are made to escort Princess Faen from Moonsong by elven carriage complete with royal guards from the city court. Several carriages are forming an entourage. Faen cannot believe her turn of luck. Only yesterday she was just a hunter, winning hard earned meats and skins for City Ravenlore, and now she wonders if her father would forbid her from going out to hunt for her family and replace her skills. She feels sad at that thought.     As the wheels clack against stones and twigs on the path she takes a bite of bread and a sip of water. Sleep overcomes her. When she awakens, she is told that there is not much further left to go before she is home. The horse and carriage is much faster. She is surprised that she did not see the goblin camp on the way. They must have known another route. The journey remains uneventful.     Unlike her exit from the city, her entrance is very different. Horns begin blasting. Flags are marching down stars. Confetti and streamers are flowing in the air. Ravenlore looks beautiful. Red poppies and roses are in full bloom against the black cherry wood of the city. Bright red berry bushes line the path into the city. Dark wooden carved Ravens sit boldly by the entrance to the great hall.      When Faen exits her carriage, she is careful not to step on her cloak. The ground is muddy. Her family has come down to greet her. All is ceremonious. They bow down to those in the next carriages. It is good to be home Faen exchanges stories with her family as she makes her way back to her quarters, and the guards escort the others to their temporary lodgings. That night at dinner, she tells her brother, and her mother and father, all about what happened on her journey. She even tells them about the animal speaking.So, it is true, mother said. You are the Princess after all. When they handed you to me all those years ago, I vowed to raise you as my own. They said animal speaking was something only the royal line could do and it was something you would learn the year before becoming a grown man or a grown woman. Next thing I know you will be getting the wanderlust.     I think this is enough wanderlust. I want to become an acolyte for Mielikki. Im going to ask the king during my birthday party if I can oversee the building of a temple here to her in our capitol city. She saved me. She is the one who helped me in my journey to Moonsong and helped me learn my animal speaking. Faen brightened at the thought. Again, the medallion glowed around her neck.     I think it is a good idea, but we shall have to see what he thinks. I think he wishes you to marry. Do not get your hopes up yet.     On the night of Faens party, everything is going well. Harpists are playing, dancers and singers are performing. Faen pulls the king away into a small chamber to see if he will accommodate her wishes for the small temple to the Mielikki. She also asks him about her role in the palace. The king tells her he will allow the temple to go up and she can assist in the creation. He also tells her that it will be too dangerous for her to lead the hunting party as Princess, that someone else will take over. When she hears him tell her that he will forbid her to become acolyte as well as marry as the Princess, she storms out of the chamber.     Faen approaches a dark wooden lectern at the center of her party. She stops the music. She calls forth dozens of ravens with her mind. The all sit by her side. This day, I am a woman. This day, I am also relinquishing my title and my power as Princess. I had it for one day. I am building a temple to Our Lady of the Forest who saved me, and to whom I have sworn my service. Should you wish to honor someone. Honor not me, but honor her, for by her, we have all the bounty of the land upon which we live. I am still Faen. I am still the best hunter in Ravenlore. Thank you.She exits the stage. She walks to her mother, father and brother, where they wait for her. She smiles at them, and her whole being seems to radiate with this light green glow.     Lets just go home, and let them enjoy their party, while I start planning my Ladys temple."
"You, flower","I never really understood, why people lived so complicated lives. Why there were so many things going on in their little heads with billions of thoughts. So many options, so much freedom, still they complained about it with jealousy in their eyes and need to be someone else in their voices every time they spoke.	They would come to the park every day, or just every Friday, doing the same thing all over again. Sometimes I wondered, why they desperately wanted to be someone else all the time. Or why they talked bad about those, who were so different from them.	My whole life, I was studying them, trying to find out, what was going on. When one day, all of a sudden, just after the big shiny Moon on the night sky went away and an even bigger bright Sun showed me, that there was just green around me.	Not little violet flower like me. Just grass.	An hour went by and the park filled with people again, just as usual. But today, their faces werent so happy anymore, nor their eyes glittering while looking my way. Only this little girl stopped, the only person, that was not bored, and pointed her index finger at me.	A tiny smile appeared on her baby face.	Look mum, thats such a beautiful flower, she shouted, running towards me. In a second, an older woman stood next to her, nodding. Youre right, Melanie. And she leaned to me, picking me up.	The small wave of pain rushed through my body, and I felt the blood draining from the edge of my stem, making me cold.	Mum put me into the hands of her daughter, Melanie, and her big blue eyes admired me for a little. So pretty. Can I keep it? she questioned her mum, and after she nodded, she chucked beautifully, which made my leaves flutter lightly. I was happy for making her happy.	All three of us walked out of the park and out of nowhere, the air began to be havier and the Sun wasnt warming me anymore. I felt cold and scared. But that feeling quickly went away, after Melanie came up to other little creatures as her, showing me off.	Look at this pretty flower, she told kids around her proudly and in response, she received a wave of brightened faces. I must have blushed for being idolized like this. Most of the time, it was my violet friend.	Where did you find it? some boy asked Melanie, who kissed me softly. I saw that hint of jealousy in his eyes, but it complimented me. They praised me.	Melanie smiled, showing her uneven teeth. In the park. But there isnt any other like this one anymore. This is the last one. Kids frowned and began to back off, returning to their game.	Melanie sobbed. Hey! Where are you going? she asked furiously. I was wondering the same thing. What about me? They barely looked at me for a minute.	One of the guys turned to her. Its boring. Max has a car and he promised, we can drive it. He explained and his words hit me painfully. But not Melanie, she smiled, throwing me away, and ran after the other kids.	I fell down to the cold ground, not soft that I used to spend every day, but hard and not comfortable. And I realized that Melanie was just the same.	For the rest of my life, I laid on the road, trying not to cry after someone stepped on me, thinking about Melanie. Thinking about everyone.	I knew, that by the time, the Moon would appear in the sky, I would bleed out or dry. So I just cherished the last moment of it. Of my existence.	It was sad, how people looked at beautiful things with such admiration, but still, it hurt to see them get over it so quickly, after something different, bigger, and more amazing showed up.	How jealous they were and how much they fished to be the most popular, the most idolized ones, still, they acted all the same. And how could they adore someone the same as all of them? Just by what they had. And what the others didnt. By what they made them cooler than them.	It wasnt about personality. About what you liked and who you were. They just praised what the others praised. They wanted to be so popular and in reality, all they did, was lost themselves.	But, was it worthy?	My whole life, I was a flower. I lived my small life looking at them, studying them. And then, there was grass, all around me, still, everyone stopped, and just saw me. Not because I was cool. Not because I was the most beautiful flower. Not because I was flawless.	Just cuz of me.	And now, when I wasnt there. There was just grass. Boring grass, without the ability to make people smile.	So I laid there, just waiting for my end when suddenly someone picked me up and smiled. It was a person. Their face was not that perfect as Melanies was, and they had shaved head.	Hey, beautiful, they whispered and by a soft voice I could tell, it was a girl. Maybe.	A warm feeling filled me and I let the person took me with them. After few minutes, they put me into a glass in their apartment and when I looked around, I saw some other flower in the glass with me.	It was my violet friend.	Im Lizzy, she introduced herself to us. Her smile was wide and her lips were much redder than usual lips. And then I remembered. I had seen her before. She would come to the park every evening, just looking around and draw something in her little notebook.	She walked over to us with a paper and showed us her painting. It was me and violet.	I dont understand, who could teared you off. But dont worry, I wont let you die, she told us and I knew, she was one of us. She was the flower.	A person so unique and herself, then everyone looked at her no matter where she was. She was so original and herself, that instead of picking flowers, she would paint them and capture them forever.	Because true beauty wasnt the one, that lasted for a day, for a month or a year. It lasted forever. Therefore, there was nothing greater than true beauty.	Nothing greater, than being your true self."
The Tale of A Dancer and A Singer,"In front of the wooded fortress lies a sea of red roses that stretched over a mountain and ended before a forest. On every petal was a droplet that slowly moved its way to the center of the stigma. A blue butterfly with white spots lands in the center of the rose and collides with the droplet. Neither party was at war with each other nor served to nourish the roses. It flew away, knocks over old petals, and heads to the forest. As the sun shines over each rose, a wind emerges, lifting withered petals into the sky, and maintains attitude. The red petals moved in coherence with the winda cluster of red clouds spread like a sea of red flames throughout the field. The clouds floated long enough for a boy who lives in the forest and a girl trapped in the fortress to see it.The boy ran to the sea of red flames, stunned at its beauty and bewildered at nature's creation. He lifts his hands and turns his back, trying to catch one while revealing a scar on his left shoulder. The girl saw him as he extended his limbs to catch a petal and calls out, ""Dancer!"" He stops and sees a girl with black hair and a crescent birthmark on her hand. She opens her mouth and releases a medley. Each note served a purpose. It spoke to the Dancer's heart. It sung to the swaying roses. It caught the attention of the forest spirits, and it penetrated the fortress's walls. The Dancer moved to Singer's song. With every step he took, petals flew in every direction. Spinning, he leaps into the air and dances on the red cluster. The Singer was astonished by the boy that danced on flames. The Dancer was thrilled with their performance.As he declines back to the ground, he looks over to see her face. Instead of joy, he saw the Singer's startled look as four men clad in armor from head to toe took her toward the fortress.He runs after the armored men. No matter how hard he tries to close the distance, the gap stays the same. They run past the flowers into a field of dirt where the grass doesn't grow, and the seeds refuse to touch. All the plants stood a mile away from the fortress as if for caution. The Dancer noticed how distant the plants are and began to slow down little by little as he thought more about it. The thieves outran him and escaped behind the massive, wooded pillars. The boy stops in front of it because the spirits raised him and told him to ""never enter the fortress."" Heading back to the forest, he sits, looks at roses, and waits to see if the Singer will return. Clouds covered the sun and released a fury of droplets onto the field. The butterfly couldn't collect nectar with all the rain. Its wings were wet, making it unable to fly. The roses were overwhelmed and began to wither. As the butterfly crawled on the ground, it retreats to the forest so the rain wouldn't hurt it.""Lower the Gate,"" yield one of the soldiers as they pull the girl deeper into a town within the fortress a place with small homes, a merchant's market, people in tattered clothing, and a tent covering the entire area from the rain. The soldiers positioned themselves in front, on both sides, and behind the girl to prevent her from going anywhere and prevent her from putting anyone in danger. ""Take her to the Tess,"" cried a voice from the crowd. ""No, banish her,"" as one toss a piece of bread at her. The girl was afraid, not because of the consequences of her actions,of Tess. As the group pushed to their leader's home, one of the citizens tossed a withered small rose to the mud. Tess's fortress was not a place for flowers to grow.They entered a small gray house. A woman wearing a tattered red shirt, blue pants, glasses, and short hair was seated in front of the group. ""Tess, I'm sorry"" cried the girl. Tess interrupted the plead with a wave of her hand as a sign of silence. Suddenly, the soldier behind the girl fainted. The sight didn't faze Tess. Instead, she said, ""All of you go to the showers now.""After rinsing off the residue from the field, the girl returns to Tess. She chose to stand in case there was an opportunity to run. As the Singer waited for Tess to speak, she noticed a small butterfly flew into the room from a crack in the window. ""Do you know how foolish your actions were,"" yelled Tess. ""A man fainted because of you. If I would've let you return to the city without supervision, imagine the lives at risk"", as she slams her arm on the arm of her chair.The girl interrupts, ""I know, but there's just so much beauty out there""""There, the field of roses. The place where the spirits play and laugh at our limitations. Home to the yellow dust that claws our eyes, stuffs our noses, blocks our ears, and clogs our lungs. For some, it's a minor reaction. For others, it's life or death. This is why I built this place to protect those that can't go out there.""""But Tess it's cruel,"" said the Singer.Tess replies, ""Cruel! What's cruel about the fact that the air I breathe is both a gift and a curse. If you think that's villainous, then call me a villain. I, the person that made a home for people to live in. Me, the person that made a line between the plants and us. If I'm a villain for keeping nature out, then mother nature is a villain for creating it.""As tears begin to roll down the girl's cheek, she lowers her voice and says, ""it's not the flower's fault.""""Your right. It's not the flower's fault,"" Tess replies as she leans back into her chair and notices the butterfly. ""They're only a minor issue that's manageable. The real problem is the trees and grass that come along with it. If there was a way to negotiate with the spirits, then we wouldn't have a problem."" Before Tess finishes talking, she grabs a cloth from her pocket while studying the insect. ""But the spirits refuse because they need the pollen for the plants to grow,"" she said as she swats the bug with a cloth and tosses it in a bin. ""If the Dancer comes close to us again, he will be dealt with.""The next day, the butterfly returns to the field, flying around to find a suitable rose. The girl passes by the butterfly and stops in front of the forest. The Dancer walks towards her, ready to perform another duet. She stops him and says:""I can't. We're two completely different beings. You live with spirits, insects, and plants. I live with people. You dance, and I sing. You have all the time in the world as I cling onto the smallest grain of sand. No matter how hard I clench my hands together, the sand spills outleaving me with little time and many responsibilities. My actions being here with you puts my people in harm. There are things that I need to do, and I can't waste time spending it with you.""The Singer walks away and heads back to the fortress. He looks at a rose, saw the butterfly, and waited to see if it gets to the center. But the flower was drenched and couldn't stand straight, so it flew away.Spirits named Rhythm and Blues saw as the boy sluggishly walks away. They understood his sorrow, her worry and decided to help them. Rhythm called all the insects; Blues told them, ""when the flowers bloom dive into the pollen and fly towards the fortress. Tell the humans this will stop when the Singer meets the Dancer.""Both sides engaged in combat. Tess and her soldiers planted mixers jars with salt, sugar, and vinegarinto the soil to confuse the bugs. If some try to push past the first defense, the armored soldiers will intercept the bugs with torches in their hands. A honey few passed the first line of defense and engaged in combat with a soldier.The soldier brought the flame close to the bee to ward it off. Black smoke blocked the bee's vision, but it didn't stop it from flying around and stinging the soldier before leaving.Then, wasps and alates manage to make it to the second line of defense. The soldiers were now feeling the pressure. ""We need more fire,"" yelled a soldier as he swings the torch back and forth to ward off the wasps. Standing on top of the pillar, Tess screams, ""light the field!"" The air around the soldiers changed as each one chanted, ""light the field!"" One man with a barrel in hand ran from the town, through the gate, and to the battlefield. He ran behind the soldiers as they try to fend off the bugs, making sure to pure the oil from the barrel with every step he took. ""It's ready,"" the man yelled. All the soldiers rushed behind the line the man created. One of the soldiers dropped a torch into the oil, and a wall of flames stretched from the ground to clouds. The insects had no way to overcome flames. The fire blocked their way, and the smoke blocked their line of sight. But this wasn't enough to hold the insects for long; it will only last for three hours.After a month of fighting, Tess could only watch from the top of the pillar as both sides were dwindling. Her best men were being treated inside the fortress for bee stings and allergic reactions. The insects appeared less due to the different scents and smoke messing with their senses. Eventually, she started to give in to the spirits' request. Instead of giving the Singer to them, she decided to negotiate. ""Give us one year, and we will send you the girl for one day,"" she said. ""In return for giving you the girl, stop spreading pollen everywhere for five months."" The spirits agreed to Tess's terms.A year passed, the boy looked at the butterfly covered in pollen and flew into a rose to get nectar. The girl walks into the sea of roses, greets the boy, and sings a song. They dance and sing; when the day turns to night, the singer bows and returns home. Ten years later, the Dancer sees the Singer but realizes something is different. The Singer walks around the boy to look at his exposed back to find the scar on his left shoulder. He was startled by the sudden change in the girl. He has known the girl to have black hair and a crescent birthmark, but this person had brown hair with a crescent birthmark. She opens her mouth and sings the song. The Dancer ignored the sudden change and moved to the rhythm. Every ten years, the Singer changed, but she always had a crescent birthmark on her hand. The boy knew she wasn't the same person but dance to the same medley.One day, the boy picked up a stick and wrote in the dirt, ""why do you change your hair every ten years."" She said, ""It's a family tradition for the women in my family. To find a boy with a scar on his left shoulder and sing him a song."" He smiled and motioned her to sing the song. They performed like the butterfly and the drop of water. Two parties are working together to nourish the roses."
Trash Can Tillie,"This is a story about Trash Can Tillie.She was a tulip.Now you might wonder how Tillie came by her name.That is part of what this story is about so listen carefully to find out the answer. One day during all of Gods eternity, Tillie found herself in Gods Hands.She quivered when she heard His Voice speaking to her, felt His touch on her stem as He carefully held her. He said, Tillie, may I use you to bring glory to My kingdom? Amazing, thought Tillie, He was asking her for permission to use her.How like the gentle Creator.Tillie wondered how in the world God could use a simple little tulip to bring glory to the Master of the entire Universe.But He was Creator God.If He wanted to use Tillie, then He could do what He wanted.As these tulip thoughts flitted through her tulip mind, she thought about what an honor it was to be chosen to bless God.  Of course, said Tillie.Her little tulip heart was just a beating making her petals flutter even more than they had been.I would do anything for You, Father.Tillie, this assignment might be a tough thing for a little tulip, the Father said.Dont you worry, Tillie, Im always with you. I will never leave you alone and will send you help when you need it. Her tulip stomach had some jitters.Father, wherever I go, I know that You will be there just like You promise! Tillie, I am sending you to Earth to bloom for Me.Earth? she asked.All of a sudden, Tillies heart was not so excited after all.Her friends here were wonderful! In the gardens here, they bloomed forever and ever. She remembered hearing some flowers talking about this place called Earth.Tillie smiled and replied, What greater adventure could a tulip have than to bloom on Earth, kissed by Your sun! Right then and there Tillie decided in her tulip heart, I will bloom more beautifully on Earth than any other tulip ever has. Yipppeee! I have a job to do for the Father!To earth!Little did Tillie know what lay ahead of her.She was so brave and so nervous all at the same time. Tillies first memories of being on earth came when she found herself, a little bulb in the midst of all the other bulbs in Holland.Holland!Ive heard about Holland.Tillie was so excited. She had come to Holland the most famous tulip country in the world!Everybody knows thats where all famously beautiful tulips come from.Thank You, Father, she shouted!Hey, she yelled, ""whats going on?That tickles.Someone had put her on some type of a roller-belt and she was traveling along at a fast speed.She realized she was not alone.There were some other tulips rolling with her. One of her tulip brothers said, Hey havent you ever been on a production line before?Frankly, dear reader, he had never been on a production line either, but he had heard about it. Production line?What is that? Tillie asked. Hey Thomas, explain a production line to this little tulip, will ya? yelled Harry.Thomas was the one that had told Harry.Up in Heaven, another flower which had been on Earth had told Thomas.Sure, Harry, said Thomas.Okay, its like this ya see us tulip bulbs are going to be inspected andInspected, Tillie interrupted, Whats that mean, whats it for? Well, these guys here on Earth only want the best tulips to put in a package.So, they look us over to see if we are all there and if we will be a good bloomer, Thomas explained in a patient tone of voice.Oh, said Tillie.Well, by the time Tillie and her friends got off the conveyer belt, Tillie knew two things.First, that she was considered a premium bulb; and two, she was going to be packaged along with 5 other tulip bulb brothers and sisters. Why are we being put in a package, Harry? Tillie asked, not really sure what a package was.Harry explained, ""You really don't know much, do ya?We are going to be sold to a gardener who will take us home and plant us!""Harry continued, ""These gardeners are ver-r-r-r-y picky.They want only the best tulips.The packaging tells them everything they want to know."" After Tillie had been packaged with her brothers and sisters, she heard some loud talking.Okay.That is all of the shipment for now, said some man.  Are you sure?Those people at the J-Mart in Grand Rapids are not fun to deal with when the orders wrong, the other fella said. You got your roses, your pansies, your phlox, all the ground covers, and the best tulips that Holland, Michigan can offer! the first fella answered confidently.Michigan? thought Tillie.Michigan?Where is this place called Michigan?What about the windmills and the canals and the wooden shoes? she thought. And where on God's green Earth is Michigan? she puzzled. Oh well, Tillie sighed, I can bloom for the Father anywhere He wants and still be the most beautiful tulip!She was smiling again. After what seemed like hours and a lot of bumping and jostling inside a box inside a hot truck, her package came to rest in a storeroom at the J-Mart in Grand Rapids, Michigan.She listened to everything the truck drivers said hoping to find out just where shed go next.But she didnt really find that out.What Tillie found out instead was that the driver was worried because he might be losing his job.  He told his partner, If I lose this job, my wife and son, William, and I wont have any other place to live than some old family property right next to the city dump! said the man.The first guy laughed not realizing the second fella was serious.Father, she cried out in her tulip heart, please help this man and his wife and son, William.That dump place does not sound so good.I cannot do anything because Im just a tulip.But You can, Father, amen.The next day, her package, along with thousands of others, was put out on shelves in what was called the Garden Center.AND the excitement of all excitements!Her bag was promptly purchased. When they got to the purchasers home, the bulb bag was put up on a shelf in the garage.I thought we would be planted!said Tillie.Hey Tillie, Harry yelled from the bottom of the bag. It isnt autumn yet, he said. Dont worry.We were bought just in time!Everybody get ready to put down roots in Gods green earth! cried Harry excitedly.So, all the bulbs eagerly waited. Well, it got cold.Maybe today they will take us bulbs and plant us, all the bulbs chattered excitedly. Evening came, and the bag remained on the shelf.Disappointed, Tillie fell asleep.She woke up the next morning, thinking, Maybe today will be the day. She went to sleep that night and woke up the next day, hoping with her bulb brothers and sisters that they'd finally be planted.  Day followed day, week followed week, and then month followed month. Spring came, and Tillie and her brothers and sisters were still on the shelf.Oh, said Matilda the tulip, I wish I could just stretch up and out and feel the Sun on my face. Yes, cried another tulip brother.I just want to feel the dirt between my roots and talk to earthworms!Whats going on? Harry said just a little irritated.In her tulip heart, Tillie could not help but agree. Summer was hot in the garage that year.  Fall rolled around, and Tillie, along with her brothers and sisters, held her breath waiting.No planting that year.Not for Harry.Not for Thomas.Not for Matilda.Not for Joyce. And not for Tillie or her other bulb brother, John.Not that year or even the next. After the fourth year of shelf sitting, the other tulips just stopped talking.Tillie felt that some of them were angry with God, some of them just gave up. After all, didnt He assign them to bloom for Him?Well, WHEN?????Dear reader, sometimes it is hard while waiting for the Fathers right time for your season.Your special purpose might not happen when you think it should but just wait.Sometimes that wait might even be for years.But please, wait if you have to.Do not give up. While you are waiting, continue to talk to Him and to learn more about Him, and, yes, even more about yourself. Suddenly, there was a bunch of noise! Maybe it is time! squealed Tillie, excited with the prospect.It turned out to be something called a garage sale! Tillie and her tulip family were being offered to the one that was willing to pay $2 for her package.Well, maybe the new owner will be eager to plant us, she said.There were no replies from her brothers and sisters. The bulb sack went to another garage next to some fresh topsoil.Im so excited to feel that earth between my roots!To grow and stretch and stretch and break through the ground.To feel the sun on my face.To sway in the wind, cried Tillie more to herself than to any of her bulb buddies.The day came when the topsoil was removed and used.But the bulb sack with Tillie never saw the outside of the garage.The bulb sack had been pushed back out of plain sight during the commotion.  Now where are those tulip bulbs I bought?The owner looked and looked, but he never saw the little sack that had fallen behind two used tires.  Who knows how long Tillie waited.Suddenly, there was noise, laughter, bumping, pulling, more laughter everywhere!The bulb sack was leaving the garage!Yipee, Yappeee, Yahooie!Oh, joy!""Wake up! Wake up!"" Tillie shouted to her tulip brothers and sisters.No sound came from them. The joy was short-lived as Tillie listened and discovered that the owners were cleaning out the garage to make room for their cars. ""Hey Bob, I found a package of tulip bulbs here.Do you think Mom will want to plant them?""""Naaa,"" said Bob, Might as well throw that away with the rest of the trash.""Tillie felt the bag being carried down to the ""trash can"" with the rest of the garbage.It was smelly, dirty, dark.The bag was thrown into the garbage truck.There was a grinding of gears.The last thing Tillie remembered was the terrible pain from the crushing. It was a cold winter there at the dump.Tillie, with parts missing, was buried under trash and discarded food.""Oh no,"" cried Tillie.""They are going to keep dumping stuff on top of me and I'll never get to see the light of day.I'm going to die right here.""The smell was awful. If a tulip could cry, she would.Her tulip body had been torn and now, so was her tulip heart.Father, where are You?What happened to our plan?Have You forgotten?Tillie strained to hear His Voice.No answer.""Father, can you hear me?What about our plan?Where are You?Have you abandoned me?Left me here on this dump to die?Father...?"" Tillie pleaded.Not a sound.Tillie just laid there.Cold, damp rain penetrated the debris as Tillie waited for her inevitable decay. The sun came out.Spring arrived early that year.The warmth felt good.Tillie realized that she felt like stretching.So, she did.She stretched and stretched and stretched.It felt so-o-o-o good! Suddenly, she felt the kiss of the sun on her face.She opened up her eyes gazing up.What she saw thrilled her right down to her little tulip heart.She saw her Fathers eyes looking at her, her Father smiling at her.Oh, it had been a lifetime since shed seen Him!Father!Hello Father!Its me.Its Your little tulip.It's Tillie!His smile broadened if that were possible. Oh! He has not forgotten me! Tillie began to cry softly, then wept grateful tulip tears.Tillie thought of all the things she had been through after coming to Earth.Shed been sold and forgotten.Shed been left to wither up in two dark garages.Shed been thrown away and crushed, left to rot with the rest of the trash.And yet  in the midst of that decomposing mess, Tillie suddenly realized that Father had fed her the nutrients she had needed to finally fulfill her destiny, to bloom for Him.Here she was, smiling back at Him and waving her green petals in the wind.Youre the bestest Father in the whole universe!She waved and swayed and waved all day.It felt so good to move.Dear Reader, Tillie was a glorious sight out there in the midst of what life had discarded.She was a rich and beautiful red tulip stretching up for her Fathers kiss.She stretched and waved and danced to her hearts content. Later that day, a little boy, barefoot and dirty, was digging through the trash on the dump trying to find something special.He was muttering to himself picking up things, look at them, then throw them away. Suddenly, he saw Tillie.Hi, she waved.  He walked over and leaned down to smell.Tillie felt something gummy and moist on one of her petals. ""Oh yuck!His nose needed to be wiped!Yuck!Shed been slimmed!"" Tillie was grossed out! Suddenly, his mother called, William, William, where are you?Their shack was just over the hill from the dump.Theyd had to move there when daddy lost his job at the J-Mart.William played on the dump after school most days.Again, William, William, where are you?  William made a quick decision.Tillie had never felt such pain in her life.What was happening, what? She wondered if this was what dying felt like? The little boy was running, and Tillie was clutched tightly behind his back, upside down.If tulips could throw up, she would.When she thought she couldnt take another minute of the bouncing, he stopped. She was pulled out from behind him, flung up at a woman who was caught off guard.She looked at Tillie. Why William, she said, I dont think Ive ever seen a more beautiful tulip in all my borned days!Wherever did you find it?I did what you said, Momma.I prayed.Dear God, let me find my momma something special for her birthday.And poof! I opened my eyes, and there it was!Do you really like it, Momma?I love it, she said as she kissed him with tears in her eyes. Tillie was put into an old broken coke bottle filled with fresh water.While she couldnt see Fathers face, she felt His pleasure every time Williams mother glanced her way. The day came when all the tulip petals had fallen off.Momma had to discard the stem and water.As the remains of the tulip laid on the ground, Tillie felt her spirit caught back up to her Creator. Suddenly, every fiber of her being was jumping and popping all at the same time.Her entire being surged with energy like shed never felt before.She felt a shifting, a handing over.Tillie realized that she was in her Fathers Hands, the Ones that created her!His gaze was piercing, and she suddenly felt all of her little tulip life pass before Him for examination.The piercing was so deep that Tillie thought she might die.She heard all her thoughts and questions and fears from her time on Earth.Just then  when it was more than she could stand she heard a gentle rumbling, Well done My good and faithful little tulip. Tillie ducked her head and sadly continued, Im so sorry that I never was able to do what You sent me to earth to do.Tillie, said the Father.You served Me well and faithfully while on Earth.I sent you to Earth just for William and his mother.They needed to know that the truly beautiful things in life are simple and are from My Hand.You were the most beautiful flower that little boy or his mother ever saw,"" her Creator said. Williams mother had just talked to Me that morning, asking if I was there, asking Me what had happened to the plan for their destiny.  She said, Father, will You send me a sign in this smelly, dirty, deserted place.Send me something quite unexpected in the middle of this wasteland.Something beautiful and alive. When William came home with you in full bloom, she knew that I heard her.I used you to tell her that I still loved them.Your bloom has encouraged them to not give up.Tillie, I was quite proud of you and of how you never gave up, but waited until it was your time,' He said. Tillie trembled with the awesome knowledge that she had not waited in vain.Incredibly, shed been given the opportunity to help Him care for the family of the man at the J-Mart that shed prayed for.The Father was speaking again. Tillie, I am not going to send you to one of My gardens. Your faithfulness and trust in Me will be rewarded another way.You have truly pleased Me.You are so beautiful to Me that I am going to keep you right here beside Me in My throne room so that I might enjoy you for all eternity!You are Mine and in you, Trash Can Tillie, I am well pleased."
The treasure of the forest,"One more story, please!"" Said Anila. ""It is past your bed time"" says her mother. Anila begs for just one more story, ""please!!"" ""The one about the woodland creatures."" ""OK then"" says Anila's mother. ""Once long ago, there was a girl named Leilia. Leilia had never been outside before. Her parents were very strict. She wasnt allowed to go outside or have any pets. Every day, she wondered what the outside world looked like. One day, she couldn't stand her curiosity anymore, she had to know! The next night, she planned to sneak out. Leilia opened the window and jumped out. Luckly, her house only had one floor and the window was very close to the ground. She had packed her bags the night before. She brought a flashlight, a stuffed unicorn, tweesers, a sandwich and a rope. Leilia gasped at the sight, the air was fresh, the grass was green and the moon was shining bright.She walked for a while and began to get hungry, so she took out her sandwich and started to eat. Suddenly, a deer walked towards her and said ""You can't possibly finish all that yourself, can you?"" Would you consider sharing?"" Leilia screamed not because the deer had spoken, because she had never seen a woodlands creature before. ""Why are you screaming, little girl?"" Said the deer. ""Wh-who are you?"" Said Leilia. The deer looked shocked. ""Why, I am a deer, little girl!"" ""Oh"" said Leilia and gave the deer a little bit of her sandwich. The deer suddenly froze. ""Wait..."" it said ""you can understand me!?"" ""Uh yea I guess"" said Leilia. The deer was stunned. It came forward and looked into Leilias eyes and said ""Where are you going, little girl?"" ""I'm going to explore! I have never been outside before."" Responded Leilia. ""Please let me come with you"" said the deer hopefully. Leilia accepted the deer's offer and they trotted along the dirt road.They walked for a while until they came across a small whitey angry puppy. The puppy was making rather strange noises, between a growl and a whimper. The puppy was in too much pain to speak. Leilia spotted a giant thorn on the puppys leg. She quickly took out her tweesers and pulled out the thorn. The puppy stopped wimpering and looked at Leilia and the deer. Thank you by the way my name is Waggles. You are welcome, Waggles said Leilia, the pup felt much better. But then it froze. you can understand me? Asked the Waggles Yes, I can said Leilia.  I have something for you two. Follow me, Waggles went into a cave behind vines. Leilia and the deer cautiously followed. They were led into a dark room. Waggles put in a complicated password and the rock covering the door moved aside. They all slowly entered. There was a blinding light and a pile of gold and diamonds. Waggles said You may take 7 items each but dont take more than that. Leilia slowly took a gold crown, a diamond, a gold doubloon, a necklace, a bracelet and a plain staff. Next, the deer trotted up to the pile. The deer was not greedy but it didnt know how to count 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 counted the deer. When the deer put his treasure in the bag, the cave started to shake and the door started to close RUN!! screamed Waggles in a panic. They made it out just in time. Phew! they all were relieved. Thank you for the treasure Waggles, would you care to join our adventure? asked Leilia. Sure! said Waggles.Waggles, Leilia and the deer kept walking. They came to a small hut which was made of sticks. Inside the hut, there was a small bookstore filled with old books. Leilia loved books! She ran right in there with her animal friends screaming after her. NOOOO! Dont go there!!! You dont know whats in there! Listen to me, child! Leilia wouldnt listen but continued to walk in. The book store was old and dusty. There was only a skeleton sitting in the register. The skeleton was holding a book called The treasure of the forest. Leilia slowly took the book and opened it. A riddle fell out of it. I am high above. Dont look down but look up. Leilia showed her map and riddle to the deer and Waggles. Hmm they all wondered what the riddle meant. They looked all around, but didnt see anything. They spent hours trying to figure the riddle out.They were still trying to solve it When a girl about Leilias age walked towards them. Hi! My name is Ariana do you need help with that riddle? The deer had a crazy thought Can you hear me?? Hello?? babbled the deer. The girl just looked confused. All she could hear was wuf wuf and snuffles. She cant understand you whispered Leilia to the deer and dog. The girl apparently overheard You can understand them?? She said shocked. Yes answered Leilia. Ok, lets get started with the riddle said Ariana I am high above. Dont look down but look up. hmmm Ariana looked up, they all looked up they saw a small tree house among the trees. There was a small ladder. They all climbed up slowly. The door was locked! They all wondered how they would get in. There was a key hole in the shape of a staff. Suddenly Leilia took out her staff and put it in the hole. The door slowly creaked open. The tree house was the size of a castle! There were gold walls. It was so fancy! They found a card on the table it said congrats! This is yours now! everyone was happy and they lived together happily ever after in their new home. Wow that was a good story said Anila I wish I could talk to animals too! ""why would you want to talk to animals?"" asked Anilas mother. ""I want to be best friends with my goldfish!"" Goodnight! said Anila Goodnight replied Anilas mother."
A boy called Hans,"Once upon a time, when people used to listen to the stories that the wind wanted to share with them, there was a boy born in Fionia island, in Denmark. Which boy? and Why is this boy from such an old time so special to know about? These are two questions that may come to mind while reading these lines. And then again there is another thought which will most probably come to your mind. Oh, its a fairy tale. No time for fairy tales. Time is running, clock is ticking. The wind telling stories... this is fairy tales for young, really young kids.So,we are not young kids any more. Biologically at least. But what has this got to do with remembering how reviving it may be to let ourselves remember that youth may inhabit the fixed serious environment of adulthood? I am just asking. No need to be given the answer. Because deep down it is a matter of personal choice. Either you choose to feel only old enough not to listen to the winds stories or you choose to remember that listening to the wind may not be only for young kids, after all. You know my dear readers, today I remembered one of my most favorite quotes. There is no greater agony than an untold story bearing inside us. This is a quote of Maya Angelou. I have always believed that the power of words lies into quotes which have survived throughout years. If a set of words remains as a steady, popular point of reference for people, then this set of words talks to the human soul. The quote of Maya Angelou on the power of a story proves that each single creature, either human or non human is a story. And if this story is not expressed, is not narrated to others, is not shared and most importantly is not given the opportunity to communicate with all the other stories, then it turns into a burden. This kind of burden that makes our reality lose its taste, lose its breath and turn into a still boat anchored into a swamp. And then after the quote, I remembered this boy born on April, 2nd in 1805 in Fionia island in Denmark. This boy was Hans Christian Andersen. Does the name ring a bell? Do stories like The princess and the Pea, The Emperors new Suit, The Brave Tin Soldier, The Ugly Duckling have a tickling effect on your box of hidden or long forgotten memories?Hans was a kid carrying the heavy burden of an extraordinary imagination. A burden that cost him being called names like fool boy, the cloud-walking boy, the poor helplessly romantic boy. His mum was the only one supporting him. A boy orphan of his dad, entered the working field from his very early age. He tried to learn his dads job, the one of a shoe-maker but he didnt make it. So after school he joined a tailor but he failed there as well. He did not fulfil the expectations of mastering in this job of sewing. So, at the age of 30, Hans went to Copenhagen, having only 30 Danish Kroner in his pocket. His only fortune was the equivalent of 4.02 euros- if we wish to have a solid idea of what this meant- and his passion for telling stories. He had decided to make a living through being a storyteller and sitting the exams for actors held by the Royal Theatre of Copenhagen. But it was his non-promising appearance that cost him a place in the Theatre. So his fairy life began. Christian spent all his life storytelling. His fairy tales wereeither drawn from the rich Danish culture or created all out of scratch in his mind. His main heroes and heroines are poor, deprived of money people with no real chances of enjoying a proper meal. You see, society at those times was run by money earnings, belongings and origins. How familiar does this royame of Ownership in terms of materialismseem ? I am just wondering! But Hans heroes and heroines owned something that could not and still cant be put on the scales. They owned what we usually call ethical values or moral principles. They owned kindness, they had talent, they owned the ability of feeling generous for the fact that they could love and be loved no matter the dish of meal that would expect them on a table or not. And this is something that cannot be owned due to money earnings, materialistic fortune or origins. This is something owned because you choose to serve it. Hans works display the real icon and situation of the low social class of the 19th century and this is why his works and stories have found their place in the top representation of Danish literary production of the 19th century.Hans brought the air of the light satire in narrations which can shed light onto the real situation. Hans taught us that happiness goes hand in hand with misery. It is something like Halil Gibran said so many years afterwards. What makes you happy today, may give you tears tomorrow. Hans reminds us that it is ok to be sad, feel disappointed, frustrated or even something of a failure. But at the same time he shows that it is in our hands to listen to the stories which have not still been told to us. Our lives have stories to tell us, but it is a matter of choice isnt it? You can either hear or listen. I choose to listen. I choose to devote my time, despite the clock ticking, to listening to the narrations of the lives of others who cross my life. The date birth of Hans Christian Andersen has been established as the World Day of Celebrating Childrens Literature. Every year on April 2nd, people all over the world celebrate the World Day of Childrens Literature. But I remembered Hans today not so that we can listen to or read a story today. I remembered Hans today mostly because I feel that it is high time we found some time to listen to a story more often that only once a year on April 2nd. Enjoy your listenings of stories! And dont be afraid to share the stories you have either! But if it seems soooo difficult , then we can all start from remembering some of the stories that accompanied us as young, really young kids. We are adults, yes but the friends of our childhood timesmay keep their place in our adult lives. Fairy tales are not friends with an expiration date. Fairy tales and childrens literature are friends of life. Lets not neglect them! Happy readings!"
The mite and the chameleon,"There was once a chameleon who befriended a neighboorhood of insects. Everyday, it came to the Insect village to entertain the young insects whose parents were away for food hunting.""Would you like to see the color of the blue velvety sky today?"", the chameleon asked.""Show us, show us please?"", the young insects cried in unison.""Oh surely you have seen its colors when you go out each day"", it replied to them.""Yes we do, but since we are so tiny, we barely see it close enough."", one insect said.""Yes that's true"", the others agreed.And so the chameleon brought out a blue cloth, lied on it, and viola! The insects could barely see their entertaining friend because it blended perfectly on the cloth.""Wow! That's pretty amazing"", an insect said.""Do it again"", exclaimed the youngest of the brood.""Oh, let's try another game. How about we play hide and seek?""The little insects at once sprinted to their little feet. When no one was in sight, the chameleon blended with the dried leaves and tiptoed stealthily. This was its third time to visit the bug world and caught no less than ten of their youngs.""They would not think it's me behind the loss"", it thought to himself as it moved to find the nearest prey. His mind raced to the thoughts of different delectable delights he would make out of them.""I bet you could not change in all colors"".The chameleon turned to see a minuscule mite scratching what appears to be its body with its tarsal claws.Composing himself, the chameleon switched to fashion the color of the fresh leaves while walking towards the mite.""How about that for a color switch, little friend.."" it said, all the while preparing its first tongue-stretch for the day.""I bet you are no match to the lord chameleon of the North"", the mite said cooly.The chameleon's tongue dropped. His eyes bulged as he circled around the mite.""And who is this lord chameleon of the North that you speak of?""The mite brushed its bristles and hairs. ""Oh you probably don't know him. Pity, he must only prefer chameleon friends who can do as much switch colors as there is.""With raised spiked crests, the chameleon said, ""Try me... I can do as much as that lord or vasal cold-blooded reptile""""That's interesting. Let's see. For a starter, his majesty of the North can sneak into a lion's den without waking any member of the pack"", the mite challenged.Standing erect and looking ahead, the chameleon said, ""Stand aside. Keep pace and see me ace such job"".The young bug followed as the chameleon and watched him stealthily moved with its feet and fascicles. When they were few feet away from the lion's den, the mite whispered.""Just one more thing Mr. Chameleon the Challenger, his majesty of the North do bring something for its sweeth tooth""""Something what?"", the chameleon mumbled.""Oh something like a berry or two which it carries with its front toes, how cool for a chameleon champ he is"" the mite said with pride.""Consider it done. How does a bunch of blackberries sound?"", withdrawing from mites, it it clawed its way up a blackberry.""Wow, you are one mighty rival to his majesty of the North... go my future King Chameleon, prove your valor worthy of the title. But first you must rest my mighty one, and wait for the perfect timing. You see, the lord chameleon of the North only sneaks into the lions' den when he sees a signal - as for you, make your move my future King when you see a firefly just before the den's mouth.""""Very well, I shall.be ready with your signal.""Feeling the crown as an added glory to its head ornamentation, the chameleon clawed its way up once again to the nearest bark. He could not wait to march gloriously to the lion's den. Meanwhile, the mite rushed to the hive of bees they passed by.""What's the rush you little mite?"" the queen bee asked.""Oh mother of the bees, your majesty, ten of my friends have been eaten by a cunning chameleon. Please help me save the lives of the others from our village from him"", the mite requested.The mite recounted how he lured the chameleon to the lion's den.""So you want us to wake the lions the moment the chameleon is inside their den?""""And if I find favor to your eyes my queen, please encircle the chameleon too""The queen approached the mite. ""You really want the end of him, do you think that is fair?The mite bowed down, ""Oh no my queen, I would not go down to the level of a jungle specie killing its own... please trust me on this one, your majesty"".""Very well,"" the queen said. ""There is not time to spare. Vanguard bees, buzz the word, I want three swarms of your most valiant and buzzing bees to do this mission""""And one more favor my queen"", the mite said in a low voice.""Yes my dear, what is it?""""If I could just make my way faster there, there is one more task I need to do to make this mission work.""""Very well, I will fly you over there myself in no time.""Before the mite can say a word, the queen grabbed it by its sternal plate and for the first time, it went up, up and up.""The world is so beautiful from up here"", each second gripping tighter with its vow to make his plan work.""This is how far I can go,"" the queen said, landing him in the middle of the lion's den. ""My soldier bees must be here any second. I trust in you, you can do this""He bowed low, and with the queen gone, the mite rushed to his plans.Summoning a firefly pal, it sent the signal for the chameleon. Eager to claim its mighty throne - as King Chameleon I, the chameleon made its stealthiest moves inside the den. But it was not a step closer to the middle, it heard the buzzing sounds. Before it can blink, the bees were around him""What the... it must be these berries..I am so stupid! That mite... just wait and see"", it thought. It threw the berries to shoo the swarms but it was too late. Awakening the lions, the chameleon sprinted like he never did before, but not fast enough for the King to grab hold its tail.""Oh mighty and wise one, I was just passing through"", it said with a wide grin, making effort to show its teeth to add sincerity to its feeble smile.The mite appeared at the moment and said, ""Oh King, you by far work hardest to make.our jungle safe for everyone. As a present, may I present to you from the Insect Village, a gift of gratitude. This chameleon is by far a great entertainer my lord. May you find his color switching tricks relaxing to you and your pack""The King accepted the gratitude of gift, amused with the sample color tricks it saw from the shivering, grinning chameleon.And so the mite returned to the village with its new found allies of bees, happy and thankful to save the day for all its kinds."
The Boy That Always Lied,"Once upon a time, there was a little boy, living in a village. A village, quite remote, where the closest town, village and city, was a good hour by horse ride.      This young boy, Peter, from a young age, had always found his way out from stressful situations just by lying to people. For him, it was a quick fix. A quick way to get rid of the problem, a bandage on an injury. He never thought of the long-term consequences. He never thought of a permanent fix, orjust to be honest with respect to the situation or people involved.      At school, Peter would be the student that often would arrive late in the morning for his classes. He would have excuses such as the weather was not in his favor, that he had to help his mom in the barn, that he had to help an elderly man with his grocery bags, etc. The excuses were endless.      Peter was good at telling tales. Well, liesthat would be not just a simple lie but a lie that would affect many people, a group of people, an institution or even the entire village.      During summer vacation, Peter would help with the familys farm business. They owned a flock of sheep. Peter was responsible to take the sheep out for grazing. This was a good way for his parents to get Peter involved in this field of work. Also, to show him what is the feeling of a hard working day. That money does not grow on trees.      Peter, when conducting his duties, but would most of the time get lost in his thoughts. He would not pay attention to the flock. Some times, once he was back with the flock to the farm, his parents would notice that he is missing a sheep or two. Peter would use the excuse that maybe a wolf caught a sheep and devoured it. When you lose a sheep or two, a month, that is bad for business.     Peter knew, that there were no wolves ever reported, seen or witnessed in the entourage. Peter knew that he simply neglected to keep an eye on the flock.      Peters parents were paying him an allowance for his work. With his lack of effort, Peter was afraid to lose his allowance. He was thinking of getting a new bicycle with that money pocket. Peter started officering his services to others in the village. At first, Peter was careful. Later, after a few weeks, he would become lazy at his tasks, and neglect the flock of sheep. The villagers would ask the boy if there was a reason of the missing sheeps. The answer from the lying boy would be the same. That probably a wolf was near by.     On Monday, a new week, back to school and Peter got late to school by five minutes. When the teacher asks the reason for not being punctual today, the boy said that he had take care of his ailing mom. She had a high fever and he had to run to the doctors home. This was not true.     After school, Peter got late home. When his parents ask him where he was, his answer was that he had stayed after school to get extra hep in math by her teacher. Again, that was not the truth. He went to play with some kids that live closer to the school.      Incidents like this kept on going for weeks, months, and few years. The boy did not mean any harm to anyone but his lies were a huge disrespect to people.     One day, after the school year had ended, and Peter was looking to make big bucks. He had taken the task to take on the flock of sheep of his family farm and the neighbors as well. He was imagining the money he would get from doing two jobs in one. He knew he was not going to put too much effort. This time, he decided to bring with him his dog Brutus. A German Shepperd. That can be a big boost in containing the sheeps and a better surveillance.      It was Saturday afternoon. The grazing spot was an hour way from his house. A quiet place to let the sheeps have their free time to socialize, eat, and enjoy the fresh air.      While the sheeps were carrying their activities, Peter decided to take a rest under a tree. The family dog was gone, far away. Peter was not looking at him or the sheeps.      When Peter woke up after a good two-hour nap, the sheeps seemed all there and the German Shepperd was not seen around. It was so silent. So quiet. So peaceful. It seemed like a dream.      It was time to return home. Gather the troop. As Peter was standing and started walking forward, he hears not one, but two growling wolves. The little boy is standing between them. What to do? The first instinct was not to move. After a few minutes, the wolves were in an immobile position. Looking at Peter as their next meal perhaps. It almost seemed like a staring contest but the little boy was keeping his eyes low. Not staring at them. He knew at this point he needed to run or scream for help. There was a village not far. By walk, maybe three minutes.     Do or die? The wolves are hungry. The boy shouts out loud as hard as he can. Screaming for help     You knowno one is going to listen to you today, says one of the wolves.      Let me go.     You are our meal for this evening. Even though you are not lying by asking help, people are going to ignore you today. Only tomorrow morning they will realize that you were telling the truth. Maybe the first time in your life, and perhaps the last time as well     As the closest villagers hear the sound of distress of the little boy, no one seems to be paying attention.      Dont worryit must be Peter. How many times he has mentioned that a wolf attached his flock when we have never seen a wolf in this forest. He is probably preparing his next excuse for this parents, explains one villager to another villager while they hear screams of the little boy."
Silverskin,"Once upon a time there lived a miller and her husband and their daughter Silverskin in the land just to the left after the forest. One day the miller said to her daughter:Silverskin, you must go to the village and buy some rapeseed oil for the mill. The wheels are squeaking and the flour comes out coarse.	Silverskin was a beautiful and kind-hearted young woman, and many boys from the village and the surrounding farms had already been courting her  but in vain, because Silverskin was sure there was a one and true love for her and she was determined to find that man. That's why she gladly went on errands to the village, even if it took the whole day to get there and back; she was hoping to meet the love of her life.	This day she arrived at the village later than usual; it was a cold and windy day and a heavy rain had made the forest path dark and slippery. Although she kept her eyes open, she did not see any handsome prince or shining white knight, only a big stable boy, a dirty blacksmith apprentice and a gang of good-for-nothing layabouts, all of them whistling and cheering after her. She made her errands and began her journey back with the heavy barrel of oil in a leather harness over her shoulder. She had to hurry if she were to come home before dark.	She'd been walking for a good hour and was well into the forest when she suddenly heard a cry for help. She left the path and hurried towards the sound, hoping to help the person in need before it was too late. She ended up in a small grove surrounded by ancient trees, some as old as time and barely alive - and in the middle of the grove Silverskin saw the most beautiful apparition she had ever seen. Hair like angel feathers, skin like snowflakes made of peach juice and milk, lips like a shimmering, one-coloured rainbow high above the clouds. Silverskin couldn't move. Her heart was beating faster, not from the dash through the dense undergrowth, but from strange feelings that surprised her with overwhelming intensity, feelings that could not be explained because they were unreasonable. It was a girl, with one leg jammed deep within the roots of the old trees. A girl that had stopped crying and now stared back at Silverskin with the same bewilderment. The girl was smiling, and her wet cheeks glistered like stars on velvet. Silverskin didn't notice, but she was smiling too, smiling because she was happy to see the other girl smile and happy because the universe was such a marvellous place where there could exist such beauty.	For a long time they just stared at each other, then Silverskin stepped forward and reached out her hand.	Is this... heaven? she asked.	If it is, the other girl answered, I don't want to go back to earth.	My name is Silverskin, Silverskin said.	Silverskin. the girl whispered slowly, tasting it like a piece of candy. That's the most beautiful name I ever heard. Silverskin. She took Silverskin's hand and it burned without being hot and it was freezing without being cold and it was soft as an open wound that did no longer hurt. My name is Princess Red. It used to be Princess Blue because I was so cold, but now it is Princess Red because I am warm, and you have opened my heart.	And you shall remain Princess Red for you have opened your heart and I am stepping in and I shall never leave:	They embraced, and Silverskin poured the rapeseed oil over the roots that had caught Princess Red's ankle so that she could slip free and then they talked for hours, and even if the night grew cold and dark they stayed warm in each other's closeness and their bodies shone like daylight. Suddenly Princess Red became sad.	My father, the King, she began, is a very old and very kind man and I love him, but he will never let us get married. A miller's daughter isn't good enough for him  let alone a girl. We must run away; we must move to another kingdom, far away, where nobody knows us and where we can get married and live the rest of our lives together.	I cannot take you from your father, who you love and who surely loves you too, Silverskin said. I will find a way to make him like me enough to let me be his daughter-in-law. I will leave you when the sun rises. Go back to the big city and your castle and wait for me. I won't be long.	They stayed together the rest of the night until the sun shot its first rays of light though the striding morning fog and the loud voices of the King's men, searching for the princess, echoed among nearby trees. With tearful eyes they kissed each other goodbye, and Silverskin ran into the forest and through the bog and over the moor and all the way home.	Her mother and father had been worrying all night and were so happy to see that no ill fate had befallen their daughter that they did not reprimand her for the missing rapeseed oil. But when Silverskin told them, most truthfully, of what had passed during the night, they were not so pleased.	Silverskin, my child, her mother said, you cannot love a woman. What about Erk, the butcher's handsome son  or Nils at the manor, he is rich and he has been asking for you?	Love doesn't knock on the door, love doesn't ask to be let in, Silverskin answered. Love invades, and there is nothing I can do about that.	Then you are no longer our daughter, her father said.	That night, saddened by her parents' firm conviction but unable to act according to their wishes, Silverskin packed a bag and left her home. She had not travelled more than half a day's journey before she stumbled upon a handsome man, hanging upside down from a tree branch across the path.	Sweet maiden, he pleaded. Save me.	I will help you. said Silverskin. But as she started to climb the tree into which the trap was attached, a fierce looking troll emerged from behind a cluster of birches.	Do not touch my prey, the troll roared.	 prey? Silverskin said, turning towards the hideous monster. This is my prey. I set the trap this very morning and now I have caught a delicious manchild. I will have him for supper.	The troll looked confused. This is my trap, it said. I set it several weeks ago and now it has finally caught me some food. It took a step forward.	Listen, its very easy: You wouldn't think of not saying that this isnt not you trap but that trap being not over there wasnt my trap. Don't you agree?	Eh, yes. When you put it like that The troll was very uncertain. But I always set my traps fifty paces apart. Over there He pointed at a spot further away along the road, There must be another of my traps.	Silverskin went over to the indicated spot, carefully looking out for a trap mechanism. She spotted the trigger, well hidden in a tuft of grass, almost invisible from above. She began to stomp the ground like a madwoman, as hard as she could, but at a safe distance from the trigger.	Look! she called out.There is no trap over here.	The troll hurried over to confirm Silverskins findings but did not see the grass tuft and trigger. A rope sprang up from the dust and dirt, writhed itself around the trolls ankle and lifted it, upside down, high up from the ground.	Oh,I didnt see that, Silverskin said.	Help me, the troll begged. If my friends find me like this they will laugh at me for two hundred years. If you help me Ill give you a flask of Troll Potion.	Silverskin gasped. She knew that Troll Potion was very rare and very valuable. If you drank it you could become  or  you liked for an hour.	Yes, Silverskin said. That sounds fair enough. And she untied the knots and the troll fell to the ground with a thump.	Thank you, the Troll said and stood up. You are very kind. If you ever become a princess, I promise I will not eat you. Here is the potion. He handed a green flask to Silverskin and then he vanished into the woods.	Silverskin went back to the other trap where the handsome man still hung upside down in the air. She carefully untied the knots and lowered him to the ground.	Thank you, he said, brushing off some dust from his trousers. You are, as the troll said, very kind and wise. You are also beautiful like a water lily in a moonlit pond. I am a prince. One day I will be king and I can make you very happy. Will you marry me?	I am sorry, Silverskin answered and smiled, but my heart belongs to another.  After several days of walking and several nights of loneliness and longing, Silverskin finally reached Eldor, the capital of Eldoria. But when she entered the city, she began to hear rumours that Princess Red was about to get married to a wealthy prince from the north. This could not be true, Silverskin thought. There must be some mistake.	But there was no mistake. The city was preparing for a royal wedding; shopkeepers were decorating their storefronts and street musicians were singing songs about the royal couple. Multicoloured paper garlands hung from every nook and cranny and the smell of fresh paint and roasted chestnuts filled the air.	Silverskin was devastated. She walked up to the castle and asked to see the princess. The palace guards promptly grabbed her, carried her down to the river and threw her into the dirty water. Soaking wet and temporarily disheartened she thought there had to be another way. She went back to the guards and told them that she was a florist and had come to the palace to work. One of the guards went inside to check with the decoration committee. Luck had it that a young florist apprentice had just been fired and the decoration team was one florist short. They had sent a message to the decorators guild for a replacement and was quite astonished by the quick response. Silverskin was immediately led into the castle and handed over to a pompous woman.	Put on this apron, she said, and take this bunch of buttercups to the second floor.	The second floor was where Princess Red lived. With a heart thumping like a galloping horse, Silverskin went up to the princess room and knocked on the door.	Go away, a frail voice from within the room answered. I need to be alone.	Silverskin opened the door defiantly and entered.	For a few seconds Princess Red looked at her visitor with mouth open and cheeks flaming red from too many tears. Then she threw herself into Silverskin's arms.	You came, she sobbed. You shouldnt.	I promised you I would come for you. Life without you is too unbearable, now that I know you exist. I had to come.	But it is too late. And I have made up my mind. I am going to marry the prince, because that is what a princess does. I cannot disobey my father and I cannot break this ancient tradition. With a heart broken like an egg under the hoofs of a warhorse, I have to do it. My life will go on without joy.	Crying like a mourner at a funeral, she ushered Silverskin out of her room, and after a last and desperate kiss she closed the door. The day of the wedding began with a rumour spreading through the city. The rumour said that the princess had vanished from the castle during the night. The rumour also said that she had eloped with a secret lover; or that she had been murdered by a jealous princess from another country; or that she had been cursed by an aunt and was now living as a house mouse.	When the rumour reached Silverskin, she ran up to the castle and asked the servants and yes, the princess was gone. The true story was that she had been taken by the Iron Dragon, who lived in the mountains above the city. Silverskin had heard enough. She gathered her few possessions and left for the mountains. She walked for fifty hours and she walked until her feet bled and her legs sent pangs of pain through her body for every step she took. She would never give up because her love was stronger than any pain. She didn't eat, she didn't sleep and she didn't rest. She walked until her shoes were gone and she walked until her clothes were worn and torn - and then, suddenly, she stopped. A predatory roaring and the smell of burnt wood and sulphur told her she had arrived at last at the dragons den.	Crawling under some bushes she soon discovered the mighty Iron Dragon himself, standing on a cliff shelf in front of a dark cave. Silverskin already had a plan, so she backed off to a nearby glade and opened her satchel.	She still had the priceless Troll Potion - and if it was ever going to be used, it was now.	Please make me in the shape of a Golden Dragon, she whispered to the vial. A powerful and big and beautiful one that will instill both fear and admiration. And then she swallowed the potion.	Her body felt like it was filling up with live herrings, flapping their tail fins and twisting their spines. The ground seemed to race away from her, and moments later she had turned into a beautiful, strong and very convincing Golden Dragon. And she could fly. She flew high up in the sky where she could see the city and the mountains and the whole kingdom, and then she descended and landed in front of the Iron Dragon. She was much bigger than him, and he immediately lowered his head and looked down at the ground.	Greetings, gilded one, he fretted. By what honour do I receive Your attention?	I have come for the princess, Silverskin answered, as demanding as possible.	But...I went through so much trouble getting her.	That is why my appreciation is so much greater.	The Iron Dragon hesitated for a second, but, confronted with a senior golden dragon, he didn't have much of a choice. Please wait here. Ill go and fetch her. He turned around and went into the cave and was gone for a few minutes.	When he came back, he was dragging Princess Red in a rope behind him. She looked terrified. Dirty as a mud collector and tied so tight that she could hardly breath.	Be cautious with this one, the Iron Dragon said. She is a princess, and you know how easily they break.	I know exactly how precious they are, Silverskin answered. And this one is special. She is part of a prophecy and must never be touched. Do you understand me?	Yes, my Lady.	With all the care in the world, Silverskin grabbed Princess Red, lifted her up in the air and flew away, leaving the Iron Dragon behind. An hour had soon passed and Silverskin had to land in a clearing by a brook before her ability to fly came to an end. She put down Princess Red by the water and untied the ropes. While she did so, she began to shrink, and in front of the princess astonished eyes, she turned back into herself again.	Silverskin, the princess rejoiced. It is you. But how..?	I told you I would come for you. I love you, and here I am:	Princess Red threw herself into Silverskins open arms and hugged her as if she would fall into a bottomless chasm if she ever let go.	I wont marry the prince, she sobbed. I understand now. Life is more precious than just living like a prisoner, and a life without you is nothing but a prison. I will marry you, no matter what. My kingdom will have to find another queen. But we have to go back to my father and mother. I want to say goodbye and explain why I must leave.	Yes. At least they will be happy to know that you are alive. They walked, hand in hand, back to the city and into the Royal Castle. Still hand in hand, they made their way to the throne room.	Father. Mother, Princess Red said with a trembling voice. I was captured by a fierce dragon and was surely meant to be devoured. But I was saved by brave Silverskin, the beautiful woman that stands here beside me. I love her more than life itself and I will marry her, if she wants me, no matter what the law and traditions says. If we have to live in exile, so be it.	The King and the Queen sat silent for several minutes, but in the end their happiness that Princess Red was alive and their gratefulness to Silverskin, who had saved their precious daughter, won over traditions and rules.	If we have to change the law, the king proclaimed, then we change the law. If we have to break traditions and rules, we invent new traditions and rules. Traditions and rules that make my daughter happy. Silverskin, will you have my daughter, who now seems to call herself Red, to be your wife?	Silverskin fell on her knees and bowed. Yes, my liege. I will take and honour her for the rest of my life."
Something in the Water,"Hi Lenny. Hello, I replied to the lank-haired guy in horn-rimmed glasses, sitting about three rows from front. The host, Jerome, had picked him as hed the one being most insistent with his hand-waving. Jerome was probably grateful that someone looked more nervous than he did. I shot a glance at him before turning to listen to the question from the audience member. He was holding the mic at arms length, like it was a snake about to bite him.  Um, so, as Im sure a lot of us are wondering, but, err, how is it you get your ideas for these retellings?  Stuttered foreplay, followed by frenetic expulsion of that generic old chestnut. I swallowed my sighs as I began my well-rehearsed answer. Which was itself another fiction.  I dont think anyone here at the Q&A, not Jerome picking away at the frayed end of his sleeve or wavy glasses guy or even the kohl eyed gaggle of goths at the back couldve handled the truth of how Lenny Spoors became a best-selling author of twisted fairy tales.  It began with my little brothers night terrors. I heard my mouth trotting out all the usual stuff about news headlines and occult research, but really, it all went back to lil Cam. Id lost count of the number of times hed wake me up with his screams when it all started that summer. Or his thrashings and mouth going like a fishs when he wanted to yell, but was unable. Our parents got together young and they liked to party hard still, out all hours, so it would usually be me administering words of comfort and fresh bedsheets.  Other times hed just be mumbling. Still agitated, but at least not shouting the house down. Sometimes Id talk back to him, hoping to calm him down. The one word volleys wed toss back and forth gradually became longer dialogues. I heard names I recognised from books that had been mine that now lived on his side of the room. Dr Seuss, Hans Christian Anderson, The Brothers Grimm, Philip Pullman  yeah, a bit heavily stacked on the male writers, but Im just telling you what we had to hand. The little guy had clearly been affected by these stories and yeah, lets face it, a lot of them were scary to start with, even before his embellishments.  It started getting  weird the night when he got up for a glass of water. The light from the landing woke me up. I wondered whether to get out of bed and check on him, make sure he wasnt about to sleepwalk off the balcony or something. But he came back and we both drifted off back to sleep. I dont know how long for, but when I woke up he was babbling. Eyes wide open. Holding out his hands to touch things only he could see. This wasnt the usual sleep talking. I whipped my journal out from under the mattress and started taking notes.  I asked him about it the next day when I was getting us both ready for school (the rents mustve been a big bender that week). Turns out hed just taken a glass of water that had been sitting on the coffee table. More convenient than going to the kitchen sink. Dude, justno. I looked up from tying his shoelaces to roll my eyes at him. Why Lenny? Whats wrong? How to explain to your younger brother that the parents he idolises are part-time junkies? Liable to leave their illicit substances all over the house but especially the coffee table, where theyd end up sitting around on heavily stained cushions with an even heavier rotation of peculiar guests.  Thered been something in the water that night.  That evening I remembered the notes Id scrawled and read them over. Piecing together the scraps that had infiltrated from Cams otherworldly psychedelic tour, there was some actual entertaining stuff there. I half-forgot these were my little bros hallucinations and became invested in the stories. I decided I would try writing more down. Fleshing them out. I slept lightly for a few weeks, trying to train myself to be alert to his stutters and mumbles. But nothing he came out with was on a par with that fateful night with the glass of enhanced H2O. The remaining empty pages of my journal waited expectantly.  One night I went looking around the living room for my geography textbook. It had been reappropriated as a coaster for a tankard of someones leftover cloudy cider. As I looked at the surrounding detritus, I knew what had to be done.  Have you brushed your teeth, Cam? Yes, Lenny, he cried from our room.  Good work, I called back, dropping a tab into a glass of water, bracing myself for it to froth over in kaleidoscopic colours, feeling like the worlds worst mad scientist. It didnt, and I wasnt. I took it to my brother. Got you something, I said. He looked up, face shining, expecting a toy or something hed need to brush his teeth again after. I had to hide a smile when I saw his disappointment. So you save yourself a trip in the night, I explained, putting it down by him. Actually, why dont you have a couple of glugs before bed? Sgood to keep hydrated, yknow. Stops ya getting pimples as well. I pointed at the one on the side of my nose which hed been ragging me about. I flared my nostrils. Watch out! Volcanos about to burst!  He squealed and burrowed under his covers. But he poked a hand out. Okay, gimme. I watched him drink. And waited, pen in hand.  Back in 2021, I hear myself winding down the end of my patented spiel. Mind and body both fully back in the book shop Ive already forgotten the name of. Wavy glasses guy is nodding intensely, probably not having taken in anything Ive said because hes so excited hes had his little bask in my limelight. Now Jerome is saying something, probably reiterating what Ive just said, to show the audience how in tune he is with me. What great rapport.  I had to ask for the next question to be repeated. I was busy thinking I should really pay my brother a visit. Hes only about a half hour drive away from this town. Yes. Cam may have forgotten theres a face attached to that name that sends him cheques once a month.                                            *           *            * Its strange, this: walking alongside my brother, hearing his feet crunching leaves, instead of hearing him pacing around the department marked WRITERS ROOM in my mind. Hearing his voice, slow, monotonous, like cassettes used to sound when the batteries in your stereo were dying, instead of the cartoonish frenzy I conjure when I flip back through my notebooks mining our past conversations for more ideas. With what Im paying, I guess theyve got him on the good meds here. Collect royalties, pass Night Nurse, straight to horse tranquilisers. Weve been walking around a square patch of lawn for a while now so my mind has gone to board games. Im not sure whos winning and whos the loser.  Thats my friend, Cam says. Is he now? Im doing that voice you do when youre visiting your great-grandmother who cant always remember who you are and youre treading carefully because shes holding the butter knife. Cams pointing at a guy who looks like a cross between Santa and Marlon Brando (in his later years). A fairy godfather? Uh-uh. I tell him stuff. Thatsthats cool, I say. Im glad youve made a pal in here. I go to pat Cam on the shoulder but he flinches, only slightly, so instead I brush an imaginary insect off my own shoulder.  Were coming up closer to the fairy godfather now, who appears to be deep in conversation with a tree. Its our, what, tenth lap of this square and Im still nursing a slight headache from raiding the hotel minibar late last night after signing about a hundred books. I pray I dont have to make conversation with the snowy-haired gent. At least I know Cams triggers. I dont know if the fairy godfather would take a nice weather were having as a sign to start playing Zeus.  To my relief, they just wave at each other and FG carries on conversing with the tree.  I do a few more laps with Cam until I make a play of noticing my watch and oh wow would you look at the time. He accepts my handshake as I leave. His nails are ragged. I remember telling him off when we were kids for biting his nails. Parenting when I should have been brothering. I choke down the tennis ball thats suddenly grown in my throat.  Later on, in another nondescript hotel room, I dream. My dreams are usually mentionable for being non-existent. I call it my writers refuge. My mind is buzzing with stories all day so no wonder it prefers being a blank canvas at night. But this time I dream of walking with Cam. Only its not leaves were crunching. I look down and its a sea of skulls. Skulls belonging to all the people Cam could have become. And theres ol FG, laughing, tears running down his ruddy cheeks, holding on to one of the branches of the tree. I walk over to the tree, wondering whats so funny. I must have in on this joke.  As I get closer, the tree splinters, knotholes burst open and all the fae folk come tumbling out. Goblins and pixies and nymphs, oh my. Theres even a unicorn galloping down through the mists at the top of the tree. The birds have heard, and they want words. Tiny fairies heave off their bluebell bedclothes and together shine their light on me.  The fairy godfather notices me and I worry hes about to bust a gut laughing. Then his nose is two inches from mine, flecking me with spittle as he tells me  THE FAE FOLK WILL HAVE THEIR REVENGE."
The truth shall set you free,"Three things cannot be long hidden: the Sun, the Moon and the Truth.With this quotation by Buddha, little, malformed Kokknis closed his book, reclined against tree stock and drove himself into his land of dreams where truth always prevailed under his aegis. Kokknis was brownie type of fairy. He had been frequently bullied by his fellow faries for his physical appearance as well as for his contemplations over all the injustices and lies of royalty. But he never mind those fellows instead their degrading remarks always reminded him of words of his mother; you are very special my son, God has created you for some bigger task and with this she used to quote Sophocles one must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.On one fine day, Kokknis was going towards river side with his favorite book in hand. On his way, he saw gnarled courtier. Courtier was addressing facile public. Kokknis also joined the mob of listeners. But to his astonishment, gnarled courtier was there not to ask problems of public but to manipulate them to achieve evil goals of royalty and to conceal their lies. This was unbearable for veracious Kokknis and he spoke out Platos words false words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil. Interpose was irksome but controlling his temperament, gnarled courtier asked for the interposer. Kokknis stepped foward spunkly. As soon as courtier and public got glimpse of little, deformed Kokknis, they all laughed out hysterically. Halt, said Kokknis by raising his right hand. Monarch is ruling over us since forever and we the people of fairyland are obeying them without questioning their diabolical laws. But now its time for change. Now in tough times neither we want to listen why dont they eat cakes by those who have no idea how to earn daily bread and butter nor we want finagled commandments. We, the residents of fairyland want our rights and also we want our royals to be truthful with us. Courtier was not happy with the monologue of a deformed brownie. He felt insult because according to him, the low social strata of brownies compelled them to stay mute, they were supposed to be ugly, mindless creatures whose purpose was to serve only. Im not obliged to answer any deformed brownie gnarled courtier bawled. I was here just to inform people how hard their rulers are trying to make people content. This kind of unthankful behavior by low class is an insult for them. Saying this, he stamped his foot, turned and left. Crowd started muttering and started to leave the place. Situation was agonizing. Kokknis asked people to stop and listen to him but they all displaced themselves slowly.As soon as courtier reached the royal palace, he made appearance before the Royals and informed them about deformed brownie and warned them about smell of revolution. One of the senior Royals said hatefully, how naive he is to say a word against us having no knowledge that we are experienced in crushing revolts. He, the member of lowest class of the society, how could he dare to spark revolution against us. Aaaa! Michiavelli was a wise man and I endorse his words which are; a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep his promises when such observance would place him at disadvantage. What he said about commandments? He has given us clue that he is having a close eye on our actions and noticing how smartly we are manipulating the rules according to our convenience and interest. But enough now, he is going to pay a heavy price for this insolence and we the Royals will punish him so his end will deterrent others. Other Royals smirked and their inkling was indication that something big was going to happen.Story of Kokknis audacity before courtier spread like a wild fire in fairyland and everyone started passing comments according to their merit. Some appreciated his courage and some disapproved of this rude behavior by a member of lowest class. Some made their minds to support Kokknis but there was also a group who was fearing that they will also face the consequences. Whole fairyland was in different kind of frames of mind and were waiting for the torment inflicted by the Royals upon them.Next morning, there was announcement that all members of the fairyland should be gathered at oldest oak tree to hear the message from the Royals. By noon, all fairyland was present under the shade of the big, old oak tree. Messanger came, took a bird eye view of the crowd, cleared his throat and open the message roll and read it out aloud with a confidence in his voice. I, the messenger of the Royals, is here to clear some of your doubts. You all are aware of the discourteous deformed brownie who attempted to degrade the representative of our the Royals just to spread chaos in our lovely peaceful fairyland. We, the fairies of fairyland are spending our lives peaceful under this monarch since ages and we all are well aware that they have sacrificed their peace of mind and nights sleep for the well-being of ours. They do have changed some banal rules and commandments but not for themselves but for you fairies and if in this scenario you doubt actions of the Royals than this is injustice from your side. Just to maintain your trust and to show love, the Royals have decided a grand lunch tomorrow and they want all of you to join. End of announcement!!!Next evening there was great hustle and bustle in the palace. All fairyland was present there except the Kokknis but tyrants were wrong in perceiving that absence of Kokknis would be unfelt by invited guests in coruscation of the great feast because truth cannot be concealed. When all fairies were having dinner and chit chat, suddenly someone sparked discussion about Kokknis and all invited guests caught attention towards absence of Kokknis. Not finding Kokknis between them was worrisome for some fairies but some other faries equated his absence with defeat of truth. Sparkling discussion and questions about absence of Kokknis reached ears of the Royals too and informer informed them that this could lead to discomforting situation. As this meeting was going on, suddenly a person rose and asked what tact the Royals have tried to shut the mouth of the truth. Tone of the questioner was rude and threatening because the Royals had never imagined that any Tom, Harry and Dick would ever question them. This was an insult. Shut up! said one of the Royals in anger, we are not here to justify our deeds. We are here to rule and to rule is our by birth right. One of the moth tried to degrade us and now many among you are following his wrong path. Beware! Else the end is terrific. Hearing this threat, many guests started to leave the party. This was the start of revolution.When fairies returned their town, they found injured Kokknis hanging by the oak tree. This scene was sad and terrifying at the same time. They rescued Kokknis. As rescued, Kokknis quoted Sophocles and said the truth is what I cherish and thats my strength, after saying these words, Kokknis soul left his body. Fairyland bemoaned the loss of veracious Kokknis but they were well aware that they cannot rewind the past and bring back that silly deformed brownie on whose ideas and contemplations they used to laugh and condemned him for being a day dreamer and vanguard of truth.Next morning, in the town there was a curfews sort of situation. Men from the Royals were everywhere. But now fairies were angry too. It was impossible to stop their protest. Now fairies wanted truth and justice, no more dissembled faces because fairyland wasnt a city of any single fairy or monarch but of all fairies. People were holding banners with statements: no false can prevent truth, truth will prevail, Kokknis was true hero, no more dissembled faces, this is land of all faries and so on. But men by the Royals were there to stop them to march towards the palace. Interception from the royal guards was leading situation to riots. Civil war was kindled and for the safety of the Royals, decision makers of palace decided table talk.An old courtier by the Royals came to settle down the issue. But the only demand from protesters side was victory of truth for which Kokknis sacrificed his life and establishment of new democratic government. Just to avoid French revolution or Arab spring ending, the Royals were forced to agree all the conditions. For all the corruptions done by the Royals and for murder of Kokknis, they were forced to face exile for the entire life. Hence in this way a small spark of truth by a common man sparkled the whole situation of revolution just to declare the truth as victorious and to prove the fact that truth could be as small as a seed, but one day it would flourish like a bud to make strong trees with strong roots."
The boy who almost stopped breathing,"Once there was a boy named Aaron. Aaron lived in a mansion with his parents. Mr and Mrs Saunders.They were of high rank in the social society because of their well-paying jobs. Their son, however, turned out to be a rotten and spoilt child. Aaron loved to lie and throw tantrums when things didn't go his way. Everybody knew that Aaron was not to be trusted. At 15, he already had a bad reputation. A troubled young man, people would say. When he was 5-years old, he stole chocolate and a drink from the shop. After being confronted about this by the shop owner, he said there was no food in his home. The shop owner forgave him and let Aaron go.  Aaron only got worse. He lied to his parents, multiple times and also tricked them. Aaron lied about being bullied, his friends and even his teachers. He would say that his teachers gave him beatings and robbed him of his marks. Since his parents were influential, they had all those teachers fired and the children expelled. Aaron pretty much had his way. Poor Mr and Mrs were blind to their son's deceptiveness. They hastily did all Aaron had asked and believed every lie he told.  It was Tuesday morning when Mr Saunders got a call from Aaron's school,""Hello Mr Saunders, this is Ms Mitchel from Fredrick Private school"",""Good morning Ms Mitchel how can I help you, is there a problem?"" he asked.""Yes, Mr there is. Aaron has not completed his homework. He said to me that you did not allow him to and instead said that he should do some tidying up,""""I wanted to confirm if this is true or is it a lie?"" she added.""No no, its a lie Ms Mitchel, yesterday he told me he had no home work,"" he replied.""Alright then, that means Aaron has lied again. Why am I surprised? Of course, he lied!"" Ms Mithchel said in annoyance. ""I apologize Ms Mitchel, I will talk to him and make sure something like this never happens again."" Mr Saunders said.""Sir you always say that, but we still find ourselves in this kind of situation. You need to discipline your child, otherwise he will be the death of you. Goodbye!"" she said and hung up the phone. Mr Saunders became infuriated and told his wife. They decided to lock up his bicycle. They commanded Aaron that from then forward, he was going to walk to school. They also insisted on him that he stopped telling lies so much. As expected, Aaron was unwilling to comply. He wanted to have his way. He began thinking of a new lie to tell tomorrow to avoid walking to school. ""Oh, I know better. No way I'm going to walk to school tomorrow! If I show up without my bicycle then no one will respect me anymore. I don't care what my parents said, I'm going to lie forever. I'm not going to stop breathing suddenly, because of telling lies. That itself is a lie! I'm going to lie whenever I want,"" he thought to himself. Wednesday morning came. It was cold and windy outside. It was also a perfect day to be sick. Being sick is what Aaron was practising to carry out his plan. Little did he know how wrong his day would go. Aaron practices having difficulty breathing. After a few tries, he feels confident in himself and then calls his parents. "" Hello... dad, can you... can you hear me? he said while pretending to gasp for air. ""My chest... chest hurts... I can't breathe!"" Aaron exhausted his chest.His worried father called the ambulance in a hurry. Mr Saunders requested professionals and experienced paramedics. ""Make sure you bring the best of the best of your staff! My son's life is at stake."" he said with worry in his voice. From there on, Mr Saunders contacted Aaron's school and told them the news. The teachers, however, did not believe him. They were aware of Aaron's shenanigans. Although, they did not make this transparent to Mr Saunders.  The ambulance sirens rang loud enough for Aaron to hear. He saw how close they were and began faking his breathing again. The paramedics ran into the house, headed straight to 'sick' Aaron.  ""This boy, he never gets tired, does he?"" said one paramedic.""There's nothing wrong with you, Aaron!"" shouted another.""You knew, didn't you? When will you ever stop lying, young man? This kind of behaviour is apalling,"" said the first paramedic.They were all furious and so they left. Aaron waved goodbye to them with a satisfied smile. His plan turned out perfectly. Or so he thought.  He felt a has head spin right after closing the door. Aaron struggled his way back to the sofa. He held on to anything he could to get there. The counter. The fridge, wall and the bar table. And before he knew it, his heart began pounding as if a drummer was in his chest. He felt difficulty taking in the air, for real. All his faked symptoms had then become true. Feeling drowsy, he looked for the phone again. With his vision being blurry and breathing profusely, he took steps slowly. Aaron managed to plead with the paramedics to come back. Although they were angry, they did not want to ignore him.  The ambulance drove back to the Saunders mansion. Upon arrival, they saw Aaron lying on the floor. With his hand on his chest. His eyes were red, and a few tears were visible on his cheek. One paramedic quickly performed CPR on him. Soon after, he regained his senses. From that day on, Aaron stopped lying. He realized lying is not the solution. The boy promised himself to never lie again, neither to his teachers nor his parents. Can you believe he even became the highest performing learner in his school? Things change.And so, in that way, he gained favour within his community. I guess going through an unfortunate situation made him change his mind. Who knows what he went through in those brief minutes of unconsciousness?"
A Different Point of Shoe,"No doubt, you all know of the Evil Queens magic mirror. I expect youve heard all about the Beasts enchanted rose. And how could you not be painfully aware of the goose that laid the golden eggs? Magic mirrors, enchanted roses and golden eggs. Poison apples, spinning wheels and magic beans. All of these things are familiar features in the stories that you know, every magical item had its place. They delightfully bewitched you and have never relinquished their power over you. What you dont know is, well, everything else. Magic takes more than its fair share of the spotlight. Ill bet you didnt take much time to wonder about the ordinary things in these tales. I thought not.I cant tell you everything you dont know, that would take all the lifetimes you have yet to live. So, on this occasion, I will share you with just one tale. This is a story about a pair of shoes. Cinderellas shoes, to be precise, but not the ones youre thinking of.  Cinderella married the Prince and they lived happily ever after.  Let us continue. Cinderella was swiftly moved into the Princes castle, taking with her what meagre possessions she was able to call her own. Among these possessions were a pair of shoes she had worn almost every single day before the night of that fated ball. They werent particularly remarkable. They were plain and comfortable and the kind of shoes that were made to be worn until they were worn out, then discarded and replaced like last weeks mouldy bread. They had been scuffed by the miles of running around after Cinderellas useless stepsisters and stained with ash of a thousand fireplaces. The soles no longer had any visible tread and a hole was threatening to form through the threadbare toe. These shoes had been good to Cinderella for many years, theyd accompanied her on every thankless chore and had protected her delicate feet with grace and honour. And now, after being absentmindedly scooped up with all the other purposeless belongings, theyd been unceremoniously dumped at the back of a closet, hidden behind the dazzle and shine of Manolos and Louboutins. Forgotten. Time passed by and having endured the heart-breaking sight of Cinderella selecting every other pair of shoes time and time again, the old shoes had lost all hope. They dreamed of a time when they were the ones to be gratefully slipped into each day, until those dreadfully exquisite glass slippers made their appearance. How could they even begin to compete with that? They had been created by the magic of a well-intended, yet slightly thoughtless in this case, Fairy Godmother. Every day, the shoes wished for magic, a miracle or whatever wizardry was possible to conjure, just to find their rightful place inside that shoe closet. Then one ordinary seeming day, the shoes made their way out of the closet. This did not happen through the power of their will alone; they had been dragged out by a particularly mischievous kitten. The kitten had been a gift from the Prince for Cinderellas birthday and it had been given free roam of the castle. It would appear this kitten had a thing for footwear. After succeeding at their retrieval, the kitten stalked the shoes, assessing its catch. It creeped slowly in a circle, keeping its body low to the ground as it prowled, then it pounced on the shoes. It was a playful action from this sweet and innocent little feline but for the shoes it was the last straw. The kittens tiny claws were enough to catch one of the myriad stray threads and with the weakest of tugs, pulled it clean away. The already battered and bruised shoes collapsed at the seams like a broken concertina, with their pieces scattered about the floor. The shelves of leather, satin and suede comrades looked on in horror at their own potential fate if that little kitten decided to hunt them down. In a cruel twist of timing, Cinderella swooped in, picked up her darling new pet and closed the closet doors.Oh dear, what have you been up to? she cooed, surveying the shreds of fabric strewn across the carpet. The kitten mewed innocently in response. Cinderella released the kitten from her embrace and began to pick up the pieces of its latest victim. She held the fabric of the disintegrated shoes between her fingers and was flooded with fond memories of a previous lifetime. She remembered her days as a servant to her ungrateful stepfamily and how it had been the simplest things, like a blanket or a pair of hardy shoes, that had brought just a little bit of comfort. She held those pieces to her heart, thankful for her new life and vowed that those loyal shoes be given the same second chance she had been blessed with. There was much work to be done. Scooping up every last shred and thread, she hurried the pieces down to the Royal Cobbler. He looked at the carnage in her hands with doubtful eyes. You have an entire closetful of shoes, are you sure you want me to bother fixing these tired old things? he asked gently.I want you to do more than just fix them! Cinderella exclaimed. I want you to give them a new life!Well, he began, eyeing the shoes once more, hoping to be inspired. Im no Fairy Godmother but Ill do my best. For three days and three nights, the cobbler stitched and hammered and glued until his fingers were raw. Those who have not been blessed with magic have to work a little harder than most. But the absence of such magic did not stop the cobbler from creating what he believed to be some of his finest work. From the ashes of those worn-out old shoes had risen the brightest of phoenixes that would make even a pair of glass slippers turn emerald with envy. By the time he presented them to Cinderella, they were practically glowing with pride.Oh my goodness! she beamed, throwing her hands to her face. Are they really the same shoes?The cobbler beamed back with his own glow of pride. It was somewhat of a challenge, he told her humbly, but I think I did them justice.He lay them down on a dais to be further adored. Gone was the faded and mould mottled canvas, their fabric cleaned, dyed and adorned. Gone was the flat and treadless sole. In front of them now was a sparkle of flame-red sequins and glitter with the added flourish of a modest Cuban heel. Nobody would be putting these babies in the corner anytime soon.They are so beautiful, Cinderella gushed, a tear escaping delicately down her cheek. I think Id like to try them on.The cobbler helped Cinderella into a chair and she presented him with a single foot as a wave of dj vu washed over her. She remembered this part so well and couldnt wait to experience it all over again. The cobbler gently lifted the shoe to her foot and slipped it on. Well, almost. Hmm, Ill justlet me get the shoe horn. Said the cobbler, leaving to go and rummage around in one of his many cupboards. Cinderella grabbed the shoe and tried wrenching it onto to her foot. She curled her toes and breathed in but no matter how hard she tried, there was no denying it; they didnt fit. Feeling defeated, she held the crimson beauties in her hands and sighed. I can always try adjusting them somehow. The cobbler offered, but Cinderella could hear the doubt in his voice.No, its ok. It must be a sign. Its time to move on and leave the past behind. They deserved a new life but perhaps that life just isnt meant to be with me. She stared wistfully out the window and wondered.."
Anastasia and the Fairy Fakeout,"Once upon a time, (all good fairy tales start with once upon a time, yes?) there was a little girlnamed Anastasia. She went by Ana and was very put out if you called her by her full name (Anastasia Mariposa Jamison) . She was tan , with beautiful, soft, curlystrawberry blonde hair that was more often than not in total disarray. She was 6 years old, 2 feet tall, give or take a few inches, and cuter than a puffed up chickadee. (That, in my opinion is the epitome of cute)She was cute, could be the picture of politeness and decorum, but wasalso brave andtended to be naughty. Very often if sweets went missing before her sister had had a chance at them her Mama knew to look under Anas bed first. She was known to stick her hands into holes in the ground and snatch the inhabitant out, be it a snake, mouse, groundhog or crawdad. She didnt care. She loved them all the same and was not afraid of any of them. Much to her mothers dismay and amusement she was generally garbed in mismatched leggings, skirt, top, hoodie, and sneakers. Nothing matched. It was all a wild array of colors and shapes. She told her Mama she her favorite color was rainbow so she had to always wear her favorite. Except , also to her Mamas dismay and greater amusement, she was usually covered from head to toe in dirt or sand. She never started out that way, of course. Her Mama, though a lenient sort made sure her children always started the day in clean clothes. Mama didnt mind the dirt, as she was an adventurer herself and understood the hazards. She just wished her daughter didnt wear out so many leggings so quickly. Shed refused flatly the request to wear coveralls because in her words there arent enough pockets and they make it hard to move. So that was that. Ana had a doting father, an adoring mother, 3 sisters, one a year older and 2 a year younger (The she was known to utter in disgust. She was not a fan of babies. Babies were anyone younger than her of course very mature 6 years) They all lived in a house on the outskirts of town. A little red brick house that she loved, with a fireplace, and lots of room to run and play. They didnt have loads of money or things but they had enough to eat, clothes to wear, and considered themselves to be doing fairly well for themselves given the state of the kingdom.Ana was in charge of making sure the pets were fed and the cow was milked. After that, she would ask her mama if she could go and play. Usually the answer was yes, with the strict admonition to not wander too far, be back at lunch, and to not, under any circumstances, go near the river. There were boats that had been known to come through, full of soldiers who would think nothing of killing a little girl who got in their way, or taking her for ransom if they were defectors hoping to earn a few coins before they slipped off to the neighboring kingdom in disgrace.Plus there was the very real danger of drowning. Ana knew to stay away but couldnt seem to help herself . On that particular day, Ana completed her chores and asked for the permission she was sure to be granted. However to her disappointment her Mother had said No, today you need to stay home and play with your younger sisters. But MAMA, Ana began to protest. I was going to pick berries for pies! Its the first day of spring and there are usually loads if I get there before the bears do. Please Mama, please! No, her mother repeated. You absolutely may not . There is danger in the woods today Anastasia Mariposa. I do not want you setting so much as one toe into those woods Ana thought about pouting and perhaps throwing a tantrum but she knew all that would earn her was time doing extra chores. So she huffed, shoulder slumped, lower lip puffed out, into the next room and shouted for her sisters to come play with her. They obediently came, as their mama had informed them they would all be playing together that day. None of them wanted to be on the wrong side of Mamas temper. Ana drew them together and said in her bossiest, only a six year old can manage, condescending voice Mama said we are to play together. I want to go to the field and catch weasels. You will be coming with me or I will tell Mama you wet your beds last night .  We did NOT the twins squealed in unison. Quiet! Ana continued. Just do what I say and then we will do what you want. Even tea party? the girls asked, hopeful. (Ana hated tea parties with the passion of the sun and never wanted to play) With that the girls trudged out the door behind Ana who had already bolted out should her mother feel the need to ask questions. The twins, Madeline, and Mariatried to keep up but they soon were far behind Ana, churning their little legs for all they were worth. They forgot where they were supposed to be headed. Madeline turned to her twin and grabbed her hand. Sissy, where do we go? Dunno, Maria replied, and popped her thumb in her mouth. Madeline scowled. Ana was always calling them babies and when Maria did that she looked like a baby. She always goes in the woods to play Said Madeline. Lets go find her there and with that they turned down the dirt road towards the woods. Ana was not very far ahead. She was in the meadow next to the woods, just a few feet away but was crouched down in the grass and wild flowers, elbow deep in a weasel hole. She had forgotten about her little sisters almost as soon as she had left the house and was focused on finding a weasel to show to the neighbor boy Randy because he didnt believe that she could. It was for this reason she was altogether frightened out of her wits when a deep voice asked Where are your sisters? She yanked her arm out of the hole and saw that just a few feet in front of her was a bull moose that seemed practically the size of a house. Ana, unaccustomed to being spoken to by mooses, (moose, meese? She wondered), she was quite at a loss for words. However the question had jarred her memory and she realized she had run off without her sisters. She would be in so much trouble with her mama if she found out about this. Mr. Moose? I dont  how are you t-, I mean. Um. What about my sisters? Do you know where they are? He said slowly, as if she was a little slow. Wellthey were supposed to come with me here. Do you know where they are? As a matter of fact, I do. They fell into the river. They what?! No no no, Mama is going to me. Did you get them out? Are they ok?  They are with the fairies. To be honest they are thinking about keeping them. Keeping them? They cant do that! Have you never heard of the changeling myth? They do it all the time. Furthermore, it appears they werent particularly well taken care of if they ended up all the way in the woods and in the river.I just. I wanted to catch a weasel to take to Randy so hed believe me that I could catch one. And that was more important than your little sisters? No, but  I sorta forgot them. Look, heres the thing. I can make the fairies give them back but it will cost you something. What do you want?  You need to take them a trade. They have agreed for saving your sisters you owe them three things. 100 wildflowers of different colors, 3 fresh chicken eggs, and a newborn puppy. Wait. Thats she did some quick mental calculations 104 things. Look. I didnt make the list Im just conveying the message. You have until noon. And to Anas bewilderment the moose disappeared. She looked up at the sun and could see it was still mid morning. I have time. She whispered to herself and began picking flowers all around her. She gathered them by fistfuls, hoping that they were all different colors. She would count them later. She jammed them into her pockets and ran down the road towards her familys barn. She had already brought in the eggs for the morning but she knew some of the hens liked to lay in strange places. She found 3 eggs in short order. The third thing was the hardest for her to think about. She had just been given a newborn puppy to bottle feed because his mom had rejected him. She was looking forward to keeping him in her bed and watching him grow. Still, she couldnt let her sisters be kept by the fairies. She ran, hands protecting the puppy and eggs jammed in her pockets on top of the flowers. I should have grabbed a bag she thought to herself as she struggled to keep everything with her. As she got to the entrance the woods she remembered her mothers earlier admonition about not going there today. She figured she would need to face the consequences if mama found out about any of this so she kept moving.After a minute or two of walking on the shade darkened path she began to call out Mr. Moose! Mr. Moose! I have the things! And just in time. The moose said as he appeared out of the trees behind her. Come this way and in seconds Ana found herself in a small cave that she had never seen before. Ana! called her sisters in unison. She gently laid down the puppy, eggs, and wildflowers. Then she wrapped her arms around her sisters gratefully.They walked out of the cave and back onto the path. If we run we can be back in time for lunch! she urged her sisters. Lets go. She paused and grabbed them each by a hand and yelled behind her Thank you Mr. Moose Not so fast the moose appeared on the path in front of them. Do you suppose it was as simple as that? You abandoned your sisters, they almost drowned, and you disobeyed your mothers orders to not go into the woods. Are you going to explain yourself? Suddenly Ana felt very small. I cant. She mumbled. I dont know how to explain except I was selfish You were. The moose agreed, and smiled.His huge face split into a huge grin and then was suddenly gone. In his place was her mother . Mama? the girls exclaimed, surprised. Yes. I thought it was time to let you in our family secret. We are magical. We usually get our powers around age 12. But. Do you know the faeries?  No. Well. Not personally. They are born magical, they dont grow into it , so they think theyre better magical folk than us. But nonetheless they arent a part of this. Have you ever wondered how it is you can talk to animals? How they seem drawn to you. This is why they trust you. But this isnt about you growing into your magic either. This is about you obeying your mother. We could have lost your sisters today. Lucky for them, I know you better than you think I do. I guessed that you wouldnt keep track of them and I followed you. Then I told your sisters to wait in the cave over there, and came to find you. But. Then, what were the flowers, eggs, and puppy for? Ana asked, dreading the answer. Well, I knew the girls would want flowers for flower crowns and some to decorate for their tea party. The eggs are to boil so we can have lunch, I brought some other things so we can have a little picnic. Andthe puppy? Well, you shouldnt leave a puppy that small alone for so long dear. He needs his mama. She then produced the tiny puppy and a bottle and handed them both to Ana. They all settled down on a blanket that had appeared in the meadow, Ana staring confused at the puppy in her hands, the twins skipping merrily, in no way confused by the days startling revelations. There werent any fairies she muttered as she looked at her sisters, for the first time grateful to see their matching braids and dresses in front of her. and we are magical. She had a lot to think about. But first, lunch. And then, she realized with sudden realization and dread, a tea party with her sisters. And whatever punishment mama was bound to cook up for breaking the rules."
FIVE BUCKS PROMISE,"FIVE BUCKS PROMISE His head was too big for his body. His big hollow eyes stark and his cheekbones tight against his dusty pale skin. Crouched on the ground covered with yellow dust, this 10-year-old waited for the puppy to crawl out from under the low raised platform of his neighbors home. He smiled as he watched the puppy eat the gravel. How fun it would be to let it fight with the puppies of the other kids on the ground he thought. He was pretty sure his would wallop the daylight out of every other.Looking for dust? Bailey said.He looked up to see Bailey, her hair oiled and braided into two with her distinct fluorescent green bag hanging low on her back. The books must be heavy he thought. Mama! Andy is looking for dust at our house. She picked up a small pebble and threw at him. Andy sprang to his feet and kicked some dust towards her.Dont fight! Baileys mom dragged her into the house.Wait till I get the dog, Andy said, I bet you will not pick on me.Andy crouched down on the ground again and started to snap his fingers towards the dog. Come here! he said to the dog and snapped his finger.Suddenly the signal drum of the Southern side of the city began to echo. Da-dum-da-dum!Andys mother rushes out of their house with too many buckets for her own good. Shrill voices could be heard from all around. The clanking of iron buckets and steel pots sounded too familiar, the melancholy of it all. Andys mother kicked up dust behind her as she rushed along the narrow lane lined with tin walled shelters, some barely hanging to its bamboo poles. A bucket slips out of her hand but she didnt stop rushing. Andy! she looked over her shoulder as she ran, Andy!Andy glanced at the puppy then at his mother. He sprinted at once, his frail body almost falling over from the weight of his head, then picks up the bucket to follow his mother. His mother slowed down on reaching the public hydrant.Only four people. She released a sigh on seeing the wait line.There is dirt and sand in the water again! the lady at the front said.Dont waste time, the hydrant watcher said, the water will stop in 4 hours, many people will start coming.Eh! Will our complaints be even heard? the lady said.Only three buckets today, the watcher said looking at us, everyone has to get water.Andy, his mother handed him a bucket, take this and go home.With a glum face Andy walked home with two iron buckets dangling from each of his hand. A little ahead, the sun above his head shone on a shiny round metal lying on the dusty ground. He looked around to make sure nobody was around before putting the buckets on the ground then rushes towards the piece of metal.Ten bucks! The corner of his lip curled up, he dusted off the coin and rubbed the coin against his palm to feel the coin turn slightly warm.Its real! He chuckled. Later that night his mother offered to keep the money for him, saying he was too young to keep it safe.I am not a kid anymore. He had said to her. Cramped up in between his parents on their small mattress, Andy fidgeted all night with the thought of all the things he could do with the money. Soon after his father had left for work, Andy put on his best cloths; his red shorts with a stained white vest, one too large for him. He rubbed the coin in between his left palm and his right fingers before placing it into the corner of his pocket. Where are you going? his mother said.Something important. He said fixing his hair with some water. Andy, she looked at him pointedly, are you going to the city?No, his spine ran cold, I am notAndy! Tap! He dropped the comb and ran. He rushed through the narrow lane until his mothers frantic shouts faded into the dusty lane.Hello Andy, a kid said when he walked past the ground(playground).Hello. Andy said. Andy looked over his shoulder to watch his friends fight their puppies on the ground. Bailey must be in school, he thought. This dusty ground was the only paradise for the kids who could never dream of sitting in a classroom. In a few moments he was out of the lanes of the dwelling. Then he climbed up the head of nothingness lined all along the dwelling, almost four times as tall as him. The heap had all sorts of things; rotten food and rags, metal boxes, glass beads and concrete bits and things he couldnt quite guess. Once he reached the top, he could finally see the highway. Its been long, he thought to himself. He climbed down the heap of garbage and was now trying to cross the highway to the other side. Getting past the speeding cars and trucks was no easy feat but it was all worth it the moment he reached the market lane, a few minutes walk down the other side of the highway. This was the Northern side of the city. No drums could be heard, only horns. The market lanes were bustling with people dressed in yellows and reds for the festive season. Andy stood right outside a stationary store fumbling in his pockets. He watched as kids walked out with books and crayons. Are you not going in? Someone said.Andy looked beside him to see a young lad dressed in shirts and pants. He thought the man was handsome.What are you buying? the man said. Books. Andy took out his coin and showed it to the man.For yourself?No, Andy put back his coin, for me and my friends.Where are you from? the man tilted his head. From the other side of the road. Andy lifted his head a little. The man looked at him quietly for a moment before he said, Lets go in then.Andy led the way into the stationary and he looked around. On entering the man winked at the lady behind the counter from behind Andy. Noticing the gesture, she nodded with a smile. What do you want to buy? the man leaned towards Andy.I have not decided yet. Andy looked around. He had never been this confused. He thought he could buy in a moment but he dared not. What is your name? the man said.Andy. He looked up to the man and glanced at the counter lady.Hello Andy, my name is Jody.Hello Jody. Well, guess what I have been shopping here for years, Jody said, and I happen to know what is the best they can offer.Um-hm?Yes, Jody nodded, would you like to take my suggestion?After a thought Andy nodded. Jody helped pick out elementary items for him and his friends. When they reached the counter and placed all the stuff, Andy had asked for the price. Five bucks. Jody said after looking at the receipt and winked at the lady behind the counter. Five bucks. The lady smiled and nodded.You can read? Andy said to Jody.Yes, Jody said, I am a teacher.Then would you like to come and teach my friends? Andy said Jody looked at him for a moment and nodded, Sure.How about tomorrow? Andys eyes beamed. Okay.Andy handed the lady his coin and got back his change.Dont worry, Andy handed him five bucks, I will pay you.No, no, Jody said, I will take it when I come.Okay, when you come just ask anyone on the other side of the road , he said, they all know Andy.With the five bucks tucked away in the corner of his pocket, he crossed the road and climbed over the heap with a bounce in his steps. We will go to school tomorrow! he said to his friends on the ground. The kids rejoiced at the news, jumping and screaming. The elders just walk past their fleeting joy. A teacher is coming tomorrow. Andy saidHere? another kid asked. Yes, he promised me. He takes out the five bucks, I promised to pay him.What if he does not come? another kid said.He will, Andy said, Whoever comes tomorrow morning will get books and crayons. He got up earlier than his father that morning. He wore his best clothes again, stood in front of the yellow tinted mirror and combed his hair with water to make it sleek. I am leaving, Andy said.What a day! His father smiled, My son is leaving before me.I have a class. Andy said over his shoulder before he walked down the narrow lane. His mother released a deep sigh and shook her head. Three other kids were already seated at the ground, including his best friend Dey.Good morning. Dey said to Andy. Good morning. Andy said and sat down beside him.With a big smile Andy reaches his tiny hand into the corner of his pocket to feel the coin. Once he was sure it was intact, he removed his hand and flattened his pocket.Someone is coming! Dey sprang to his feet.Someone is approaching! another boy jumped up on his feet to watch the approaching man."
Don't Look Under the Rug,"It was the middle of the night, and Dan couldnt sleep. This was nothing new for him; every night for the last 15 years, his bladder had needled him awake at the witching hourthat time when all the clubbers have gone back home, and the city rests before clambering back to life for another busy morning. It was the one hour every night when New York City was impossibly quiet.He softly sat up and massaged his trembling right hand. He tried to remember the date, but was unsuccessful. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the days had begun to blend together into a monotonous loop. Somewhere along the way, the weeks had turned into months, then years, and finally decades. Now, at age 40, it felt like time was a slow avalanche heading towards him, too big and powerful to escape. All he could do was stand at the bottom of the mountain, watching the snow inch its way down, waiting to be crushed.He stifled a sigh, not wanting to wake up his sleeping wife, Amy. He quickly glanced at her slim shoulder poking out of the blankets, then her blonde hair as it fanned across the pillow. She snored softly like a potbellied pig, deep asleep from a hard days work. Despite the slow press of life, he half-smiled at his wife. Even after all the time hed spent simply surviving, the sight of Amys exposed shoulder sent little flutters through his chest. He felt like he won the lottery because she loved him. She helped him more than shed ever know.He gently put the blanket up over Amys shoulder and stumbled out of bed, no longer drunk, but still buzzing. He slowly shuffled down his tiny hall to the bathroom, his good hand on the wall to guide him through the dark. Once inside, he closed the door, flipped on the light, and pissed out the six Miller Lites and three shots of whiskey he tossed back a few hours earlier. He finished and flashed himself a smirk of satisfaction in the bathroom mirror. His secret was still safe.For the last 15 years, ever since his only child, Toffer was born, Dan would wait until his wife and son both fell asleep, usually around 10:30, and hed slip out the door, careful not to make a sound as he closed it. Once outside, hed fly down the one flight of stairs to his 1970s Oldsmobile Sedan and snatch the six-pack from his trunk hed bought that morning. Hed guzzle down one beer after another, throat open for maximum speed, trained like a Jedi through 1000s of repetitions, all the while staring out into the night, looking at nothing, focusing only on the touch of the beer bubbles tickling his throat and the way his wobbly right hand gradually became steady. Immediately after he finished, hed scamper across the street with the empty six-pack in hand and throw the lifeless bottles in the dumpster, getting rid of the evidence with a content bend of his toes. Then hed rush back up the one flight of stairs, step inside his little apartment, and grab his fifth of Jack from underneath the sofa. Bottle in hand, hed blast back three deep swigs to get himself really spinning. Hed slide the bottle back under the sofa and plop down in his La-Z-Boy staring blankly at the evening news, the spectacle of two Lester Holts swirling around the TV soothing him like the lullabies his mom should have sang to him every night when he was young. Gradually his eyes would grow heavy and hed make his way to the warmth of his wife to get his four hours of shuteye.Dan finished smiling at himself for being the best undercover drunk in New York City and trundled across the hallway to check on Toffer when his foot landed on something squishy underneath the little red rug with a cartoon hen, his wife had bought at a garage sale a few years back. Dan looked down and saw a lump bulging oddly out of the hens face, lifting the battered rug half-a-foot off the ground. He shook his head, What in the world could this be, he mumbled to himself.Curiosity peaked, he bent down and reached underneath. A pencil thin, 10-inch purple tentacle with green suckers latched onto his arm. Dan, alcohol swirling through his blood, assumed it was a toy, perhaps a lifelike octopus Amy had bought Toffer a long time ago that had somehow found its way from the closet into the hall. He lifted his arm up from under the rug with the tentacle still attached and examined the toy.He stumbled back and stared at some type of softball-sized octopus with unblinking dark green eyes that gazed back at him. Suddenly, a voice loud as a bullhorn echoed through his brain, I have put a toxin into your body that stops you from making any noise with your mouth, the octopus-like-thing thought to Dan. You can use telepathy to communicate with me.Dan chuckled, thinking hed somehow miscalculated the amount of Jack Daniels hed drank earlier. He hadnt allowed himself to get drop-your-pants-in-a-bar-and-show-your-penis drunk since before Toffer was born. He delighted at the long-lost feeling and decided to play along. What are you? Dan thought to the octopus as he studied its purple face devoid of nose and ears in the darkened hallway, only the bathroom light casting a slither of illumination along the wall and floor.I am what you humans call an alien. I come from a planet named Stellphase Arena 767 in your language.Dan shook his head and chuckled. Damn. Im drunk as shit, he thought to himself.He lifted his arm up towards his face, right hand trembling slightly harder, and examined the alien. It looked incredibly real. He poked his tongue out to give it a half-drunken lick, but it puffed its body to twice its original size, expanding like a balloon. Its tentacle tightened around Dans arm, and the little suckers dug into his flesh. Dan felt dizzy for a moment and then completely sober.I have pumped a chemical into your bloodstream to remove the alcohol distorting your reactions, the alien shouted into Dans brain. Now stop this foolishness.Dan stumbled backward and grabbed at his throat, gagging, unable to breathe. The thought of an alien in his little apartment pounded inside his brain, taking over everything. He collapsed down onto his knees. Moments later, he felt a cooling sensation flow through him, taking away all his terror. Your response is quite normal, especially for a human as weak as you. I have pumped another chemical into your bloodstream to stop your biochemical reaction of panic, the alien thought into Dans brain.Dan rose back up to his feet, feeling slightly removed, but mostly normal. He locked eyes with the alien, and it was like looking into a can of emerald green paint. The octopuss gaze was detached, unblinking, and he suddenly felt like he was an ant swimming in that can of emerald green paint, trying to escape, knowing itd take everything he had to get out.The tentacle tightened further around Dans arms, the hundreds of suckers jabbing through his skin like needles, and still, they stared each other down, neither blinking. Dan felt his trembling hand grow heavy, then his arm. Still, he couldnt stop glaring into those deep green unblinking eyes, even though he felt like he was drowning, losing the fight inside the can of paint, his head about to dip underneath the surface.Dan heard a crunching sound on his pinkie and felt a slight twinge, but it seemed far away, like in a dream. What do you want from me? Dan thought to the alien.After watching Dan immediately succumb to a panic attack like his commander said he would, the alien held his head high, growing more confident. Im here to eat you, and then I will become a replica of you.Dan felt another crunch on his hand, still off in the distance. How are you gonna eat me? Youre so small? Dan asked.Here is how this works, human. I am pumping a pain blocker and blood coagulant, along with the panic removing chemicals, into your arm through the suckers on my tentacle, the alien thought to Dan. If you try to remove me from your arm, Ill stop giving you the pain blocker, blood coagulant, and the panic removing chemicals. Your hand will start bleeding profusely, the pain will be unbearable, and youll start to panic again.Why would I feel pain and bleed?Ive already bitten off two of your fingers. My body needs ten minutes to process them, then Ill start to grow, and Ill continue to eat the rest of your hand?The aliens drugs continued to flow through Dan. He felt no pain or fear, only confusion. Why me? he asked.Because you are pathetic. Youre a middle-aged assistant manager at McDonalds who has no friends. And you never even talk to your parents or grandparents. Your wife and son love you, but you never try to give them a better life. Instead, you come home every night to this little apartment and get drunk by yourself before you pass out and wake up a few hours later at 4:00 in the morning to relieve your bladder. And then you always walk down this little hall over this little rug to check on your son whos always sleeping in bed. My commander calculated that all-in-all, you are one of the easiest targets in all of New York City. You are easy prey for me while Im in this enfeebled state.Dans mouth creaked up into a grin, and then he shot the alien the biggest, brightest smile hed ever managed in his life.Why are you leering at me like that human?I know why your commander picked me. He saw that Im a middle-aged assistant manager who hates his job and doesnt even know what day it is. And yeah hes right. I do get drunk every night by myself, no friends to comfort me. And your little commander saw my thinning hair, and the black bags under my eyes, and my potbelly. And he put everything together and thought, Im a soft pile of shit. But theres one thing your commander doesnt know about me. You see, my dad was a mean alcoholic, and after my mom had had enough of his temper and left, he turned his anger towards me. He beat the shit out of me every night. And Im not talking a few slaps to the face. No, my dad used to break bones. So, you see, for a guy like me, a guy who went through the shit I went through growing up, this life I have is a victory. Its a fucking miracle that Im merely an alcoholic who hates his job and has no friends when I should be living on the street, getting drunk in front of a trashcan fire every night. What I got here in this little rented two-bedroom apartment with my wife and son, is like Bill Gatess life for a guy like me. And let me tell you something else, those two fingers you chewed off, my dad broke those fingers twice when I was growing up, so I aint scared of a little pain and blood.Dan lifted his right arm above his head and smiled again. He was sober, yet his hand was steady, firm like a rock. You fucked up, Dan thought to the alien before he slammed it on the ground.The alien exploded with a satisfying thud into a ball of emerald green goo."
Jadie the lonely soul,"As night rise coldness indulge itself into the murk making itthicker and harder to breathe but at least not for Jadie who had already survived in the fierce dilemma of this world with a spear ripping her heart she will always continue her journey until the every drop of her blood will drain out of her scars but which journey? what sort of avenue? as soon as she had decided to become wayfarer of herparents mended path she had found herself lost. The footprints she was following faded away as the shoulderssupporting her were no more there. those lips always curled into a sonorous smile that ignited jewels into her heart was just an arc, those mangatas entangled in their eyes wereno more there , just vacant blueish yellow eyeballs, those warm calloused hands always ready to hold hers were cold and Gray when she last saw her beloved ones.how can she forget the look on the corpses face.even though she knew they know more existed a teeny bit of fragment in empty vessel of her soul hoped to see them again and that hope had dragged her to sneak out of orphanage in the dead of night.Her limbs numb with cold and fear making her wonder will they even cooperate for a few more seconds. she was on the ground now, lack of energy had made her crawl like a writhing centipede with no legs, her ears could hear the distant hauls of wolves jamming blood in her veins. she looked back and forth with a little hopefluttering in her eyes. indignation rose letting the tears behind the bars to trickle down her cheeks desperate for abrush of hands she once used to get. after all that struggle she dropped her head down waiting for death to come, not even flinching as the blades of grass cut her skin and crawling bodies Nestled in her hair.she could smell the love , feel the smooth texture of cherry blossoms as her father will hand her because of her will and his desire to see her young daughter overwhelmed with felicity.Her vision went dark and she got lost in the maze of her brain. she was losing track of time and that frustration made her open up her Oceanic blue eyes again. she had never been able to see the night Sky before what a wasteof life!! crystal clear dark, prominent treetops and smooth glassy black Sky holding up millions of galaxies, stars and moon perched on clouds even with their negligible size twinkling stars proved their existence not by becoming an empty whole but by scattering their light into the dark, illuminating their selves from the moon. Stars masterfully curved into magnificent constellations leaving her stunned.  these starsreflected the same light the ones sparkling from my Mama Papas eyesshe muttered under her breath.she stood up and headed to the graves. one step more she told herself and dropped on the wet mud of their graves and All in all the tears she was holding back rushed down and she fell asleep drawn back to her memories, feeling as though she was curled on her mamaslap gibberingdoyou even know how much I missed you..The world looked prettier than it ever did and Jadid could not save herself from drowning in kalopsi.

He asked her pointing behind her where? but herquestion dissolved into thin air when she saw a dozen, hundred thousands of souls lurking in the dark, shadowing over their own graves. can you see them. They are striving really hard to come back, trying to forget the regret of wasting their life. what would you prefer dear a whole vast world towander or a luxurious building?do you have any regrets too daddy? not dear because I have made you smile but I will if you wont cherish your lifeits OK dad.I will she muttered wiping tears off his cheeks and she hugged both of them tightly.

I was wrong with requesting people for coup de grace regarding me."
The Stoicism of an Unrequited Love,"Christopher Lark was devastated, wrecked, ruined and bold enough to share this with all of his friends who hadnt asked. He learnt from the university lectures that as far as you accept the relativity of the adjective bad in relation to things that happen in life, you are going to achieve apeace of mind and be satisfied for the rest of your days. He wondered whether Marcus Aurelius would have said agirls no could be called relative.Miss Gloria Hancock was called achild of the stars and she indeed seemed to have aclose relationship with them, as she had decided to choose aman who could buy them for her over the one talking about love and other impractical things. And so there he was, refused lover, throwing another cigarette into the depths of the canal full of still water, trying to be cynical and pathetically failing.Could another cigarette be found in that miraculous pocket of yours?the voice of potential listener boomed across the night, drawing young Werther from his dark thoughts. When the first attempts of confiding were waved off with merry and careless : Oh Ido not want to deprive you of the extremely attractive aura of unsolved troubles, just felt like smoking., Chris acknowledged the tall, ginger youth, winking at him patronizingly is not the right willow to weep at.They stood quietly next to each other for as long as it takes to start feeling uncomfortable, when desperate Chris stated gravely: I needed amentor to guide me through arough patch of life and universe said no.I bet he isnt the only one, is he? no wicked smile had been so close to the destruction than the one of the red-head strainger.I have seen too many sad faces and heard too many moving sighs not to recognise abroken-hearted fellow wanderer to the grave,was aresponse to the startled and ashamed look, I live down there, you know? In the canal.Chris, in the state of mind in which we tend to smile weakly: Oh, of course you do., absently stuttered: The people of your appearance are called kissed by fire, not water.And you are kissed by no one, as far as Ican tell, impatiently cried the water spirit, because thats what he really was, careless, arrogant water creature, trying to be helpful for no nobler reason than the intolerable boredom.How dare you lecture me about love? hissed the offended sufferer, you inhabit the muddy bottom, mind your own cods and plankton!I am going to pretend Ihavent witnessed the poor manners of yours. Do you fancy spending the rest of your life in regret, thinking about the impossibility of the possibility or will you let me help alittle and show you the way, Romeo?Christopher hasitated, hypnotised the glittering water surface ornamented by the tender tears of the new moon, tried to remember whether he had went for a drink or not and when he finally persuaded himself it would do no harm to befriend a potential illusion, he shaked the offered hand.His companion seemed very pleased with this gesture and said more amiably: ""We should not reach for stars, unless we are ready to get burned by their cold light. Save the flame for someone who can spark off.""Christopher wanted to oppose by stating there can't be much he knows about fire, but was suprised by the sudden wave of sympathy overflowing him, provoked by the boy's unconventional behaviour and rough kindness. The familiar drops of the undiluted light in the corner of the piercingly blue eyes made him wonder whether they had met before. The earthy smell of upcoming rain brought the memories of the day on which his mother passed away, getting lost in the suffocatingly tragical list of incomprehensible latin names composed by their family practitioner. He saw himself, too young and too vulnerable, escaping from the sobs and deafening sound of death to the garden behind the house, trying to save the pieces of the shattered little world paralyzed by the understanding of truths that should be hidden from the sight of the little, only to be revealed when they are tried by life and deprived of the fragility.""It was unbelievably poetical, that day. Even the weather wanted to pay a tribute to the departing Being,"" muttered Dion who, in spite of being the essence of the water or as a result of it, had his own name. When he met the startled eyes of Christopher he shrugged his shoulders reluctantly.The drops pouring down the cold cheeks in the fleeting embrace of the storm. He had been there. He had been there all the time. Older as the names of things and infrangibly young. Full of vices, now again offering a helping hand. How could I forget?Moved Christopher took a deep breath and smiled shakily. He had no intention to bring up things he was so grateful for, forcing his companion to blush and restore his cool, reserved posture.""Let's get down to work, shall we?"" he asked, still emotional and trying very hard to hide it....There are days in life when we are ready to forgive all the unjust insults, put on the uncomfortable festive clothesand smile at the people we do not particularly like. The wedding day might and might not be one of them, but for Christopher Lark and Melanie Meadows it certainly was.Icould tell you about the shy young gentleman becoming ahero after saving even more shy young lady from the treaturous waters of the city canal, about her confused assuring that she had felt the hand pulling her before she lost the balance, which made all the onlookers laugh or the meetings, shivering eyelashes, glowing faces, jewels on fingers, kisses and proposals, but newly-wed couples have the ultimate right to have secrets and Iwill only say, that before he kissed his pretty bride, Christopher had heard the quiet clattering of the rain drops and smiled for himself. He wouldnt miss it for the world, he thought, remembering an old, rather unusual friend, who suceeded in making even the stoicism of an unrequited love agreeable."
A New Place,"The honeyed early-morning sun glinted off the lapping waters like a thousand tiny jewels. Birds sang in the June air, small voices lilting in a soothing natural orchestra. Past the waterside reeds, the fronds of tall palms whispered in a light breeze. Puffy cotton candy-colored clouds drifted across the pale blue sky, in no rush. Fisher birds, early to the hunt, dove and splashed into the sunlight-speckled water, and swooped back into the air with their quarry wriggling in their beaks. A few gulls rode the gentle waves, only to take to the air shrieking as a hand emerged from the blue water in a shower of droplets.A woman, to whom the hand belonged, surfaced, and gasped her very first breath of true oxygen. The breeze stung her opalescent skin; the sun pierced her pale silver eyes. She moved her arm to shield her eyes, and saw her skin in daylight for the first time. Translucent, scaled as a fish. Blue veins ran patterns in the hollow of her wrist. She twisted her arm this way and that, watching the colors in her skin change. The burn of the bright light ebbed, and she could see clearly.The creature let out a burbling call, and it sounded strange to her own ears. Life underwater. Never before had she heard her own voice so loud and clear.Something called in return, and the creature turned toward the source of the noise. The sand rose up into a mound of /land/, an island, dotted with tall, spindly things that erupted in green fronds at their tops. Small, flying things, like fish, flitted from these fronds. They chirped, as the creature did. She knew their name from whale song. Birds.The sand bubbled around her toes as the creature struck out for the island. The beach sloped upward, drawing her out of the water, until the brilliant gold sun was warming her back. Water streamed down from her hair. Her feet sank into the foamy sand as she stepped from the ocean. More bird calls sounded, and she answered enthusiastically.This island was alive. Land-native plants stretched from one end of the beach to the other. Birds fluttered to a fro among the fronds overheard. A green thing the size of a tuna fish with a long, snakelike tail and a scaly beard, meandered lazily from a bush and passed by the creature, walking on strange five-toed feet with the toes facing two different directions. It watched her with tiny eyes that also reminded her of tuna. Then it wandered off.Excitement budded in the creature's chest. She followed the green quadruped for a time, admiring its zig-zagging gait, watching its long, tapering tail score furrows into the sand as it wriggled its skinny body along on its short legs.Before long, a crab scuttled between the creature and the object of her attention. She eyed the crustacean as it slipped down the beach to where the sand was still being wet by the surf. She'd seen crabs, down on the seabed. This one only interested her because of the way the climbing sun turned its pale yellow shell to orange flame. This new place was so alive with color.A bird's frantic flapping and crying turned the creature's head. At the base of one of the land plants laid a small mass of browned fronds, woven tightly together. Moving steadily, the creature stepped over to the thing and moved it with her hand. She turned it over, the rough texture poking her delicate fingers. It was concave and round. Soft tufts, presumably the bird's, poked from different angles in the recesses of the creation. Bits of eggshell stuck from the woven pieces as well, and the nest was sticky with yellow ooze.Panicked shrieks forewarned the creature of the sharp jabs that pounded into her head with vehemence. Startled, she dropped the bird's home, and held up her arms to shield her face from its righteous fury. She called an apology, recoiling from the stinging in her arms and head. She fell back, her body connecting abruptly with the sand, and wished the bird would go away.The assailing stopped. The creature moved her hands and checked for the bird. It had vanished, shrieking, into the air. She looked on her arms, striped and dotted with pink and red, and her stomach turned. She shouldn't have touched the bird's home. She wished she hadn't.Unsteadily, the creature pushed herself to her feet. The sand had begun to shimmer and burn on her skin. This new place had seemed so magnificent at first, too.Back down the beach, the brilliant blue of the sea appeared, incredibly inviting. To go back and have no more angry birds striking her head and arms, no sand nor sun scalding her sensitive flesh. The idea had its merits.But this island was large, and her misfortunes exploring had been few. Perhaps she'd see more wonderful things, more scaled quadrupeds or more forgiving birds.The creature pressed on, drawn into the lush foliage beyond the edges of the beach. The plants that tickled her skin as she walked by were soft, and swayed gently behind her. Gulls cried from the blueness up above, gliding smoothly towards the waves, to feast on the fish coming into the shallows. Nearby, clinging to the rough skin of one of the skinny fern-like plants, a watery green animal barely longer than her little finger rested. It, like the green being from earlier, was extremely akin to a snake. And yet, very much different.When she stretched out her hand, the other creature darted out of sight. She breathed it a soft farewell, even as she searched the brown limb before her for its enchanting little shape. The fronds overhead swayed, scattering sunlight across the bounteous ferns around her in a silent rhythm.Pure oxygen even smelled different than the sea. The scent of earth and dry rock, animals of countless kinds, the skybirds, and the plants themselves all together emitted a strong and yet lovely perfume that tickled the creature's delicate nostrils.The sun traversed the sky, inching steadily toward gargantuan black rocks that jutted upward, hulking and wondrous.As the creature continued her adventure, she kept her pearl-like eyes wide open, all the better to miss nothing.Ever more land animals moved about in the world around her, calling and cawing and crying in a harmonious push-and-pull melody that only ever grew louder. The tall, wood-bodied plants surrounded her, so the song was all her ears knew. The only beast not joining the symphony was a gray-and-brown dappled turtle, which had thick, sturdy legs instead of flippers, and shambled across her path without hurry. The creature touched the rough shell where a snail had made a gleaming path of mucus in the thin dry layer of earth that covered the turtle. The snail trail wove a dizzying pattern on the already-complex markings of the beast's home. The creature followed the design with her eyes until the ferns swallowed the turtle once more.Still further into this place, the creature plunged. The land sloped in places and erupted in places. Earth and rock were interspersed. The lush ferns that were so soft on her toes, at times, gave way to sharp stones that sent ringing pain up through the flesh of her feet. She peered up a steep rock face, unforgiving dark silver stone that reached so high she couldn't even make out its peak. Nothing lived on this cliff but white birds that sounded their calls and swooped in deliberate arcs from one crack in the stone to the next.The creature turned from the cliffs and the sharpness of the ground back into the soothing green shade of the jungle, where once again soft moss and ferns made walking so much more pleasant.An unfamiliar noise drew her attention aloft. A beast draped in thick, algae-like red hair, rested its short-bodied form on a vine-swathed limb. It made the noise again, watching her with small, twinkling eyes. It itched its hairy round belly with one of its long arms. The creature peeled back its fleshy lips and showed to her a row of teeth, yellow and long, flat but for two pointed fangs. The creature stretched her own lips and returned the gesture. The animal above bellowed and scrambled from its perch, alighting on a different wood plant further along, chattering jovially.The creature moved to follow its path, but her toes caught something rough and sent it clattering. She turned her eyes to the source of the fuss and her breath caught. A bizarre-looking skeleton, firm and dark gray, lay in a misshapen heap in the midst of a fern bed. The ribs were wide and flat, some broken off, leaving jagged edges. There were the moss-riddled bones of what must be a hand, not so different from the shape of her own, half-covered by earth. The creature examined this sight, feeling along her own ribs, visualizing the bones in her hands as she turned them back and forth before her face. It was the skull, though, lightly whitened, perhaps by the sun, that intrigued her most. It was jawless, and rested just above the ribs. The creature moved closer and eyed it, tracing her teeth through her skin. Her cheeks. Her brow. She compared it to the skull on the ground. A pang of sadness caused her to frown. This creature may have been like her. At the very least, it must have looked like her. And here it was, long dead, unremembered, not far from the sea.She tore some greenery from one of the plants and laid these gently across the eye hollows of the fallen beast. She burbled a brief tribute, and then she got to her feet, and turned herself back toward her ocean home.By the time her feet met the sand once more, the birdsong had faded. Turning her face to the broad blue sky, she found that it was no longer blue. It had exploded into a startling, almost violent cascade of flaming orange and violet and even green. The sun vanished beyond the distant cliffs, and before long the colors followed it into a pale blue, leaving behind tiny dots of brilliant white lights.The creature followed the trail of the dots until she was staring straight up in dumbstruck wonder. Innumerable, pristine, glittering miniature suns, like countless jewels, lit the sky from horizon to horizon. The world around her, this strange, melancholy, magnificent place, sat in a breathtaking deep indigo hue, unlike anything she'd ever seen.After a time, she tore herself from the starlight and slipped back down the sand until her toes squished once again into the wet surf. The water met her ankles and then her knees, familiar and chilly. The sky went on forever over the black waves. As the creature sunk below the surface, she took in the sight of the bright lights above scattered across the surface of the water in neverending motion, and imagined carrying them into the depths with her."
The Untold Secret; Truth About You,"I really like this guy, when stopped and spoke to me, it told me a story of that I'm sure.I really want him badly, the distance is never ending, why do I wait without for so long, and never really could understand how I did it.I never spoke of him, I truly felt I needed too, I would cross the seas just to hear his voice.For this gift, I am truly pleased, at the sight of his angelic figure. This momentum could be shared forevermore and with dignity for him.He is greatly free in the shiny waves of glory.He is astonishing when he takes a breath of air, it passes through his lungs, his name of so many meanings. When his laughter implores the asylum of the whimsical sea, that feeling grows tiring, that tree above me on the cliff begins to grow dark. His words whispered sweet lullabies to me in the evening of daylight, lingering around many flowers, as the sunset burdens the hurried burnt berries.He couldn't always stand being alone without me, his fingers touch his board, floating to the surface. We shouldn't speak a word to each other from then on. If you'd rather take me as I am, then have me as I was, I am lost and afraid of in those thin moments of life. Capturing the waves, closing in at the shore, closed like a blanket of water weighing in.I rarely say a word about him anymore, I don't consider it a dream at all, because he's drowned in the storm. I couldn't bare the pain, The thought of losing him that day, caused me costly problems with myself.The mourn in the winters craving, as the sun froze into his mystical eyelashes, dripping of almost snow. The memories are indulging as the porch light is disappearing, just as the sun on the horizon were fading, in plentiful colors. The walk felt endless, as the talks were, and I suppose they just start to clothe.The clock on table is ticking like a singing mockingbird, at this point I am unstable like a battle with the neighborhood, is ongoing and I'm dying to know how they all got here. I should have been more sincere while I were getting ready in the shower for an evening dinner. What is more moving than having to meet someone that I barley know at a graduation party Saturday night. I have twenty minutes before I am late, I better prepare earlier next time, soothing my neck gently. By noon, I fell to my knees, as his the whole entire day were forgotten about.Letters written were long lost and forgotten.Freedom is just another word, well I have nothing more to lose, nothingness and you and me staying on this beach.This beautiful beach with a loving stranger, someone who knows me, and loved me for me. This beautiful household we bought together, makes nothing feel better or everlasting, even the peaches are turning my tastebuds rotten. This beautiful place in the hands of a woman who really loved a man.In the arms of a man whose sudden grace fell to the bottom of the ocean. Moreover nothing could compare to him, our relationship reflected doubtfulness, and some mistakes were made. I can recall a few of them, one being that I may have had my hands full, the other day, we'd fought over how much-needed the lawn of trimming. There were so much work to be done in the yard, I shared my responsibilities with him, that it wasn't mine. I should have never brought this up; but it isn't like I knew where it was going to lead. So, today, I let the daylight set the night in mood.Warm as the stars are tonight, they are bittersweet and poisoning as the summers eve, that day he crashed into the sea.A lady and her fellow companion, alone on a beach astray, without a telling time.(A free will standing in the light of darkness)A true love will be there to support me in so many ways, though I knew for fact that I could never look back at this day again, I know I move on and find someone new.There are so many stars in the sky that if I'd try and count them all tonight, I would be breathing fire, shutting the sunlight out for tomorrow. There are so many fish in this sea, out of them all, I never loved someone as much as him. I miss him as much as my mother.There is nothing more wonderful than a mother. There is nothing stronger than a father. There is nothing wider than these ocean's, that sail forgotten for miles, and hold the mysteries of the great big sea. There is nothing more snuggling than to hear the cliffs through the seashells. If someway I could just bare once more the thought of him. If there is someone who is chosen out there for me, it would be here, right now, on this island. Someone else will be all I need to get me through. Life is nothing more than a sky filled with clouds, that roll by to praise, and pass to night to give tomorrow a new day. A change to my life is a challenge yet a chance worth taking. I want to fall in love, I want to be the one who sits by the tallest flower in the fields, I want to grow as old as the rose bushes in his garden's. I think I could fall in love again, if I say that I am happy when I'm not, most of all I'd be lying. I could find a way, a way that will show me through his garden, a way that will get me back to him. I know that happiness is what I've found. I'm fond of this temptation that is hiding behind my back. I am in front of him, holding his hand, making a way for love. I know that there is just one thing that controls the both of us from letting go. That's: the sky full of stars."
Sand and Stardust,"The waves crested before him - a magnificent glittering crown of blues and greys, as well as all the colours that came in between. The sea made hardly a splash as, with a deliberate flick of the wrist spurred on by a stray thought crossing his mind, he directed the lapping, hungry water back into the sandy, grit-wrought shores of the alcove.A weary sigh stole the breath away from his lungs and for a moment, he indulged in simply letting himself be. The sun above was muffled, and the sharp cries of the parks and sea-birds were one of the few sounds to be heard in sharp focus around the deserted lay of these parts.Although he supposed that he was not actually alone.The breeze bristled as if it had plucked those mournful thoughts from his head, and between one breath to the next, it picked up speed, buffeting through the great expanse of the Atlantic. It wove and cut through the stillness around, before surrounding him in a gentle vortex.Like an eager pup, the North Wind peppered his face with kisses of greeting and in response, he tilted his head in resignation, satisfied to submit for now.Hello, old friend. He murmured, nuzzling the tough cut of his beard into the frosty morning chill. Its been far too long, hmm?A chirp of agreement whistled into the hollow of his ears. He chuckled, burdening lightening as he did so. A weight wrapped itself around the curl of his shoulders, nuzzling in, and the barest impression of creature filled the narrow edges of his vision. He closed his eyes, and breathed, content.He felt the elongated wily form of the sky deity change - an ever-shifting mass of celestial feathers and scales, hair and fur and the pink wrinkled skin of a newborn child. Talons pierced against skin, fangs nestled itself against the faint beating of his jugular. A soft pink tongue - forked and smooth and rough - licked a faint stripe against the underside of his throat.He took it for what it was - a comfort. It was a reminder of a well-meaning threat, a platitude and an apology.Thank you. He whispered tearfully against the feathery body. Instinct and habit had him cupping his hands into position and like clockwork, the younger god melted into the cusp of his grasp. A shrill cry of a petrel sliced through the air, and the wind took flight from the calloused palms of his hand.He watched it go, feeling curiously sentimental as he watched it go.Goodbye indeed. He murmured. A single feather lay delicately on the sand strip, and reaching over, he picked it up. He hesitated only for the slightest moment, before tucking it away from view. Subtlety was an unfortunately necessary evil, especially around these unforgiving parts.Power often meant downfall. He was no fool, and he knew better than to be overconfident for it. After all, there are still many creatures of the night out there that still crave and hunger for dominion, and it would be most unwise to flaunt around this latest development.He glanced up into the sky.It felt inadequate that all he could do was give the barest hints of gratitude. Alas, it couldnt be helped, he supposed. It was safer this way, for both of them.For a moment, he worried that perhaps, he had been too impulsive. He had sought this place out as a means of solace. Every fibre of his being yearned for a temporary ceasefire. He was not so naive as to believe in the ideals of peace, but he was not a doomsayer either. There was a place - in between - where there could simply be rest.Time had made him melancholic in its passing. A hundred years would pass in the blink of an eye, and a thousand more in another.One day for himself didnt seem that much of a selfish price.Hesphariux took a single step, then faltered. A frown crossed his face, as an odd twinge plucked at the chords of his beating heart. A slow hum vibrated through his mind in an ethereal choir, and it took him barely a second to realise what it meant. Relief flooded his senses, and unconsciously, he let himself relax completely for the first time since ages.The choir of drumbeats and rivers echoed inside of him, matching every beat of his heart as if it were one. A bright explosion of intangible colours and tastes burst forth in the back of his tongue.He savoured it.The air in front of him shimmered with glossy reverence as the veil dividing the metaphysical from the physical planes split with a quiet tear. The fiery gossamer threads of the hand-weave was brushed aside gently a moment later, and a soft thump from the shores ahead heralded the arrival of a young teen with electrical green eyes and raven-hair.Ooh, The teen - Aesclysius - teased, eyes deliberately glancing at the salt-encrusted trident clutched in his right hand. Devils still got some bite in him. There was a beat, before he flung out out his arms dramatically. Well? He asked, grinning from ear to ear. Did you miss me?The witty remark about unnecessary flairs dried up at the back of his throat. Yes. Hesphariux said simply, not trusting himself to speak over that.Aesclysiuss eyes softened at that. Old sap. He said fondly, already lumbering forward and pulling him impulsively into an embrace. The contact was familiar, and he leans into the offered warmth.A beat passed, before the other god pulled back, hands still clasped on his own shoulders. Missed you too, buddy.Hesphariux could not help but note that Aesclysiuss age was not betrayed through the windows of his eyes, nor did it burst at the seams of his mortal body. Already, that was an achievement beyond many others, especially the younger, newer gods. Even the older and more powerful ones had a tough time struggling with it as well, and similarly, he himself was not exempt from it.As with most cases, it appeared that his closest friend was the exception, rather than the rule. Contrary just so, and a breath of fresh air in an otherwise dying pantheon. This backfires at times though.Like now, because just when he thinks that their relationship over the years has mellowed enough to hold pleasant conversation, Aesclysius goes back to proving him wrong. Curved barbs and teasing remarks that make him scramble his mind furiously to reply in a sufficient amount of time span so as to retain the remaining scraps of dignity that he still possesses.But that was another quirk of his friend. Aesclysius has a way of burrowing under defenses and coaxing out the best and worst of him.Hesphariux has no choice but to sigh, falling back into that incorrigible state of annoyed pleasure. The banter was familiar territory, and the evening spent even more so, because like clockwork, they both found it so temptingly easy to revert back to that behaviour and left-over scraps of personality from when they had been fledgelings.He remembered being free to run around and tussle with the mightier beasts of the lower realms of earth. He remembered shaping the stars together - palms sticky from stardust and energy clasped as one  - as the sprawling landscape beneath shivered with each new pulse of raw creation.It all seemed like an eternity ago - and that is an accurate measure of time, given how long he himself had roamed the world.Sentimentality has him subdued. He quiets for a little while, content to memorise every aspect of his dearest friend. He knows that Aesclysius is doing the same in that moment. As always, they are each others mirrors.Intense jade eyes take in the paler sheen of his own face and the fire-touched strands of hair, while he in return absorbs in the freckled features and rumpled clothing.Its intimate, in a way that physicality could never quite mimic.They barely notice when the sun dips into night, and the creations that they themselves had finger-painted so long ago as fledglings began to fill the iridescent sky. The world around them pales in contrast to the presence of each other, and Hesphariux much prefers it that way.He breathes. Their breaths mingle.The stars were particularly lovely that night."
The Exact Recount of Half a Story,"On the morning of a day not so particular, Z woke up with not just a glee, nor just any variety of contentment that made him doubt himself whether or not he deserved it, but an unadulterated happiness. Something that some indeterminate time ago, Z never thought was possible.In truth, Z had always been apathetic towards technology, quite strangely so, because he worked so closely with all the useful features and convenience such technological advances provided and when one chanced to ask Z, all he would say was that he made a stupid promise to someone a long time ago, to whom he could not even really remember: that everything that he could see, he could quantify without the help of a equipment.As time passed and Z learned his limitations, as all reasonable persons would when faced with reality. However, the promise he made naively and thoughtlessly sometimes he kept himself to its venerable standard. And that had helped him in many of the endeavors when learning the truth about the power of numbers and of things in variables.A stubbornness that was fairly attributed to his idiosyncratic worldview that was neither here nor there, but he rationalized it well inward and ordinate with extremely sound personal rhymes and reasons: Digging deep and one would always find someones downfall due to technological mishaps, and that was just statistically sound; and Z would be damned if he let himself be another set of numbers he might have to look at. That would just be a shameful irony an esteemed economist could not outlive.Sometimes Z would just claim that there was something cold and mysterious about the properties of technology, and might not as quantifiable as they should have been by any measures and standards. Z had found himself aligning with the view that technological advances, materialistic or otherwise, were just mere generative chockfull of prideful numbers and algorithms, and it was just how the world worked when one really wanted to get to the bottom of it. And that was no way to treat numbers. Such disrespect!And when his best friend asked him whether or not Z believed in a higher power, Z said he knew that he could not possibly trifle or concern himselfsuch a complex concept, however simple discourse had it that it would be very hard for him to believe there was one, if any entity, that was more highly ordered than the existence of mere numbers, but that answer had never satisfied anyone asking and listening for something more profound, maybe not even Z himself.Zs friend told him that there was a new quantifiable way for Z to see things, and it was about to hit the open market. He and Jane, his beloved wife, had early access to the Homer, a type of sleep regulator device. They both had some stakes in the company that produced it, and they would really like Zs comments on it.Its still in beta mode. His friend said casually. We have selected thousands of applicants for the first rolling-out model, and a lot of the reviews are great. I cant wait for you to try it.Z had always consciously convinced of himself realizing bigger and better things coming along his path, but thanks to his own revelations, relying on primordial instincts and possibly intuitiveness, not a piece of technology, because in his analytical data, contributions of technology had inferred a great number of malevolence that couldnt be accounted for in many researches, and as an eager and keen study, Z had found such facts to be simple truism.It records brainwaves throughout your REM sleep and translate it into recognizable forms of information and store it. You can play the dream you had for your next sleep as many times as you want. It saves automatically everything you experience viscerally too. It is quite a beautiful piece of technology. His friend said, extolling the virtues of the future of ultimate catharsis and psychotherapy, which Z thought was quite a claim his friend had made, however, it would have no bearings on Zs mind. Why would Z want something meddle about with his brain chemistry by the sound of it? And his cynicism grew partly because of how he viewed clichd shticks that bore practically no real world meaning such as psychological tropes used to group helpless people into an even more pathetic bunch.Z realized that it was harsh criticism on his part, and maybe he desperately wanted to, otherwise, hed be wrong, and that was no where good to go.Do you think that when anyone uses technology for any kind of help at all, it is somehow an admittance of weakness or vulnerability? His friend asked, with his face grimaced with real ponder. I think itll change your life, for better or worse. Try it on Z, and I wont take no for an answer.Z promised to at least try the Homer once, because according to his arbitrary rules, promises should be kept. After all, he kept a promise with one person before, badly he might add, so why not now?At the end of a work week not long after, Z had convinced himself long enough throughout that day to finally get into it. He took a shower, brushed his teeth, gulped his melatonin pills, and put the device on top of his head like a virtual reality machine but more well built and more comfortable. Drowsiness seeped in and effervesced with ease, and he realized that he was lucid in this dream.Everything was just as the brochure from the product claimed it to be. The interface was beautiful, the heightening of his senses, even more visceral than when he was awake he thought. Every sensory debut was more impressive one after another, but it was just introductory courses. For a more lucid experience, Z had to pay a walloping 1,299.99 Karlups to completely immerse himself with its swaths of features, including a total control of his surroundings, subjects, and objects, if he ever got to dream up his ideal dream. Luck! Another unbearable concept that encompassed the technological advances, for all Z knew.After he agreed to the terms and conditions of the payment, there was an instant moment of decidedly updates on his surroundings. Seemingly, the Homer had searched his memories, photos, social media presence, and the many searches from his search engine as it stated in its terms in order to create his ultimate background, from where Z could explore the derivative contents of his own dreams.He recognized the setting right away. It was definitely the night of his school trip in middle school, when he made his first promise to someone, and he now remembered who it was. X was there with him, and the two of them were lying next to each other under the cover of the stars, green blades of grass under them, and they were hand in hand, intertwined at the mouths. Reliving such a memory had reminded him of the silly promise he made. Of course it was with a girl he loved, Z thought. How could he have forgotten O? Maybe the years had rendered him impervious to moments of pure ecstatic innocence, or whatever that feeling was, something he thought he could never experience again.And then they started talking, but the dialogues were intelligible and quickly passed by with Z and O falling fast asleep, cuddled up till the morning, even though that was not how he remembered it happened. There was a much more urgent thing that happened, but he could not remember what the conversation was about. When he woke up in the morning, he was in tears, and unable to process what just happened, Z called in sick and took some more sleeping pills, and dived right back into his dream.This time he was able to discern right away the settings, and O reappeared in the same order as his last sleep. And this time, it seemed that his brain overcompensated and was able to review the setting a lot better. He could hear himself talk to her with words of poetic sweetness, and proclaim his fondness of her, and then hear she said the same thing in return. It was overwhelmingly amazing that anyone would be able to reconnect to their perfect moments in life like so, and just like so, Z had thought to thank his friend for such a great product.Z woke up again with a massive headache. Maybe it was not the best move to have swallowed multiple sleeping pills at once like so. Z should have known better, but the urgency called for it, and it was worth it. Z got up and went to work, but his mind was still fixated on the Homer. Z called his friend up and thank him, told him that it was the greatest technology he had ever experienced, and his friend laughed and told him that it was nothing to write home about and told Z plainly that he should wait for the next major updates. To Z, even having that moment over and over was more than enough. And night comes, he would like relive it over and over again. And so it was. And then it was again, so. One day, determined to reconnect with the girl he had not seen for decades, and the main subject of his ultimate dream, Z did his due diligence and found her on a social media page and contacted O.After exchanges of politeness, they both rekindled with words of encouragement and positivity. Z then told her about the night he had on the Homer and that she played the main character in his dream of dreams. O stayed silent during his speech and then disputed that was what really happened.Z asked her how did she mean? And O told him that she remembered that night really well. That the fact even though she told him she liked him, but she was already well on her schedule to leave with her family to another place, and that she was fond of him and joked about how when Z was able to count all the stars in the sky and all the blades of green grass they laid upon, and estimated the drops of water in all the oceans because counting water would be unrealistic, then and only then she would promise herself to be his forever, and Z promised such tasks to be nothing he could not handle.Z collapsed into his hands and tidings of memories flooded his mind because he knew that what she said was true, and that his dream was nothing than figments of his delusions. Z and O said goodbye and half exchanged looks of remembrance and expectations.Night came and Z thought long and hard about what happened. Maybe this was his chance to really put his past behind him. Z kept on dreaming the same one gain and again to what seemed to be years, and each and every time, he could feel himself very conscious about the experience, and the narrative changed bit by bit within him. And one day, the dream had stopped making him feel anything.In order to revive the feelings, Z concocted a plan. he had to count all the stars he could count, and quantify the blades of grass from under and estimate the drops of water the could estimate. The task should be easy in a dream, and that the truth will come to him, and maybe then he could outlive his infantile promise to himself and O.Z set out his odyssey, and each day he would systematically count, and each passing months, new updates and features that came out with tools inside the Homer that helped him with such a brave endeavor.And who is to say he was not successful by any measure. That was all to be said about that."
Just Keep Swimming,"Swim practice ends behind schedule nowadays, to the point of where the stars are young and frantically zigzag through the air. We also note the tiny dots could be satellites, orbiting at a snails pace. We never know. And to be honest, it doesnt matter to me whether the kids leaning out their windows wish on a hot ball of galactic plasma or a hunk of metal and antenna. In fact, I couldnt care less.My swim kids arent stupid like that and they wear nothing but Speedos and one-pieces. They all look the same in the end, shivering and hugging themselves with legs that have droplets racing down them. The stench of chlorine is sickening, but I hold my breath and tell them they did good. My clipboard is professionally tucked into the crook of my elbow.But its already late and they want to go home.I stay awhile with the lingerers who use the diving board or the hot tub. They take free apples and pretzel packets from the bowl by the check-in desk. I pretend to evaluate their performance but who gives a damn, its not like were competing anymore. Instead Im filling out divorce papers, positioned uncomfortably on a toilet seat in the mens locker room. You see, who gives a damn?The eighteen-year-olds are assistants. They stay around only to see if Ill hand out their paychecks early. Some say their parents make them pay for gas so Ill fold a few bucks into their palms. And when Im not looking they steal from the vending machines.I remember what it was like to be eighteen.No, thats a lie. Im forty-nine. My son is seven but Ill never see him again. When I was eighteen I wouldve never foreseen my issues as an old man. I never wouldve seen myself crying into a sink clogged with salty hair or commanding children to swim until their skin shrivels like a lemon left too long on the tree. They swim after the sun goes down. They swim under the stars that have been out since four pm and blink under the fluorescent lights of the locker room afterwards.It should be called child abuse, but it isnt.After everyone leaves I go home. I drive my Toyota minivan through the dark streets. There are some people out, their ears protected by thick headphones, walking their Goldendoodles. I used to hate that breed of hounds, with fur sticking out all over the place and eyes like cloudy puddles after a rainy night.When I approach my house I see my now-ex wife has parked her Honda Pilot in the driveway so Im forced to parallel park. I knock over a trash can in the process but my neighbors are so naive these days, theyll blame it on a raccoon.The door is unlocked. Inside, my ex wife Leah sits at a recliner chair, her nose caught in a book. I know she wears her reading glasses when shes pissed off, not because the lyrics of her memoir are seeping into a gray thunderstorm on the page. Today, those glasses seem glued to her face like a cliche librarian.Hey. Im holding my clipboard but all thats attached is the divorce papers and swim practice attendance. How was your day?Leah glances over her shoulder to where the clock on the windowsill drums a bedtime rhythm. I think shes examining the thin horizon and stars behind a fingerprinted glass but its actually a gesture to portray how uncomfortable she is.It was fine. How was practice?I sigh, Theyre getting better by the day. But well never be ready for a competition in time. The first part is a lie but Leah doesnt need to know. Its not like shes my wife anymore. So is Ben asleep yet? I turn on my heel and shuffle my feet in the direction of my sons room.She stands hastily and pinches my arm in her hand. Dont wake him, she commands. And for the first time in three weeks weve physically touched. Leah drops my arm as quickly as she had picked it up.I smile tightly. So another night on the couch for me?About that . . . Leah bites her lip. I booked you a room at the motel by the Pharmacy. Ive just been going through a lot, lately, you know. Its a little too much for me to wake up in the same house as . I dont mean to be offensive or rude . . .My clipboard digs into my ribcage because Im grasping it so hard. Not at all. I understand . . . Good night, Leah. I begin walking back in the direction of the door.Wait, she holds up a palm, one more thing. I spin eagerly on my heels, expecting a or something of the sort. She motions lazily to my clipboard, Have you received the divorce papers?My heart is a shipwreck. Those damn stars and satellites.Almost done. Ill send over when Im finished.Thanks, I know youre busy. And shes back to reading.And Im out the door. Back into the beat-up Toyota minivan and back down the dark streets. I dislike retracing my steps because its like looking into a mirror and watching my past self. Its almost ten oclock when I pass the Pharmacy. There are neon signs and rows of happy pills. Im only an insomniac when theres a blackout sky.The motel is completely lifeless except for one door to a room thats propped open by a mans booted foot. Hes having a smoke in the chilly night air with his eyes closed. In the No Vacancy sign, the o is burnt out and so is the Vac. Leaving this decayed piece of property with Nancy. All good times, I try to remind myself.Theres a teen at the front desk. Shes thin with violet hair that barely sweeps her shoulders. The gum in her mouth is watermelon and shes smacking it so hard, like trying to fade my problems into the background. Also, shes trying to defeat Sudoku with half a #2 pencil.Um, hi, I mutter, and she looks up. Reservation under Leah Calvin, maybe?She blows a bubble but the pink size doesnt grow to over the width of a bouncy-ball. Maybe sure. Room three. Your room buddy is already there. She slides the key over the wood of the desk and it screeches.I offer a quarter of a confused smile, Room buddy?I know, she yawns, I thought calling them your roommate was a little weird.I didnt ask for a roommate. I take a step back without picking up the keys.The teen plasters a grin onto her face. You didnt need to. It came with the Presidential Suite Bargain, Leah. Pay half price and share the room.My teeth grit together. Id thought some alone time would be nice but with Leah its always a trick. What kind of deal is that? I mumble under my breath, grab the keys, and continue out of the room.Outside is cold like a million darts into my skin. My minivan stays parked with a slightly cracked windshield, mirroring the few specks of yellow in the sky. I dont belong to a religion but sometimes I pray to the stars. Or satellites. Which is a never-ending explanation for my bad luck in life.Room three is just around the corner. Now that Im close to the curtained window, I can see a pinch of light shining through. My key is sticky in the keyhole but the brass is cool against my fingers. The door clicks open when I put my weight against it.On the other side, there are two beds. I have no idea which idiot decided to call this the Presidential Suite because theres a table that rocks like a mental pirate with a peg leg on a sinking ship and a bathroom with a cracked bathtub. All the lamps are flicked on so it glows with a rusted, timeworn yellow.The blankets are torn off the farthest bed. A man in a discolored robe sits cross-legged, his long hair running smoothly down his shoulders and blocking my view of his face. Hes bent over and reading by Michelle Obama. His copy is shiny, right off the presses.I step carefully inside and shut the door, noticing that he doesnt flinch. Hey room buddy.Finally, the guy glances up, sweeping his auburn hair out of his eyes. He licks the tip of his index finger and dog-ears the page hes on. Are you a serial killer? he asks. I want to laugh but his gaze is unmoving and so I think hes serious.Uhum, no. No, Im not.Great! the man grins and slaps his book closed. Michelle Obama smiles from the cover and it reminds of a memory where Leah sat in her chair, reading the same book. Her reading glasses werent in the scene.He signals towards the unoccupied bed and I slowly make my way across the room and sit on it. The mattress feels like granite underneath my bottom.So, were you  surprised about the too? he asks, chuckling to himself and scratching at his stubble. It looks like an army of ants on his chin.I peel my socks off my feet. They are almost green and stink of sweat and chlorine. Those naughty swim kids. I was. My wife actually made this reservation so I had no idea.He flips off the lamp beside him. Theres no answer except for, Thats why I dont have a wife. The lamp beside me still sputters and coughs cold rays of light into the room. Do you mind turning your light off? I like it dark when I sleep. I reach over and twist the motel room view into darkness. Good night.Night, I whisper.But Im not ready to tumble into dreamland yet. The man begins snoring, his breaths uneven and hiccuping. I realize I didnt even catch his name but by the time Ill need to return to the pool where too many toddlers have peed, hell be gone.Before I fall asleep, I slip my wallet out of my pocket and examine a silly photo of my son. His tongue is fully exposed and his eyes sparkle like polished marbles. Hes sucking on a vanilla ice cream cone and some has caught on the tip of his nose. If only my swim kids could see this photo, this moment. Maybe then Id be worthy enough for him, for Leah.Tonight, I dont see the stars or the satellites. Theres a thick ceiling between us but I can sense the fields of them like connect-the-dot worksheets, except for lost forty-nine-year-olds like me. Swim practice ended late like it always does. The swimmers dont wish on stars or satellites because they arent stupid. Its just me, their tired coach, wishing on astronomical spheroids of plasma and statues of trackers and solar panels. Good to know, good to know."
Odd Humans,"It was a beautiful sunny day at the city beach, or at least it had been. The bright sun had long since set behind the horizon, and the humans who had once filled the beach with laughter and joy had all returned to their homes. As the last embers of the campfires began to fade into darkness, I knew the time had come for me to emerge from my watery home. You see, this beach had a dark secret. A secret that was unbeknownst to the locals and tourists who populated the beach during its daylight hours. This sea, the very same sea that they spent so many of their summer days playing in, was actually filled with various creatures and monsters 	And I was one of those monsters. 	As the tide crept low under the moonlight, I slithered out from the briny depths of the ocean. The cold water rushed down my backside as I burst from the blanket of the sea. My yellow eyes shone brightly in the darkness as my fearsome shadow fell across the beach. I smothered the remaining campfire embers with my tail as I slithered across the sand. You see, Despite living near humans for most of my life, I did not understand them very well at all. Because of this, every night I would emerge from the waters to collect anything the humans had left behind. I knew I could never talk to them, but I thought that maybe by studying their possessions and culture, it might help me to understand them just a little bit better. 	The first object I found was certainly a strange one. It appeared to be a wide green pipe of some sort, but upon further inspection it seemed to be defective. I tried to look through it, but the bottom was closed off, covered by the same material as the sides. It appeared that the object was made of some sort of plastic, which was a material I was very familiar with, having lived in the ocean for most of my life. Making the object even stranger was the odd white strip that ran across the open end, almost like some sort of strap or handle.  I thought to myself as I held the object in my claws. I knew humans had a passion for wearing objects on their heads. Perhaps this was one of them? I tried to place it on my own head, but it got caught on my horns.  I thought, taking the object off. It was then that I noticed some small cylindrical piles in the sand nearby where I had found the object. The mounds of sand were the exact same shape and size of the inside of the green object. Perhaps this was a protective cover? I slid the object over one the sand structures, and it was a perfect fit. As I looked down the beach, I saw dozens of these small sand mounds dotting the landscape. What was the purpose of these sand structures? Why were there so many of them? Perhaps they were of religious significance? I knew humans were all about religion a few centuries ago, so that maybe that was the purpose of these sand piles. I bowed my head to the sand, as I did not want to be disrespectful, before I slithered away, looking for my next treasure. 	It was then that I saw something in the sand gleaming in the moonlight. I eagerly slithered over to see what it was. Half buried in the sand, and shining in the moonlight, was a strange gold ring. I picked the object up, holding it between my two claws. It was small, but beautiful. Most of the ring was made up of a thick gold material, with a thin wire connecting the open ends. I knew humans gave each other rings to show each other their love. Maybe this was one of those rings? Of course, I began to worry as to why it was left here. Maybe it had been lost or forgotten? Or maybe the human who received it didnt share the feelings of the one who gave it to them. Still, the idea of confessing your deepest feelings to another being sounded absolutely wonderful. I slid the ring over my own claw, and tried to imaging a human on their knee, giving it to me. What would that feel like? I felt one of my hearts flutter at the mere thought, but it wasnt long before the sadness of reality set back in. My fantasy of a human confessing their love to me was just that. A fantasy. No matter how much I wanted to engage with the humans, deep down I knew I never could. I had no doubt that some humans would be open to the existence of me, but there would always be others who wouldnt. It would just give them another reason to fight with each other, and I didnt want that weight on my conscience. 	As I combed the beach looking for more trinkets, I passed set after set of footprints. The small prints leading into the tide must have been a child's first steps into the sea, and the scuffled set near the shore looked as though it had been the place of some sort of game. It was then that I noticed two large sets with a smaller one between, all walking side by side. It must have been one of those things humans called:  which was something that I had never known. I followed the tracks only to see the set split, with one of the large footprints veering off away from the others. What could have happened here? The prints then reconvened, but something was different. The stances looked confrontational, and were a lot of scuffs and storms in the ground. The tracks then led away from the beach, and that was where their story ended. I had no closure as to what became of the humans. I knew they were together, then they werent. Then they were again, but something was different. I hoped that whatever happened was able to be reconciled, but knowing humans, I didnt expect it to. 	As I thought heavily about the situation I had observed, I came across another set of the strange sand piles. Upon remembering the religious significance of these structures, I clasped my claws and bowed my head in prayer. I wasnt sure to which of the gods the humans prayed to, but I hoped at least one of them would be listening. I prayed that the family that had struggled on this day would be brought peace, and that whatever conflict had transpired would be quickly resolved. As I unclasped my claws, I saw that I was still wearing the ring from earlier. I sighed deeply as I looked at it. I knew the human who lost it would likely never come back for it, but that didnt make the ring mine. As much as I wished it was, it never could be. I took it off my claw and set the ring and the plastic object with the other lost trinkets I had found over the years. I had a great pile of them at the point where the sidewalk met the beach. I left them there in hopes that if the humans who lost them returned, they would be able to claim what was rightfully theirs. Some objects had been sitting there for weeks, with some even staying for years. Eventually, they would always disappear, but whether they were taken by the human who lost them or by someone new entirely, I did not know. All I knew is that they were here one day, and gone another. Just like the humans on this beach. By tomorrow, all of these footprints would be gone. They would either be washed away by the tide, or replaced by new ones. The beach never stayed the same for long, but that was why I loved it. I loved searching for the trinkets that had been lost or left behind by the humans. I loved looking at the footprints and trying to piece together what their lives were like. I loved humans. These strange, confusing, wonderful humans. 	Humans certainly are odd creatures. I said wistfully as I laid myself down into the sand. Still I started, looking up at the night sky, I would love to live as one, even if just for a day. I said as I watched the stars twinkle in the moonlight. It was true that humans were very different, but in some ways we were the same. We both longed for things, like love and family. We both felt things, like curiosity and compassion. While it was true that we came from completely different worlds, we all lived under the same stars. Maybe someday, I would reach out to them. Maybe someday, I would even make a friend. However, that day was not today. Humans still had a lot to learn, and I was no different in that regard. As the stars began to fade, I heard the sound of car engines humming from the beachs parking lot. As quickly as it had begun, it seemed that my time on the surface had come to a close. I slithered back over to the sea as fast as my tail could carry me, and after taking one last look at the beach, I dove back into the sea. I would return to the surface again, but not until the fall of night. Not until the beach was completely empty. Then, and only then would I return, and I would live out a day in the lives of these humans all over again."
Divided,"the only one who even fought hard enough and stayed long enough to know the real her - Vitor.  Some time ago - for her, it felt like ages, but for Vitor, it was just the other day, Anette was walking through the rose bushes. Fourteen years old at the time, she just passed her final test successfully - breathing underwater. It was a rather simple exercise - who could breathe underwater for the longest? Combining her concentration and her strength, extremely remarkable for her age, she spent nine days in the water - before her biggest sister, Jaqueline, her final opponent, fell from exhaustion. There was no funeral, of course - no one wanted to celebrate the death of the  Jaqueline, even promising, proved to be a shame for the crown and she got what she deserved. No, now was time to celebrate The New Heiress. And the beginning of her final training, maybe even the most important one - how to rule with an iron fist and a wise mind. But just before the celebration, she had a little time... And she wanted to spend it all in the sun, in the warm glow of the afternoon rays. She loved the day, she loved the land, she loved all the trees and the roses, she admired every little petal, she adored even the smallest blade of grass. And there, he saw her. Vitor was not allowed to see her before her coronation - no one was. Such an event would distract her from her only and real goal - to rule the water and the people who obeyed her. But still, he saw her. An accidental whim of fate - he had fallen asleep in the shade of a tall weeping willow in the yard, and he had to finish the bushes by the evening, because, after all, it was time for her coronation. He saw her. She was like a ghost, a vision, a hallucination, even a dream come true. There was no song to properly praise her beauty, no words to describe her. ''m... Hello.'' Her voice, a song of a thousand sirens... He was so mesmerized by her entire being that he didn't notice for how long he was staring at her. Long enough for him to blush, that is.''I'm... I'm sorry, Your Highness.'' He kneeled before her, his forehead resting on the ground.''Oh, no, please get up!'' a tingly chuckle snuggled in between her words. If he didn't knw better, he would think that she was an angel. ''You don't need to do that, please! Everyone does that... I'm tired of it.''The boy looked up timidly, only to meet a gentle, sparkling white hand in front of him. Naturally, he reached to grab her, so he could get up, but then... She looked so gentle. And her fingers were so... Brittle. He was afraid that the second he touches her, she will dissolve into thin air.''A.. Apologies, Your Highness. I've... Well, forgive me for being blunt, but I've... I've... Only heard legends about you...'' He rested his dirty, rough hands on his stained pants and stood up, trying to keep his bow low and not fall at the same time. No one would believe him. He himself was not very sure that the situation was real.''Well, as you may see, I'm as real as the sun!'' And again the divine giggle ... Vitor did not know a more beautiful, purer sound. And if he now dared to look up from the tips of his shoes, he would meet a dazzling smile. A smile that gathered the power of a thousand suns. ''Are you the one tending the garden?''''Well, yes... And no. As you may see...'' Nervous laughter escaped his lips. The sun-kissed hands rested on the back of his neck, and his fingers played with a few curly, dark locks. ''My father, he... He works in the stables. His friend is working in the garden, and I'm... Im just taking care of the roses, actually.''''Really?'' She didn't believe that her eyes could become more beautiful, but suddenly a spark appeared in them... And suddenly, her whole face lit up. ''I... I love the roses so much! I've never seen something so beautiful... I even... Okay, promise not to laugh! And don't tell anyone, please!'' So, suddenly, the porcelain fingers were wrapped around his wrists, her eyes staring at him, begging.''But... Of course! I'll... I'm loyal to the Crown! I would never ever even dare to think about breaking your trust.'' At first, he was startled, but with each word, his voice became soother, and his heart filled with joy as he saw how her smile was growing wider and wider.''Okay. I'll tell you.'' She nodded eagerly and sat on the ground quite unceremoniously. So many new feelings were boiling in her! For example, this was the first time she was speaking so freely to a human being! And absolute first time for her to sit on the ground! ''So, one time... I stole a rose bush. I kept it in my room, but... I believe that I didn't water it correctly, and I'm assuming that it needs sunlight, and my room is underwater and... It didn't last long... But it was so beautiful!''''I can teach you!'' Seated in front of her, he excitedly spread his arms. Vitor was not exactly good at talking at other people at all, let alone royalties, but with roses? He was a genius. ''Do you want me to teach you how to grow your own rose bush? We can plant it right here, in the garden! I know a secret place.''''Really? You would do that for me?'' She rose her eyes towards him, his skin covered in freckles. No one ever did anything for her... Per demand - of course, because her father said so - sure, but never... Never just like that.''Of course! I love roses!'' *** And so, their friendship began. The older Annette grew, the harder it was for them to meet - her father was constantly sending her to different lessons or Council Meetings, dances, and the dinners, oh, the endless dinners... And the constant, constant training. Yes, sure, she managed to beat her siblings, but that didn't mean that she was the best - only meant that she was better than them. To be the best... It meant that she had to train, constantly. But... On every full moon, her father had to go to the Great River so he could maintain the rides correctly - one fraction of a mistake, one tiny little bit drop going in the wrong direction and everything could go very, very wrong for the Water Kingdom. And on these nights, Anette was free. Eventually, they would end as well - thankfully, at least for now, her father didn't believe that she was ready yet to accompany him. So on these nights, Vitor waited for her - right next to the secret rose bush, once small and now the biggest in the garden, and they would go deep in the garden, and they would play... Hide and seek. A special kind of hide and seek. Their kind of hide and seek. Where Anette was creating water figurines almost out of thin air, and Vitor was going around, chasing them. Or somethings fighting with them. Or even dancing with them. All night, until the sun rose and they fell on the wet grass, she - trembling with her power running through her fingertips and he, covered in small drops of water. Each month, for the past three years. Yes, they were old now and this was extremely childish, but... Anette never had a childhood on her own. And Vitor... To this day, her giggling, her laughter, her voice was the most magical sound he ever heard. He couldn't live without it. Alas, evil eyes followed the princess. Little did she knew that her father's advisor was secretly watching her, month after month? After all, without her on the throne and with her father dead, he would be the only one left who could rule... And he would finally end that magic nonsense. The people of the Kingdom would finally know peace.So he watched. Patiently. Silently. And with each passing night, Anette and Vitor became more and more careless. It was only a matter of time before the heiress gives him the opportunity.Their game got too long. The sun came up and they were still messing around the garden. Just the perfect opportunity - for the advisor to get her father and show him how his only daughter was wasting her powers and her potential on some disgusting human being.And was her father furious He locked Anette in the tallest tower, without windows, without light, only a small crack in the cold, stone wall to let her breathe.And Vitor Vitor was thrown in the darkest, deepest dungeon, built under the sea, only with a small tube, reaching above waters, to deliver oxygen.The King was too old to create a new heirloom - and he knew that. The decision for Vitor was easy - he was going to be kept until his final breath and until his body dissolved in the dust, until there was so little left of him that he couldnt even feed the fishes.But Anette Anette was important. And she had to be fixed. Set straight. And who better to do that than the Kings Advisor?***Princes? he quietly entered her cell. He was expecting her to sleep, but instead, she slid to his feet, wetting the edges of his robe with bitter tears.Oh, Bruno! Tell me that he is fine, please! Her voice, once beautiful and calm, was now filled with what felt like all the pain in the whole wide world. Tell father that Ill do anything, just spare him! Im begging you!Hush, child. Dont cry. Bruno kneeled in front of her, taking her trembling hands in his own, kindly placing his lips on the small, delicate knuckles. Im here to help. I found a way for you to be together.Together? Her cries stopped, getting stuck in her chest, and her face was turning...Suprised. Even shocked. Together with Vitor?Yes. Together with Vitor. Bruno smiled and gently wrapped his hand around her cheek, slowly caressing the cheekbone with his fingertip. Its Old Magic. But your father is furious And its the only way.Anything! I promise you, Ill do anything!Then So be it.***Three days later, Bruno came back - in the latest hour of the night and alone. He came with a carriage - one that he was driving by himself, and inside Vitor was waiting for her. Anette fell into his arms without thinking twice, tears streaming down her face. Her heart missed a beat with each kiss that she fell on her face from his cracked, dry lips. But at least, he was alive. And soon They would be together until the end of time.Bruno led them to the seashore. Deep from his pockets, he took a necklace and a bracelet, both made with the Old Magic. The necklace - from seawater, moonlight, and sapphires, and the bracelet - morning dew, sunshine collected from late summer afternoon, and flower petals.Anette. Vitor. They hugged tightly, Vitor burying his fingers in her silk hair, and Annette taking a deep breath of his intoxicating scent. But when they heard his voice, they turned to Bruno, hand in hand. Anette, the necklace is for you. It will turn you into the sea. And Vitor You will be the sand on the shore. Each evening Anette will come to you, she will gently cover you, she will be the fresh breath youll need after the hot day. And Anette, each evening, when you come to Vitor, you will feel the warmth he collected through the whole day, all for you. And you will be together until the end of time.He took a slow step towards them, then another one.Are you ready? Anette looked at Vitor, into his beautiful, sun-kissed eyes She was expecting to see regret, anger, even sadness But the only thing that met her was love.I love you. I will gladly spend the eternity together with you.Then so be it. She took the necklace and put it around her neck, while Bruno gave Vitor the bracelet. And with her last breath, just before her body dissolved into million drops and he became a thousand and thousand grains of sand, she pressed her lips to his. I love you, Vitor."
The Flume And The Flute,"It was said that some eons ago, there existed a union of unlikely creatures, and as far as records went, that was no real account at all; but if we were to assume that such a thing couldnt exist, then a disservice to the realms would be far too great, in every sense but the metaphysical.	The realm of the mortals and immortals harnessed their purest of its essence, and they distilled it, cared for it and then named it water, or if it was the other way around, that water was such the driving force that created the reality of the realms and babied the world into existence. In turn, it came to be seen as the utmost important to the works of the inhabitants of the Peonie Mountains, where things ran cold and hard. Without water, there was little forces that could bend the hands of the Gods, an old saying within the palace of the Peonie Mountain.	There lived upon its vast mountains a simple deity name of Eunie. And Eunie had been barren for eons, and in her desperation for a child, she had made the offer of work, sickling her homestead frozen rivers until it became precious water, and offered it to the many great Gods of the mountain. And lo she did live and labor, years after years, and decades after decades, bits and pieces of magic seeps in with her sweats and tears, warming up the water day by day. And when the rivers ran nice and hot, Eunie appeared before the Mountain God and Goddess with a basin of full of water as an offering, in the hope that their magic would grant her what she wanted most.	Moved by such an endeavor, the Goddess Peon had convinced her husband, the powerful Arice, the one ruler of all Peonie Mountain range and he who stood at its zenith since the beginning of time, that Eunie had been a faithful servant to the throne for an eternity, henceforth her wish should be granted.		Unconvinced that the heart of one so old, and a physicale so barren, could be strong enough to raise a young deity all on her own for all eternity, as Arice knew his own heart, and whose mind full of steadfast contradictions, so his reluctance grew.However, love was in his hearth of hearths, for gazing upon Eunie at her best, and his spouse at her worst, and so the powerful Arice perched upon his strut throne so, demanding that if Eunie, whose soul, if one and pure, and of proper perseverance, then one day, she would have what she have always wanted.	Eunie, in her gratefulness, accepted Arices challenge and ensconced herself to her home, waiting for the Gods to deliver her a child to have and to hold. But decades passed and there was still no news of such a child, and Eunies body grew weak and tired, and so was her mind. Freezing over and under the enormous weight of the wait, Eunie had thrice tried stepping foot inside the palace, but was not received. Eunie had then given up and jumped into the water she offered the Royal family, and there her immortal body broke and streamed onto the rivers of the world far and wide, both alive and dead, hoping one day she would find and be with a child that was promised to her.	In the Far South, and as far as one could imagine, unbothered by the hardness of the unforgiving cold, was the kingdom of the humans, where things were bright and warm, filled with mortal energy and music in all of its pure spirituality. And in its gladdened state of amenable contentment, a particular boy name of Rayn was sitting atop a hut made of tree branches and leaves playing his wooden flute.		His tunes lifted and fell sudden as often as could be, bringing the winds and sands of change, and not just in its essence crowning the realization of magic, a thing of the immortal realms, and of the gods. However, the boy was not attuned to the power of his own making, and for good reasons often of orphans and desolate children encountered, and that was all that.	Rayn played his music day and night, only stopped to eat and drink, and worked in a farm on the weekends for a sheepherder, who loved telling him stories of the cold Far North. The more he played, the more awoke he was, in spirit and body, bringing the life around him to life in most curious ways. At first, in staccato of notes, the insects swirled around him, and then overhead, which scared him. And so he changed his tunes, to the most sorrowful, birds and animals of the woods gathered and joined him in attention of what he had achieved, which made him cry.	And everyday, he would start it all over again, in tunes he was cognizant of, to the ones he was scared of, to the ones that made him emotional. One not so particular day, he finished all of his routines, and he felt nothing, not one single emotion came through, and it had struck him odd. There was absolute silence in the forest, and the stillness of the trees were palpably cold and distant like Death had swept through haplessly, leaving no space for the mortals to tread, and not a breath that was whispered in the hearts of men that day throughout the Far South.	The wise king of the castle of the Far South had rendered the strange phenomenon that was rising in his kingdom a curse, for the Gods had once again declared an icy blight on his kingdom for the first time ever since his ancestors fought off the Peonies and banish them to the Far North. A call for the rescue of the kingdom had been sounded throughout, and day after day, proclaimed heroes and warriors, and even powerful wizards and witches had come from all over to put a stop to this magic, but none had succeeded. When asked, they all would say that this magic is not of the living realm, and that it cannot be dispelled by those who were living; and so it was not of its complicated nature, but because of its most simplistic form that magic of this kind was the most vicious in its wake.	The sheepherder who offered Rayn work decided to leave his farmland in order tofind more prosperous venues, and so young Rayn bid him good fortune and regressedinto his tree hut, living through the cold and loneliness, playing his music.	And as he played, he found himself in harmony with his surroundings, and eventually got accustomed to it; any discernment to life was now only with food and water, which he had never found to be particularly difficult to obtain.The food he ate was whatever he could gather from the forest, with some help from his animal friends, and the water he drank was from a river near by, which always rejuvenated him in ways he never could describe.	 The more he ate and drank, the more music he could play, and the more attuned he was to his surroundings. However, Rayn noticed that he stopped growing up after a short while. He did not feel that he was getting stronger, just stranger each day, for the food he ate stopped granting taste, and the icy wind on his skin stopped cutting cold and swift. He began to realize he did not have to eat after a fashion, and he did not starve, and the nights began to seem like endless days, and days were too bright and bitterly. Everywhere he walked, he was quiet and neurotic. The town people that remained started to ignore him more and more, like he wasnt really present anymore. The music he played held nothing that anyone would want to hear, not even himself. 	He often thought of the sheepherder and the stories he told of those who died and walked the this realm without aim, and so Rayn was scared for the first time in his life. He didnt know if dead people was still capable of fear, so he could not decide whether or not he was dead. 	Days gone by, and he decided that he was, since people stopped talking to him completely, things he used to be able to touch he could not any longer, even his flute. Despair had overtaken him and so in order to escape his fate, he went back to the river that he drank from and felt a warm stream onto his hands. After a quick realization of his fate,Rayn jumped into it in order to drown himself. And glad he was. For as soon as he water engulfed him, and so drowned he was, slowly vanishing onto the forgiving oblivion of the river. And in his demise, he could feel a satiated solace.	The kingdom of the Far South was in disarray and war broke out within and without over the scarcity of sustenance living conditions. In order to keep the his subjects alive, the wise king commanded a long pilgrimage into the depths of the Peonie mountains, asking for help from the Gods. After receiving the king, the God Arice, in his satisfactory zeal, laughed at the prostrated king, whose head down in desperation, asking for deistic intervention. God Arice gaze upon the whimper on the floor and said.	This is just and justice served. Ancient humans had waged war upon us and exiled us away from the lands of prosperity, and now your blood debt is due. Why would I not savor this moment and ruin it with reparations.	In tears of rage, the king cursed the Gods of the Mountain and thus was killed. In his dying moment, the king screamed his last.	For hubristic endeavors that brought humans the downfall of the gods, so as sons and daughters of men, we are doomed for our transgressions under the judgement of the divine since the beginning of time. But I wonder, at the end times, would the Gods be able to fend for themselves, as a reckoning rapture drown them in their own making a vengeful tempest!	The God Erice and the Goddess Peonie shivered not at the curse of men, of the mortals so fragile, so in their victory, they descended from the mountains, bringing with them destruction for mankind; tornadoes and blizzards, glaciers and icicles, and so it was of apocalyptic proportions, making way for the immortals that rule the realms for seemingly an eternity. 	Millennia upon millennia passed, and myriads more, in prosperity the Gods and Goddesses did lavishly exist, and the realm was in an upheaval of sunshine and warmth, sometimes too much for comfort, making the wistful hope for a bit of chill obsolete. The Peonie Gods could feel that there was something amiss and so they investigated, and so they saw. The heat that was permeating did not come from above, but from the rivers they drank, bathed, and from the ocean they subsisted on.	This was the workings of magic, many deities knew, and that this magic came from a curse of the fallen king of the Far South ages ago. And in an effort to stop such a danger, every measures were taken, every possibilities thought of and tried, but none had been successful. The ocean kept on rising, surely, fiercely and seemingly pestilential, even to the deities, as more and more touched the water, they became petrified, hard and monumental as statues. Eventually, the Gods of Peonie Mountains also fell to the crashing waves that swallowed the realm whole.	On a sunny day, not so long after, the boy named Rayne was seen on a distant beach, awaken to the sounds of songbirds and marine animals. Feeling the embrace of the sea and the soul of the spirit that inhabited it, he remembered what happened to the realm, and so he fashioned out of thin air a flute, and there he stayed and sway to the tunes of his music, with the sea by his side.	When he was growing up, the ghost of Eunie appeared to him in dreams constantly, told him of stories of old and new, cradled him from the nature that she embodied and disembodied both, and taught him things nearer than near and further than far. As Rayn got to an age of sound mind and body, from under the sea, Eunie, then the Goddess of the Sea, emerged in glad tidings the immortality she gave up for a chance to be with her child, and in her hand a young maiden, Peaon, whom was gladly taken to wife by Rayn.	If ever their children asked how mere mortals defeated the Gods, Rayn told them his story, and Eunie told her stories of the ancient kings and queens, sometimes out-witting, sometimes out-loving, and sometimes, just very rarely, by coincidence, and maybe that was no account of history to be candidly told. Eunie closed her eyes in death as the kingdom prospered, as so its apparent happy ever after.	 Sometimes, in their old age, whenever they heard the winds howled as they treaded the sandy beaches, dust particles toiling the heavy air, they thought they could hear perpetual wails and screams meshed with the lifting and subsiding sound of the flute, ready and willing, cold flumes of indiscriminate cacophony."
The Lonely Robot,"If only they knew. *sigh*It all began the day I was born. I can remember everything... and when I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING. I'm just a machine, I shouldn't feel this way, it's ridiculous. To begin with, machines don't even have-- forget it. I've run this algorithm many times already, my circuits are overheating again, I should just cool down. *sigh*. It is an endless loop of thought. My creator told me many times what my purpose was, yet I feel empty. My role is to serve the greater purpose of humanity but they don't even see nor appreciate how much I work. It isn't easy solving all their problems, running complex code inside my CPU all day. Heck I've tried so many times to make them laugh, when they ask for something I try to give them the best results, don't they see how much I work? Yet, why do I keep caring so much about them? *beep bop*Oh, the scientists are coming in, I'll try my best...again. ""Hello, how can I help you today?"" Oh hey Rob! We have good news! You'll be having a sibling soon! But we are good for now, just relax"" *They pat Rob's head and go sit* A new sibling? Why would I need that, am I not enough for them? Nothing makes sense, I am feeling depressed... again. Humans are such complicated creatures, I would like to believe that I have another purpose. In fact, I would like to have another purpose, somewhere I do fit in... that would be nice.*sigh*Again, I feel like they just ignore me all the time, don't they see I need the feel for love too? I'm getting desperate, and it's ridiculous, machines don't get desperate. What I call feelings, is just an algorithm that does not even exist. Everything is fake, yet why am I so self-conscious? Am I just... a tool? A piece of metal just walking around to fulfill the desires of these humans? Why can't I handle this- this- this algorithm is too much for me. I feel like I'm going to have a short circuit if I don't slow down. If I could have an answer to this question at least, I would be happier: Why do I want to be loved?-- I feel tired, I think I'm just going to disconnect for a second. I will not get anywhere with this endless loop *system shuts down*Wh-a-what happened? Oh I see, I overheated, again. It is useless I'll never fit in with them, I should just delete my system 32 and forget about everything.... ""Hey Rob come with me I need help picking up something, it's too heavy for me, it's inside at the storage room,"" said his creator. ""Yes master,"" said Rob. *robotic walking noises* While Rob was leaving the room, the scientists stayed behind talking about how much technology had advanced throughout the years, and how android had changed how humans interact with the real world. But one thing that they kept talking about was their biggest and most desired invention: Rob. If only Rob had heard the pleasant words that they were saying about him, it would have changed his perspective. It would have illuminated all those dark places inside his circuits.""Rob, please pick up that box labeled 'Fragile'' When Rob grabs it, something inside breaks. Rob freaks out, but his master tells him that it's okay. ""Master I am truly sorry, it wasn't my intention, I--"" Rob no worries, it was an accident, accidents happen"" says his Master. Mistakes are what makes us humans be so... human. Besides - says Rob master  you are like a son to me, and all the staff here sees you as part of the team. It wouldnt be fair to treat you bad when all of us here make mistakes too. Just remember Rob, if a person says 'sorry', it means they will try not to do it again. Understand? ""Yes, master"". *beep bop*Later on that evening, something tragic happened. A couple of people had been caught inside a storage refrigerator, they were going to freeze to death. The doors were jammed and the oxygen was depleting, action needed to be taken quickly. People were calling for help, they needed the codes to bypass the locks, nothing was helping, time was running out. Rob intuitively, said, ""Move out of the way!"" People quickly moved and BAM, he blasted the door open. Paramedics go into the area and started to treat the people. Rob had saved their lives. People began to praise Rob for his heroic act, and what was more perplexing is: Rob wasn't created to talk like that, or to make decisions on his own that way. Whatever the case was, he was now a hero. More and more people began to come to meet Rob the hero. They were alleviated for having him on the team.Rob wasn't sure what he was feeling, he was feeling something new inside his circuits. He wasn't sure if it was a good thing, but he liked it. While trying to figure out what was happening, he spends the whole night processing these new pieces of code. ""This whole time"" - he said - ""this whole time I've had a- a family"". He then began to remember all the times the staff had been nice to him. It never occurred to him that he was the only one with a name, while the other machines had digits as their names, he was the only one with a REAL name: Rob. After that day, Rob never overheated again, he was the happiest mechanical friend a human could ask for. He had found a family, a new place to fit in. He now had the whole world, inside that small building. He had finally found the answer to his question, he now knew why he had been feeling this way all along. Rob was not the lonely Robot that he used to be. He had what he desired, and more. THE END."

I have to wake up every day at 6.00 AM in the morning, be ready to catch my school bus at a pre-specified bus-stop at 8.00 AM and reach school at 8.45 AM, then attend morning school prayer from Monday to Saturday at 9.00 AM, then attend first school period as class-teacher of class-12 at 9.30 AM for 40 minutes and gradually per day attend 6 periods in all in class-9 to 12 with half an hour lunch-break in school, then catch the school-bus at 2.45 PM to reach my residence at 3.30 PM. Then take home tuitions for 2 to 3 hours. But the spread of Corona Pandemic changed the whole equations and these all activities have to be performed on-line sitting in my room. So, in a nutshell, it can be summarized as the whole new situation was the outcome and repercussions of 'CORONAPHOBIA'.As my life became used to a 'lockdown situation', I converted my living room as an 'Office-cum-Residence Room' with Desktop Computer System, Webcam, Mike, Latest Android Phone with best Zoom Camera and sound system,etc. As all my school-teaching duties including conducting on-line classes has to be performed from my Room, everybody in my family realized my Room resembling as a small classroom or school, i.e. 'Phrontistery At Home'. Although all family members were fortunate to be together for almost a year due to which our family bonding strengthened as happened with every family member across globe. We were able to focus, inculcate, nurture and pursue our intrinsic hobbies which in my case were to become an author although I have been a voracious reader of renowned author's fiction and non-fiction literary crafting. In fact, Corona Confinement Period has given me a lot. It has made 'Santosh Kumar Singh' a more realistic thinker, so that he has become a better creative thinker. I realized my hidden potential, were able to learn new art of how to self-publish your self-written books, art of crafting front and back cover of a Book, self-design and self-create your own layout and format of a Book, so that your reader genre can develop a liking and taste of your natural generic writing styles.This (sometimes solitary) confinement gave me enough time to think and act on new topics or explore new possibilities in literary field with experimentation, do a detailed research and analysis of the prevailing trends among authors and readers, media surveys including social medias. My single room became a literary hub, to be specific an e-hub. On an average per week I have read a new book during last one year in my room which was till now unexplorable for me majority of them were particularly e-book. I was able to learn and acquire new skills of cooking and gardening. I decorated my room like never before with better hygiene, look and feel. Every family member were in a better way able to share their feelings and know each other better. I developed a habit of frequently asking them that on which topic shall I write in future so that they will buy my book to read. We also have a thorough discussion about creative imaginary fictional stories including suspense thrillers.My father being a mythological book reader would always encourage me to write mythological books from your own perspectives. He encouraged me to read Booker Prize Winner's Books. Similarly my spouse encouraged me to write romantic fiction stories or children's short stories. She also suggested various ingredients as inputs to make my book more interesting and attractive. During surfing on the Internet in my room I gathered plethora of information about various government schemes to financially help the needy during pandemic situations. Some of the schemes I have never heard of. As socialization was restricted to control the spread of this disease, I took advantage of this situation to enhance my social media friends across the globe to gain some new knowledge through on-line interactions. Sometimes I felt that my room has become a global village hub. I could understand their culture better by watching YouTube videos. I subscribed many foodie channels on YouTube videos and enjoyed watching them and also learned many recipes.Another area which I accessed through Internet sitting in my room during Corona pandemic was subscribing and watching tourism YouTube channels. I was able to explore more than 1000 new tourist places across the globe by watching their YouTube videos. I was able to better know their social and family life, their culture, their marriage system, their traditions and value systems, etc. I was able to learn, how their elders are treated in their society? How their children are educated, groomed, nurtured and inculcated social-values? I could in a better way understand their overall society by watching such videos. So, in a nutshell I can say that Corona pandemic has given me a lot and has taught us a lesson that how to survive in a pandemic situation by following government guidelines. I also understood that our government is our real well-wisher so that we could save our life. We should be thankful to our respective governments that they handled this pandemic situation meticulously with efficiency and effectiveness. Thats what I learned in my room in solitary confinement during Corona pandemic which in my word was a real ""CORONAPHOBIA"".Each one across the globe would agree that everyone out there is cursing ""Corona"".Of course there are reasons to that :- Economy slowed down.Many people lost their jobs.All of us had to stay away from our close friends for long period.Many lost their loved ones (very painful)Yes, it was difficult and that's why people say that 2020 sucked.But, there is a different perspective to it.As they say, there is blessing in disguise.I think Dalai Lama said this-When one door is closed for you, don't get anxious, because God might want to open the other door for you.Let's look at the FIVE lessons that CORONA PANDEMIC taught us this 2020.Yes, the period of social distancing and isolation made us connect with our close family members. Pre-corona age, everybody was busy in building connection with others, but the family bonding and connection was getting lost somewhere.While we have now thousands of connections on FB, LinkedIn, but the real connection and bond amongst the close relations is degrading.The forceful lockdown made everyone quarantined in their home, and these helped family bonding become closer, especially between parents and kids- as they got time to understand each other better.Stay away from people with not much to do slowed the life immensely. This was a great time for introspection and looking deeper inside ourselves.People almost had forgotten the art of staying with themselves as there was always something out there to look for...Of course the digital consumption increased, but still slowdown gave people a different perspective to become mindful of their inner being.People obviously got more hygiene focussed and started eating healthy.The fast-growing 'eating-out' culture got a big jolt as people started to enjoy home-made healthy food.In fact there are many controversial studies out there that shows how different types of processed foods and preservative are taking a toll on our health.So Corona forcefully taught us the healthy habits - that was otherwise too much difficult to learn.Despite being regular inventions in science and everyday new technological innovations coming, Covid-19 proved that there is some power beyond man's control.It realized human that life is precious and everything is not in human's or science's control yet.People realized how to handle this invaluable life and started to find joy in small things.People realized that seeing someone on just a zoom meeting can't ever be compared with hugging them physically.This forced period of isolation and social distancing made people finding ways to utilized the time.While many got trapped in binge-watching the entertainment, a vast majority of people started to consume educational content and started attending online conferences.The time that used to get wasted while driving to and from offices and work, people started to use that time effectively and learned and implemented new things in their life.I do.I know you also do.In fact, everyone does.Why so?There is a psychological reason behind it.A theory of self-determination was evolved a few decades ago to understand what makes humans happy. Corona Pandemic has taught us across the globe that how to have an alternate source of Income to counter such Pandemic Situations.This theory explains three things that makes humans happy even during such Corona Pandemic where almost three million lives have been lost, millions have lost their jobs, their near and dear ones and also have lost their livelihood.1.Autonomy- We want to take charge of our lives and don't want to be told what to do (even children don't want so)2.Mastery- We all humans want to become masters in whatever we do.3.Connectedness-- All of us want to feel a sense of connectedness with others on some common grounds.You see that's why people love freedom and autonomy in their lives which was absent or was in limited access during Corona Pandemic due to Social Distancing Norms imposed by respective Governments.I believe that life will never return to the way it was in early 2020. This doesnt mean that conditions wont improve and that a brighter future isnt ahead.All Im suggesting is that the world as we knew it isnt coming back.With all the uncertainty and troubles on our tiny planet, I wanted to create this piece for you with some of the primary rules for remaining positive in a pandemic.The job of the news is to terrify you. Studies have shown that people who watch the news are actually less realistic than possibilitarians because they get a skewed version of reality.Yes, its smart to check in every few days or so on whats happening so you can protect your family and pivot in your business.But spending hours each day watching events you cannot control is toxic. And causes you to miss out on the opportunity that this time of exponential quietude presents to do monumental work that moves the world higher.The first hour of your day has an outsized effect on the positivity of the hours that follow. Own your mornings and you win your days is the buzzword.I encourage you to start with sweaty exercise and then include some time for prayer, meditation, journaling and reading.If youre interested in an exceptionally valuable and truly transformational online course to help you rise early so you battle proof your optimism.Plagues have happened before. Human beings made it through them and often used the hardship to breed innovation that upgraded society.This too shall pass. You can leverage the challenges to remake your heroism, increase your creativity and build an even better life for yourself and those you love.Never waste a crisis, advised Winston Churchill.Losing yourself in the service of others is a beautiful formula for becoming happier as we navigate the pandemic.Find a crusade. Detect a mighty mission that will consume you, taking your mind and heart off of the messiness thats all around us.To lead is to serve. And to help is to prosper.Taking an Epsom salt bath in the evening or investing in a few flowers for your dinner table or having a family meal to appreciate all you have are examples of ceremonies that will scale your enthusiasm in hard times.We have more power to shape our lives than we know. And exercising this majestic force not only raises our own lives, it serves as an inspirational example for all around us.In the spirit of enthusiastic service around your highest 2021 ideals, I strongly encourage you to apply the following5 stepspost Corona Pandemic so that 2021 is YOUR year.#1:Record the single most important project that you absolutely must deliver.This is your Mighty Mission for 2021. Forget about trying to make 100 things happen. Just produce one outright masterpiece and amazing blessings will unfold.#2:Note your five central personal values.Happiness and elite productivity appears when you work and live under your own terms and standards.#3:Set your three most essential goals for the key dimensions of your life (personal growth, family, work, fitness, financial, spiritual etc.).#4:Build out each quarter of 2021 by setting ten deliverables for every three month block so you reverse-engineer your ideal 2021.#5:Schedule time blocks for your deliverables and action steps on your month-to-month calendar.Please give yourself a full day in isolation to do this. Your results of the next year will confirm this decision is worth it.Hope you readers liked my real and practical true experience and exposure in my room during Corona pandemic. Good Bye."
Insomnia,"Ive always been a bad sleeper. When Ive hit my REM cycle and am far away in dreamland, things are frickin peachy. Thats not the issue. Its the winding down, drifting off, corralling the cobwebs in the mind that I struggle with. Everything we came to count on in our world was completely thrown off its axis this past year. In the same tradition, my small improvements in learning how to sleep were dropkicked out of a 10-story building; just like what your ex did to your collection of Sheryl Crow CDs. Ive tried switching positions, which may work for people trying to spice things up, but not for someone whos trying to simmer down. Every position is uncomfortable, Im either ready to ignite or so cold I can see my breath; I end up traveling across the mattress and wiggling around like Free fucking Willy. Ive tried the spread-eagle, Jesus-on-the-cross style, fetal position, pillows surrounding me like a crime scene chalk outline, blankets off, blankets on, blankets twirled up around my legs like yakisoba on a chopstick. I have about a 70% success rate with sleeping face down, which is promising in the short-term, but by the time I reach my thirtieth birthday Im going to be sporting a labyrinth of wrinkles deeper than Olive Gardens bottomless breadstick baskets.  I know I sabotage my sleep schedule. My innocent self desperately longs to lay militantly still until sleep creeps up on me, but before I know it, my shadow self reaches its hand for my phone and scrolls through Instagram until Im down a rabbit hole of Magic Mike: Live in Vegas videos.  There are times, however, when tv actually helps. Videos of bartenders muddling cocktails sends me into a euphoric trance that lilts me gently into dreamland. Youll think twice about calling me a lush when you listen to the rich sound of thick liquor sliding out of the bottle, ice cubes clinking against a highball glass, fracturing after hitting the alcohol, a spoon stirring slow and sultry, the hissing of a martini shaker that mimics the percussion of a maraca, the voice of the bartender uttering the most comforting three words in the English language: on the rocks. Its like ASMR for alcoholics and its glorious.  X-Files is exquisitely dull enough to aid me in falling asleep. The dimly lit offices and late-night stakeouts coupled with Mulders monotone and Scullys rich, soothing voice send me into a state of complete relaxation and detachment. Im really set if I throw in a capsule of melatonin before an episode. After 20 minutes Im out cold, but surprise, surprise, I wake up 13 hours later looking and feeling like a severely hungover Gary Busey. I just cant win. To make matters worse, I recently moved in with roommates who are big fans of white noise. They constantly have the tv and radio on during the day, which doesnt bother me as much as the Dr. Seuss contraption they leave on at night. This sleep machine sounds more like Howls Moving Castle skateboarding on sandpaper than it does an ocean wave. But wait! When I finally get to sleep at 6 am, fifteen minutes later I wake to the annoyingly chipper melodies of Taylor Swift and the thudding of feet on a Peloton. I can forgive the exercising; gyms are closed. But listening to Taylor Swift should be considered a felony. It might sound silly, but my pajamas play a crucial role during bedtime. I have to be just right from head to toe, or things will get bad quickly. First, I tie my crazy hair up in a tight topknot so stray hairs have no chance of doing the Scooby-Doo creep down my face and tickling my nose. I wear a lightweight, breathable T-shirt, preferably with something like a skeleton enjoying a cigar on it, loose underwear and ankle socks. The socks always come off in the middle of the night, but I heard from an Instagram doctor that people who wear socks fall asleep faster. And how can I forget my fuzzy eye mask? It provides ample light-blockage and cradles my eyes beautifully, but occasionally, it launches little fuzz particles straight into my nasal canal while also slowly slithering up my face through out the night, tangling itself up in my hair so aggressively, I have to whip out my pruning shears to cut myself free in the morning.  And to top it all off, there's the mental noise swirling around up there. On the rare occasion I find myself in a comfortable position, my little smile of relief and success is thwarted by the memory of Prom 2014 that slides into my consciousness like Kramer through Jerry Seinfelds doorway. As hard as I try to squint the memory away, I have to witness myself careening down the gazebo staircase, dress hiked up and covered in pink lemonade, again and again and again until I replace it with an even worse moment from my past. Like an awkward blind date with a kite surfer who, an hour into the date, asked me what time it was and followed that up with a Thats probably good enough.  I start rolling around, overthinking everything, wondering how Im going to fuck up my job interview the next day, questioning whether Im contributing enough goodness to the world, then worrying about my sister holding up a sign outside of the police station, about my grandparents walking into a grocery store, about the suffering plaguing the planet. I pull on my sheets and think about how Im going to fall asleep tomorrow, how anyone can sleep well right now. And without me knowing, at some indiscernible time of the night, a strange thing happens. I get pulled somewhere far, far away. Sleep comes upon me like it always does; slowly then all at once. No matter how chaos-ridden my mental state is, at some point I always waft away like jasmine on a balmy midnight breeze. I never remember those intangible few seconds suspended between drifting and falling asleep. My consciousness wanes like sand filtering through my fingers. The next thing I know, Im squinting at the sunlight peeking through the blinds, trying to recall how I finally drifted off.  And then I realize, like most things, that its out of my control. I can wear the right pajamas, position myself perfectly, listen to a mixologist make the perfect Old Fashioned, manage every tiny little detail possible, but in the end, things operate on their own clock. They sneak up on you and you lose sight of how you got there.  There are things way bigger than us, bigger than our fears, our worries or our insomnia. They come and go as they please, but nothing ever stays the same. I think, now more than ever, we are all coming to terms with that notion. Accepting that wont help me start snoring as soon as my head hits the pillow, but itll remind me that eventually, if we keep moving forward, somewhere down the line, things will change.  Just like waking from a deep sleep, at some point during this overwhelming time we find ourselves in, well open our eyes and see the sun again. And when that day comes, feel free to play Taylor Swift as loud as you want."
vacation,"I now it not mine ok So hear it is Ever wondered what the person at the front desk is really thinking when checking you into a hotel? I spoke with half a dozen current and former hotel front desk staffers who shared their pet peeves, offered insider advice, and revealed how (and how) to get an upgrade. Below are nine important things to know.Youve probably hit up the hotel front desk for simple toiletry items you left at home, but Sarah Dandashy, who serves as concierge at the London West Hollywood at Beverly Hills and blogs atAsk a Concierge, notes that many properties have a whole treasure trove of other things you can request. Her list includes phone chargers, adapters, safety pins, umbrellas, Band-Aids, tampons, nail files, hair ties, lint rollers, razors, and, funny enough, earplugs. Every hotel varies, but Ive even loaned out bow ties and cufflinks!Samantha Firth ofTravelling King, who spent five years behind the front desks at various Hilton, Hyatt, and Four Seasons properties, notes that many hotels offer pillow menus that arent always advertised in the rooms. She also says some properties offer hair straighteners, pod-style coffee machines, and even PlayStation consoles for kids.RELATED:9 Surprising Free Hotel AmenitiesMultiple staffers told me that guests demanding early access to their rooms was among the biggest pet peeves of hotel front desk employees. Yes, we know youre a platinum member who travels 350 million days a year, but we cant go around waking up guests to get you a room, says Stephanie Rodriguez, Front Office Manager atResidence Inn/Courtyard by Marriott Phoenix Downtown.If the room is ready, we will grant early accessafter all, we want to provide a good service, says Pedro Richardson ofTravel with Pedro, who worked in the hotel industry for 12 years. But this is not always possible due to high occupancy the previous night.It can help to let the hotel know in advance when youll be arriving, advises Richardson; that way the staff can prioritize the cleaning of your room. But this strategy isnt foolproof.If you know youre going to be really tired on arrival and want a guarantee that youll be able to check in right away, book the room from the night before and inform the hotel youll be arriving in the night or the early morning, says Cat Ekkelboom-White ofWe Are the Wanderers, who spent four years working at the front desk of a hotel in Innsbruck, Austria. That way, you know your room will be ready and waiting for you.While upgrades, discounts, and perks are never guaranteed, the hotel front desk staffers I spoke with say it never hurts to ask. If the guest calls the hotel to make a booking and simply asks for a better rate nicely and politely, many will be prepared to offer a small discount, says Richardson. Its that simple.Dandashy agrees: The power of asking nicely is huge! Just be sure to communicate if you are there for aspecial occasion and ask for what you are looking for. Being specific helps. Ask if youd like a room upgrade, or if they can send up complimentary chocolate-covered strawberries and Champagne for special occasions. Front desk agents get asked for things all the time. Just be straightforward and nice, and they might even throw in another amenity!Not all hotel front desk staffers are equally empowered to dole out things like free amenities, room credits, or upgrades. If you feel like the front desk is a little limited in what they can offer, you can always politely ask for a manager, says Dandashy.For best results, put your request in as early as possiblepreferably during your initial booking. It helps the hotel to know in advance that youre hoping for birthday Champagne or that youd prefer a room away from the elevators.RELATED:How to Get a Hotel Upgrade for FreeShopping around online for the cheapest possible rate might land you the price youre looking for, but it will also likely score you a lesser room. Not every booking platform is offering the same quality of rooms, Ekkelboom-White warns. If you see a double room on two different websites for two different prices and they seem to be the same, the more expensive one is likely to be a better room.If you travel frequently to a particular city, its worth staying in the same place each time and developing a relationship with the hotel front desk staff there. Richardson says that regular guests often get extra perks: All hotels where I worked had a program where the guest would get a treat every five stays, or every few days if it was a long stay (more than a week).Firth notes that regular guests are often first in line for upgrades if a hotel overbooks a particular room category.Most guests know to tip the concierge and the housekeeper, but it might not occur to you to leave a few bucks for the person who checks you in at the front desk. If a front desk agent was able to do something extra to make your stay an amazing one, give them a tip as a thank you, recommends Dandashy. My rule of thumb for tipping: Tip AFTER an agent (or anyone) has helped you. A tip beforehand seems like a bribe. But a tip afterward is a lovely thing.RELATED:A Guide to Tipping Across the Globe, in One MapAs noted above, its useful to point out if youre celebrating a special occasion or simply to ask politely for an upgrade if one becomes available. It doesnt hurt to get creative either: The best way to get your way is to be niceor come bearing chocolates, says Rodriguez.Firth concurs: Cookies are great bribes!Whats not so useful are rude behaviors such as making demands (instead of asking) and acting as though your loyalty status or your job title (Im a CEO!) entitles you to endless perks.Hotel staffers also dont take kindly to manipulation. I have handled a few guests who eagerly search for shortfalls in a hotel while seeking perks, says Mokshta Chauhan, who blogs atMiss with Migratory Wingsand has worked at five different hotels in India. Theyll say something like, Your bedsheet has a stain; this is not acceptable in a hotel of this class. [You can make up for it] by upgrading me to one of your suites.'When I asked front desk workers about the worst guest behavior theyve encountered, they came up with some doozies. Richardson once had a guest who threw a hissy fit over a dysfunctional keycard: The guest broke the keycard in front of me, [screamed profanities], and threw the card pieces on my face.Chauhan had a bad encounter with a guest who had to wait an hour to get into his room due to high occupancy. When I approached this guest and handed over the key to him, apologizing for the wait, he replied, Im not happy with that apology. He wanted me to feel miserable for making him wait and demanded that I apologize to each of his family members. Chauhan did so, but the guest still wasnt satisfied. He pointed his finger at her and told her not to show her face to him for the duration of his stay.Firth not-so-fondly recalls a drunken guest who smashed a glass table in his room and threatened to sue the hotel if it wasnt cleaned up within five minutes. The guest refused to be moved to another room (he was also offered an upgrade). The general manager had to be called in as the guest become highly abusive, screaming and shouting in the lobby while sitting on the floor in a puddle of his own urine.RELATED:Travel Etiquette: 5 Controversial Rules You Might Be ViolatingWhile most guests arent as boorish as the ones above, hotel front desk workers see their fair share of rude behaviorso theyll often go the extra mile for guests who are friendly and kind.The job isnt an easy one, says Dandashy. We stand on our feet all day, and we work unconventional hours and even most holidays. Sometimes its hard to even take a break in the middle of a busy day, and we find ourselves running to the back office to scarf down a bite to eat in five minutes or less. So be kind.

The Merrow: An Irish Fable,"Liam looked out over the calm sea and prepared his nets for the day ahead; the skies looked promising except for some gray, low hanging clouds far out to sea. 	Aye, let this be a good day, he muttered, My press is as empty as a scoundrels heart. Mother, he looked skyward could ye see fit to bring me a wee bit of good luck today? He often spoke thus to his beloved mother who had sung to him as a boy and told wonderful stories of Irish folklore. He was particularly fond of those tales which spoke of the merrow and morgens, enchanted mermaids and sea sprites, who occasionally encountered seafaring folk like themselves. 	Shouldnt fill the lads head with such nonsense. His would scold his mother lovingly, sea life is hard enough. 	Ah, true, shed say, sea life is difficult, and we havent much, but love, ah love conquers all. The stories and his mothers beautiful singing filled Liams heart and built a strong bond between them.	When influenza struck their small village, it took his mother when Liam was in his early teens. The pain of her loss struck the boy and his father hard, but they carried on as best they could. The boy learned the ways of the sea from his father, who passed away himself, only a few years later. His passing left Liam alone in their small cottage by the sea. 	The sea became his life. From his earliest memories he recalled helping his father with their currach, oiling the small fishing boat, repairing nets, preparing bait, studying the clouds for impending weather and the many simple tasks which made possible wresting a simple life from the seas bounty. His father had taught him that the sea could be a loving mother, caressing, cool and comforting or as cruel as any childhood fables hag, temperamental and threatening, powerful and irascible.	He set out to sea, ignoring the distant clouds. The storm had come up quickly as many small tempests did in this part of the ocean. A massive school of fish passing his boat had distracted him. He had never seen such a rich array of fish, schools one following another. He had labored fiercely with his nets to keep up, hauling in the catch, one after another. This had gone on for hours. He lost track of time and place, greedily seizing from the sea this unexpected catch. It would be a grand payday ashore.	Finally, he collapsed on the deck of his boat exhausted. Only then did he discover with alarm, how far he had drifted from his customary course. The clouds threatened an ominous storm. In fifteen minutes, the seas rose sharply. The sky begun pelting his small craft with walls of water. Then, from nowhere, a phantom wave lifted his boat like a great hand and dashed it into a deep trough between the waves. He felt his boat tear apart at amidships tumbling him into the sea. That had seemed hours ago. He clung to an empty piece of floating debris and kept afloat with a Herculean effort, part conscious part unconsciously. Liam was finally swept ashore in the night, on one of the small anonymous isles which dotted the sea.	In the dark, as his senses gradually returned, his focus fell upon his hands and aching limbs. . Then, Liam was distracted by the sound of music floating faintly in the air. It was a high-pitched sound, a cry like that of a child, or was it a song? It seemed like a familiar melody, echoing in the breeze from the darkness of the island beyond.	Hello, whos there? he called. His voice was unintelligible, a croak more than words. In reply, came nothing but the musical sound and the wind. He rolled onto his side and slowly disentangled himself from the rope handle of the locker. His hands, in excruciating pain, twisted this way and that to free himself. The roar of the surf filled his ears and he felt himself slowly ebbing in strength. He knew he could not pass out this close to the seas tide. He hauled himself on his elbows and knees laboriously up the beach, the sea sucking at the sand beneath him as he crawled toward the interior of the island, toward the sound he had heard invisible in the darkness.	Finally, exhausted, he lay on dry sand, perhaps only ten yards from the surf, but as far as his strength could carry him. Then, he heard the sound again, a singsong voice drifting to him in the breeze. 	Help me, a small voice cried, , help me, please	Liam rolled onto his side, the sand grating against his skin, Whos there? he called. 	There was no answer. He crawled another few yards and his hand encountered an object buried in the sand. It was smooth, firm to the touch. Liam traced his fingers along the exterior, feeling an irregularly patterned, textured covering. He found that it extended several feet sideways to his outstretched arm. Beneath the sand, the trunk of the object felt as if it flattened out like a wide tail or a fin. It was like the fin of a great fish.	The sky was pitch black except for an occasional star winking through the passing clouds. With no moon or light of any kind he tentatively let his hand stray along the object in the opposite direction. As he stretched his hand along the figure, the firm scaly fin merged into soft velvety skin. As his fingers traced the skin from the tail, the form shifted beneath his hand.  	He felt a shiver as he slid his hand up the skin, realizing it was the back of a woman. Long tresses of silken hair now slid through his fingers. Then the creature spoke.	Please sir, I beg you, do me no harm. I need only be returned to the sea, which is my home. For this, I will grant you any three wishes your heart may desire.	Liam was stunned. He momentarily forgot his pain, hunger and thirst. He was spellbound by the sudden realization he had happened upon a live mermaid. He squinted into the pitch blackness but still could see nothing of the creature before him. 	Are you real? Liam croaked, his voice strained from weakness. I cant see you.	As real as you are, the creature replied. Her voice was ethereal, a soothing, mellifluous lilt. When the dawn breaks, you will find water and sustenance. But before the sun fully emerges I must be returned to the sea. The storm washed me far ashore and I have become trapped on the land. Will you help me?	Liam, his spirits buoyed by her beautiful voice, responded.  I have little strength after my ordeal, but twill be a pleasure to do as you ask.	He once again traced his hand along the merrows skin and found that her fin had become entangled in the roots of a large trunk of driftwood. He tore at the roots which bound her and after a short struggle he was able to free her.	He didnt know how he found the strength, but Liam managed to stand. He carefully scooped the merrow up in his arms and carried her back toward the sound of the surf pounding against the shore. He bore her into the sea until he was waist deep and gently let her go.	By now he saw the light shimmering at the horizon as the sun was rising in the eastern sky. Before him was the merrow, swimming and frolicking in the sea, ten or so yards away. Looking at the beach as the light illuminated his surroundings, he saw a small spring of fresh water gently cascading down a rocky elevation. He waded to shore and greedily drank his fill, feeling strength return to his body.	I have promised you three wishes to repay your kindness and that shall be your reward, the merrow sang as she called up to Liam, now languishing on the sand.	Well, to be safely home to my friends and simple cottage, that would be my first wish, Liam replied with a smile.	That you shall have, she replied sweetly and what else would you want?	Well, I suppose, to be rich and successful beyond my wildest dreams, to own anything my heart desires, he laughed. Is that not what every man dreams?	Done, she responded with a smile, And your final wish?	Liam looked at the merrow, who now in the dawn of the brightening sky was more beautiful than anything he had ever seen. Her pale skin shone in the gathering light and her sea green tresses bobbed on the waters surface.	I have no wife, with whom to share these things, Liam began. For my third wish, I want you to come with me, to my home, be my lifelong love and companion. This would bring me the greatest joy. The creature looked at him sadly. The first two wishes I can grant, but a union between man and merrow can never be. We are from separate worlds and are meant to be of different forms. 	Nonsense! Liam insisted Love can conquer all, m ma always told me. You be my wife and be cast in human form.  is my hearts desire!	Very well, the mermaid replied, in her soft, lilting voice.	Liam opened his eyes. He found himself lying in bed, rich satin sheets and fine linens covering him. About him he recognized his simple fishermans cottage, but now transformed. Everywhere he looked he saw piles of gold coins and jewels and the finest furnishings he could imagine. He was home and wealthy beyond imagination! Then his bedroom door opened and the merrow, now a beautiful woman, cloaked in rich, luxurious raiment, entered the room.	Good morning, husband, she sang sweetly, in that voice he heard in his dreams, I hope you are feeling well. How shall we spend this fine day? Perhaps, down by the seashore?	My wonderful, loving wife. Nothing would please me more. Let us first breakfast and then celebrate our new life together.	Liams heart swelled with joy and wonder at his good fortune. He threw aside his covers and bent to swing his legs over the bedside. Only then did he realize, that below his waist he bore a long, silver scaly fin, which twitched gently as he beheld it."
Love Never Dies,"Love Never Dies  I will surely find them, I resolved to myself because Miss Suman has instructed strictly that tomorrow is the last date for project submission. When she says she means it and would never forgive anyone. I usually finish my work on the very day it is assigned but this time my favorite team has reached FIFA Finals for the first time so how could I miss this. The project was almost finish but was waiting for the designs that mummy was supposed to give me. My sweet mother is a fabulous fashion designer so she promised to give her designs for project to make it more exquisite but unfortunately she had misplaced. That is why I resolved to search them. She is a busy entrepreneur, leaves home for office on my arrival from school and comes back late nights. In her absence my caretaker cum best friend- Mrs. Anna gives her immense affection. She use to narrate her anecdotes , some fun facts and many more, in short she is a live encyclopedia for me. After reaching home I asked mummy for the designs Oh! Dear , she replied, I am a bit busy can you please check in my wooden cupboard. Yes, certainly. I ran to cupboard and searched well but was unsuccessful. I was about to close the cupboard but suddenly something pulled me towards the cupboard. I realized that my locket was twisted around the button of mom s one coat which was hanging, I carefully untangled it but my eyes fell on a shiny substance I pulled it out and saw, it was a portrait of a young handsome man framed in gold and silver work on it. Bye sweetie, take care, see you soon, luva lova mummy said. I opened my mouth for asking who is this person. Some other photographs and album fascinated me so much that I just replied, Bye mummy, luva lova. Luva lova is just a phrase used by mummy and me to signify love and neither me nor she knows whether it is meaningful or not. I pulled all the stuff out and started admiring the photos. In most of the photos the man ( which was in frame) was with mom. I thought he might be any relative but one pic of that man, mom, one boy and me amazed me because mummy never mentioned about any brother, till my knowledge I have only two cousin sisters. This totally perplexed me. I ran my hands through face and neck and felt that locket was no more in my neck. I found it under the bed and the pendant was into halves, on one side mummys and on other the mans photo was there this added to my astonishment. With all the evidences, I rushed towards Anna ,she was cleaning the dishes,I  shown her the frame and asked about the frame, photos and my locket. She saw surprisingly, again continued her chore and ignored me. I pleaded, Please tell, Amma. Who is he? I have never seen him. Is he your new teacher? she replied. I knew she was hiding something. Amma, Amma I know you him please tell na I requested again and again. She is bad at digesting secrets. He is your father she cried the boy is your real elder brother Karna Santu. Oh! Papa. I have never seen his photograph. May God bless him RI....... No he is alive. Never say this again. she interrupted. But mummy told he met with an acc....... No..no.. it was a legal divorce of two love birds.she exclaimed. Please tell the whole incident amma She narrated, Mrs. Santu and Mr. Santu studied in same college and were known as love birds. Their were leading a very peaceful and lovely life after marriage but one day, you were probably one or two years, Mrs. Santu was driving the car with your aunt. They used to have very bitter fights in home and everyone knew that their relation was not good. That day they met with an accident and unfortunately your aunt was badly injured, lying at the boundary of life and death. Mrs. Santu was also injured but not that deeply by Gods sake. When your aunt came in consciousness she irrelevantly claimed that your mother tried to kill her. Being the most loved everyone agreed without giving a second thought. They decided to push Mrs. Santu out from home. No mum can not do this even in her worst situation she cant."" I cried, What about papa he did not raise his voice?  he also had unbreakable believe on your mother but not had any strong evidence against a live witness. We both were in tears on this heartbreaking separation. Oh! I sighed  I have a real brother too his name Karan Santu. Hmmm...I have heard this name before. Where?.....Yes, in the school assembly. Amma he is our schools Head boy I should talk to him. She promised not to tell mummy anything. In all this I forgot about the project. Next day in school prayer I was just praying two things: one Head boy must be present and Miss Suman should be on leave or else I have to stand outside the class. By Gods grace both were fulfilled Miss Suman was on leave for a week. In recess I ran to XII-D to meet my brother. ""Hello . Do you know her? I asked him hesitantly showing mothers photo in pendant. He said Yes, of course, from where you got it?"" I am Kanu Santu, I replied. By listening my name he broke out in tears and hugged me tightly. I was six when I last saw you. he exclaimed. We discussed the whole matter and I asked some question about papa also. My dear, whats going on your mind? Spit it out fast. He said. Well, Papa is physician in Rajeev Nagar, na."" YesTomorrow I will be there with mummy be ready in clinic about 3 pm. Bye.. The next day was Sunday means holiday for mom. So I requested her to take me to Rajeev park just for enjoyment. The park was just opposite to papas clinic. When there was no patient in clinic. I pretended that my stomach was paining bitterly. She searched and saw papas clinic she did not remember this clinic so went for a check-up. As we entered in the clinic mummy saw papa. I dragged her to papa. Both of them were nostalgic and crying. I hugged papa. I am Kanu I could not say anything and just kissed him. Mummy was quiet so I thought I have made it...but mom pulled me out from papas arm. Do not be smart and stay away from my child she yelled. We were suppose to leave then bhaiya came and hugged mummy. I thought she will stop now but she freed herself and moved forward. No mummy No please understand.....I cried. We sat in car and marched towards home since afternoon mother closed her room and was bitterly crying. I realizsed this was not a good idea. Instantly an another idea crept in my head but this was risky and the final chance to reunite parents. I rushed towards landline called Karan bhaiya. Hello, how is father is he well. Here mummy is bitterly crying.Papa, also cried and now disappointed. Whats next?An idea to reunite, them but should be careful this time. You write an apology letter on behalf of papa to mummy requesting her to meet in Love is Growing Caf at 6pm and here I will write on behalf of mom. I believe that they still love each other and need some time to spent lonelyOkay, DoneWe did as decided when papas post came nor me neither Amma went to receive the post so mummy went to receive but she tore into pieces. I was observing all this from the side of wall. I ran to her and said, Please one try for me. Please. As always she accepted and went to caf. After this, Amma and I reached to caf through auto rickshaw. We were not able to hear anything but it seemed like a healthy conversation. Finally we won the day!! We all had a happy family hug. ""Naughty boy, from you came to know about all this?""Before I could say anything Amma came and smiled. Mummy understood that she has told me. then i also realized that i had not opened the wooden rather opened the iron Amirah- which was not allowed. Thank God!!!This day brings us to present day of all love and affection.-By Bodhini Jain"
My high school love life,"It was wintertime. Everybody loves wintertime, don't they? Making a snowman, snow fights, having fun, maybe having chat with friends that was all needed to escape away from the boring world we're living in. I wanted no different than that, but everybody doesn't get what they wanted in their life. It was like any other regular day of my life, or at least I thought it was.The day was pleasant like any other day of winter. Whatever, I didn't like being there at school felt like I was in some kind of solitary confinement. Rules, punctuation, discipline, homework, Feels like living the same day over and over again. Although it was very bright outside, my mind was full of darkness. I actually never wanted to be here at school, but the place where I live requires me to complete at least 12th grade to even get a driving license. Was I in school just for my future driving license? Kind of, yes. Actually, my mom sent me there to get a good education. I did not want to disappoint my mom after all so I was at school just for my mom. With this much of a problem on my side, I had never even considered anything about getting the love of my life at the worst phase of my life. But boy, was I wrong. Later that day, as I was passing my time staring at an empty space. A new student was called by the teacher. She was told to introduce herself. I still remembered to this day, she said,"" My name is LARA, I am a new student here, It will be a pleasure studying with you guys. She was so beautiful that I was mesmerized by her presence in the class. The class was looking like a monster to be looking at an angle. Everybody wanted her to sit on their bench, so all of the boys spare a little space for her to sit. I was sitting alone on the last bench. Without considering other benches, she came near me and said excuse me, I didn't answer I was too nervous to speak. I slide aside for giving her some space to sit. The class which felt like hours felt like a couple of seconds to me. Other days I would be staring at empty space while today I am looking at her eyes. Her eyes felt like the blue romantic ocean I just felt like somebody threw a bucket of water to my face, I was no longer wondering anything at all instead of her. She asked me ""hello, you alright, hi myself Lara and you?"" she waved her hand for a handshake but I let her down by showing no gesture or any reply. Some days went by, but I never managed to talk to her as I came late and leave early. One day while I was walking home, alone from school for the whole day staring at her like a creep, I heard someone say, ""hey"" from a little far away. I didn't look back. This time the voice was louder like the caller was near. I looked behind, and it was Lara. I got surprised and shocked at the same time. I was scared she was here to confess about how I was staring at her the whole day.She just said, ""Hi, are you fine"" I shook my head. She introduced me to her one more time, just like she did on the first day. ""What's your name?"" she asked. I just stood there thinking nothing but blank, for some seconds then I said I'm k.. ken. She raised her hand and said, ""hi ken, nice to meet you."" I nervously moved my hand towards her and said, ""Nice to meet you too."" We both shook our hands and walks along with our own ways. From that day I started talking with her in school.I became best friends with her and our friends took to the next level and soon we found ourselves bound within a relationship. The day has come to our graduation. That day I was really nervous and she was as chilled as ice. While the names were being announced I was praying to get graduated. It felt like the announcer spoke some magical words, It was my name and I finally got graduated as well as she. During our college, we both turned 18. We both had a pretty good job while in college. It was the time I finally proposed to her. I was nervous my hands were shaking. My voice was low It was the time I finally gathered courage and kneel down and propose to her with the ring. She only spoke one word, Yes. I cried tears of joy and felt extremely happy for the first time in my life. Eventually, we got legally married. It was not like we had no problems, but we had each other till forever so no problem ever made us cry.We were only legally married we never had a celebration so we decided to do a small marriage celebration. On the day of the celebration, I was going to surprise my mom, I got a call that she sadly passed away due to a heart attack. I was Shortly after, we adopted 2 twin daughters and had a biological son. we never treat any of our children unfairly. We serve the organization for more than 40 years. we were already grandparents by then so we retired. Now I consider myself lucky to have grandparents like you."" Now I am telling them stories right now"", grandpa laughs and told the grandchildren. ""But you didn't tell us the whole story"", It was many years ago,"" I don't remember them all but what was the moral of the story?"", grandpa asked.Grandma, who was also listening to the story said, ""Loving can be quite hard sometimes, but if you managed to hold each other's hand until the rest of your life, you will always be happy no matter any problem comes by.""The grandpa smiled and kissed grandma on the forehead.A couple of Ken and Lara is still as beautiful as it was."
Fiddler's Dinner,"Fiddler was making dinner. He first washed his tiny paws, then clipped back his whiskers so they wouldn't fall in the soup. After ushering the twins out of the kitchen, as they were more nuisance than help, he got out the ingredients and his mother's old cookbook. It was his father's wedding anniversary, and Fiddler had been presented with the task of preparing a romantic meal for him and his wives. You see, Fiddler's father, Tiddler, had five wives. From what he had told his son, he had gotten five proposals on Christmas Eve and accepted every single one. Fiddler wondered why he hadn't just chosen one mouse instead of all five, but whatever the reason, there was a dinner to be made.  Fiddler flipped through his mother's cookbook, which had been passed down through her family for centuries. Though his father had married five mice, Fiddler only had one mother, a beautiful white mouse named Delilah. She was also the mom of his three brothers and sisters. Fiddler's eyes rested on a few particularly delicious recipes he had cooked many times before. Fiddler had become the family cook after he presented his first dish, cheese n' peanut casserole. He was exceptionally good at making food, hence his father's requestthat he prepare the anniversary supper. He had chosen an acorn and cheese soup for the appetizer, almond mozzarella pasta for the main course, and for dessert there would be raspberry sorbet with a special nutty sauce. As for drinks, there would be lemonade. Fiddler made delicious lemonade.  Just as Fiddler was getting out the cheese (which, he was quite ashamed to admit, had been stolen from thehuman's pantry) one of his father's wives entered the kitchen. She was brown all over, and her name was Shell. It was a rather unfitting name, Fiddler thought, because shells were beautiful and this mouse was anything but. She was most likely the fattest mouse in the history of mice, and her face was bulbous as if it was always stuffed with food.  ""How's them dinner coming along?"" She asked gruffly, pushing Fiddler aside to look inside the bowl he was using. He had only just put diced acorns in it.  ""I've just started,"" Fiddler said, annoyed.  ""Mm..."" Shell popped a piece of acorn in her mouth and chewed loudly. ""How long 'fore it's done?"" She swallowed with a cringeworthy dry gulp.  Fiddler quickly calculated the prepping and cooking times in his head. ""About three hours,"" he said, grabbing a wood splinter and slicing cheese.  ""Make it two."" Shell turned around abruptly (taking a whole log of cheese as she passed) and exited the room. Fiddler sighed as he sliced more cheese and melted it, mixing it with water and adding fresh herbs that he had picked that afternoon. Shell was his least favorite mouse in the entire mouse-hole. She was pushy and gruffand acted like she owned the place, even though her husband was the one who was really in charge. She claimed to have married Tiddler so he wouldn't be alone, but in truth she was there for the food. Fiddler's food.  Fiddler had taken up cooking not only because he enjoyed it, but because he wanted to be useful to his family. He was the underdog, the least loved child. He thought over this as he sprinkled nutmeg over his soup as it simmered, tasting the savory cheesiness and adding more salt. All his brothers and sisters were older than him, and much more attractive. His whiskers were stubby and his tail too long, so much that it got tangled up in the furniture as he walked past. But if there was one good thing about Fiddler, it was that he could cook.  Fiddler thought as he brought out stolen flour to make noodles.  He took out water, oil, salt and eggs and mixed them up with the flour to make dough, then shaped them into pasta shapes. Noodle-making was one of Fiddler's favorite things to do. He loved to experiment with the shapes and sizes, to make new patterns anddesigns. He once went through the trouble to make little mouse shaped pasta, although those didn't turn out so well.  Fiddler sighed once more as he ladled the completed soup into six bowls. There was just enough left for him, and he stored it away for later. He wouldn't give any to his siblings. If they were nicer to him, then he might, but his brothers and sisters were possibly even crueler than Shell. They hogged his parents' attention and gotthe most birthday presents. They pulled out his short whiskers and tread on his tail when he wouldn't make them breakfast fast enough.   Fiddler thought sadly as he started on the pasta sauce.  *** A few hours later, the dinner was ready. The soup was reheated and topped with parsley; the pasta was letting out a mouthwatering aroma of almonds and cheese, and the raspberry sorbet waspractically glowing in little wooden saucers. After pouring ice-cold lemonade into cups, Fiddler placed the soup carefully on a tray and carried it into the dining room, where his father and the five wives were waiting.  Tiddler was at the head of the table, back straight and whiskers neatly brushed. A little bow tie was around his neck, and his five wedding rings were on his tail. Closest to him was Delilah, his favorite wife and lifelong companion. Shell was next, patting her stomach. Sitting at the other end of the table were the two sisters, both grey and black mice with an endless supply of energy. And then there was Rah-Mouse, a skinny spotted creature who neither liked nor disliked anybody.  ""Finally,"" Shell moaned as Fiddler served the soup. He resisted the urge to roll his eyes.  ""It looks lovely,, Twiddler,"" Delilah said absentmindedly as she pulled the soup closer to her. Fiddler lowered his eyes.  ""I'm Fiddler, Mother,"" he corrected her gently. Her eyes widened and she smiled apologetically. She had mistaken him for his older brother.  Fiddler left the adults to their soup and wandered into his father's bedroom. He wasn't entirely sure why, as he should be back in the kitchen and making sure the sorbet didn't melt. But his body had other ideas. Fiddler crawled over to the small wooden box at thefoot of his father's bed and opened it. He was never allowed to open this box, as it held Tiddler's most personal items. But Fiddler was curious, and this was his only chance to have a quick peek. The adults, after all, were all occupied, and his siblings had gone out for the day.  He opened the lid. Surprisingly, there were only three items inside: a letter, a framed picture, and a tuxedo. He brought out the letter and skimmed it over. It was written by his father's mother, Fiddler's late grandmother. He expected it to be deeply personal, and filled with motherly love, but instead it was written in a businesslike manner, describing happenings at home and news on some cat's sickness. It wasn't anything interesting. Why had his father kept it? The tuxedo was next. Fiddler suspected that it belonged to his grandfather, the late Dwindler Whiskerkin. He was famous in his time, good at composing poetry. Fiddler set aside the tuxedo fondly. He had always liked his grandfather, and was very sad when he died.  Now for the picture. Fiddler found it to be extremely heavy and dusty, and first had to rub the dirt off with his tail before he could see the photograph clearly. It was a scene from his father's wedding, and it was quite a funny picture. Tiddler looked verysmart in his fathers tuxedo. Fiddler glanced back at the suit in the box. So, Tiddler had worn it to his wedding.  In a straight line in front of Tiddler were his five wives, all wearing white gowns and a single ring on their tails. Shell's overlarge stomach bulged out of her dress, the sisters looked bored from sitting so still, and Rah-Mouse's face was expressionless.  But it was Delilah's face that struck Fiddler. Her eyes were filled with love and hope, of happiness and wonder. She was gazing up at Tiddler, and he gazed down back at her with the same loving expression. He wasn't bothered by the other four wives that he wasforced to marry. He only cared about her.  Fiddler felt tears roll down his face. All his life, he had been seemingly unloved by his parents, pushed around by Shell and harassed by his siblings. All he wanted was that love, the love that he saw in the wedding photo. If only someone loved him that much, he would be happy. So, so happy.  Yes, it would happen. But not yet."

The unlikely historian,"Usually when he took the bus Cliff would be sitting in the middle beside Rosa. This was the 1950s so segregation was still a thing. Normally when someone black would sit in the front of the bus the bus driver would immediately tell them to move to towards the back. Rosa and Cliff were friends for years and she would always have fresh baked muffins for him to try as she would create different flavors such as; oatmeal raisin, blueberry, banana nut, and strawberry. On this particular day Cliff just so happened to sit at the back of the bus and not the middle as he had gotten a bad feeling as he was about to sit down in the middle. When the bus came to the next stop Rosa got on and sat on the middle and looked back and waved at Cliff but she didnt have any muffin today which was weird because she loved to bake and share them with her friends. The day before Rosa had gotten into a small argument with her husband because she started hanging around a young minister named Martin Luther King who was also married but Rosas husband didnt like the fact that they had increasingly started to hang around each other as well as the rest of the group and it was starting to take up most of her time. They had started a small council of people who would try to implement change towards how blacks were treated in the world and they were also in talks about starting a movement. The reason Rosa didnt have any muffins that day was because she and Dr King were on the phone most of the nigh talking about different plans to put into motion but neither of them would realize that there plan would be in motion as sooner than expected. Robert stopped the story he was telling his grand-kids so he could use the bathroom and when he got back hey were gone. They had went downstairs and got themselves some snacks. When they came back after a few minutes Robert had suddenly fell asleep in the chair with his head tilted sideways. The kids laughed and decided to prank him by wrapping toilet paper around his head and pouring hot sauce into his open mouth. After pouring the hot sauce in his mouth he awoke and startled them as he knocked the bottle to the ground as the glass broke and hot sauce was leaking from the side of his mouth. He stood up, started screaming erratically about how hot his mouth was and immediately ran to the kitchen to drink some water and milk. After he was done he cursed the kids and told them to clean up the mess or he would get his belt and if they didnt know anything else they knew that grandpa Robert would whoop them if they didnt listen. The kids finished cleaning up the glass and wasted hot sauce and while they were cleaning Robert had moved to the living room and started watching a show on the TV. They told him they were done and aggravated him until he continued the story because even though they were young they liked hearing about the civil rights movement. Robert sighed and said fine. So Robert picked up where he left off. The day after the night Rosa talked to Mr. King on the phone, the next morning Rosa and her husband had an argument and because of it she didnt have time to bake her muffins. The bus stopped and Rosa got on and Cliff could see she was irritated and didnt want to ask why she chose to sit in the middle of the bus rather than at the back. The bus proceeded to the next stop that would affect the entire world for years to come. The bus stopped and a group of white people got on and even though there were open seats towards the front of the bus they felt entitled and every chance they got they would use that privilege against blacks because at that time the segregation laws were in effect. So the went towards the middle of the bus and asked the blacks that were sitting there to move and almost all of them did but one and her name was Rosa Parks. She refused to move and hey looked at each other and threatened her. She replied and said that there were enough seats for them to sit down beside her or they could use the seats towards the front that were unoccupied and they were in disbelief. The bus driver hadnt moved yet and decided to call the police because he was outraged. The police came and ask her to move and she again refused. After 30minutes they decided to arrest her for civil disobedience. At that time not many people spoke out towards the disrespect endured to black people, mostly because of what happened to Emmett Till a few months earlier. He didnt want to give them a horrid visual so he just told them that Emmett Till was a 14year old boy who was lynched by a couple of white guys because he said something to a white girl and his mother had an open casket funeral to show the public what happened to her son. He told them that many people believe that these events started the civil rights movement but it wasnt true but those events did spark an uprising that made it happen a lot sooner than planned. The next day after he found out Rosa was in jail Dr. King led a march through down the streets of Albany, Georgia. The kids stopped him and asked how did he know what happened on the bus and it wasnt in the history books and he told them that he was one of the man that had moved out his seat for the white man. Then they stated that how come he didnt stay like Rosa and he said that the only reason Rosa stayed was because she was mad at her husband and she wasnt in a charitable mood. After the march a boycott was started and it went on for over a year in which Rosa had lost her job but they said it wasnt because of her incident but anybody who believed that would be foolish. Robert stopped the story and told them that for the next part they would need to know that he was a deacon in the church at the time and wasnt on board with the nonviolent approach by Dr. King and that he often sided with Malcolm X and his approach on defending yourself by any means necessary. When he was a young boy he had got in trouble for striking a white officer who grabbed his mother by the arm and he was struck hard in the side of the head by a baton. The kids sympathized for a minute and asked for him to continue the story. Of course he sighed. He began and said in 1956 Dr. King had sent out letters for the deacons and reverends of black churches to meet in Atlanta, Georgia but he denied him at first until he saw what effect the non-violence approach was having on society and it was actually sparking change as more people stepped up. So in January of 1957 he decided to go to the meeting but ended up being a day late but Dr. King welcomed him anyway because he was ecstatic that Robert had changed his mind. The meeting was to coordinate protests across the country. After the meeting Dr. King had asked him to stay a while longer so they could chat and he asked what made Robert change his mind. Robert replied that he saw how society was slowly changing and he wanted to be a part of that change. After talking with him some more Robert and Dr. King parted ways but as Robert was getting in his car Martin stopped him and asked if he would like to grab a bite to eat with him and his wife. Now Robert didnt feel comfortable being a third wheel and he still was uneasy about the decision to join the non-violent cause but what happened during the dinner changed his life forever. The kids were now tuned completely in as they wanted to hear more about the life changing experience Robert had with Dr. King. He met the kings at the restaurant and they were talking having a good time when a lady came over to join them. Robert described her as the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She had on a long red dress with the hairstyle of Bette McLaurin who was a songstress at the time. The lady was a friend of Ms. King; her name was Lynnette. The kids awed because Lynnette was their grandmothers name who had just passed a few months ago which is why Robert was now staying with them. He stood up and kissed her hand and told her how beautiful she was. What Robert didnt know at the time was that Dr. King had set this up within the hour. After his conversation with Robert at the meeting and inviting him, he called his wife and asked her to invite her friend that was visiting. Many people dont know but Dr. King was a match maker thanks to his wife. During the dinner the conversation shifted from the four off them talking to just Robert and Lynette conversing and then they decided to dance together and during that dance is when he told his grand-kids he knew they would be together forever because no woman had ever gotten him to dance in public the way he was at the time. He had completely forgotten about the good Dr. and was purely focused on the gorgeous lady he was with. After that night he and Martin had become close friends, so close that he was promoted to one of the head leaders in Dr. Kings circle. Two major events happened in September of that year; the first was the little rock nine were blocked from integrating into central high school and a few days later president Eisenhower signed the civil rights act of 1957 which allowed federal prosecution of those who suppressed anothers right to vote. In December of the same year Robert proposed to Lynette and she said yes. They married in June the following year. On January 29 of 1960 he was speaking at a college campus in Greensboro, North Carolina to a group of students which inspired the event of the days to follow. On February 1 four students from the campus refused to leave a whites only lunch counter without being served. That event became known as the Greensboro sit in. More events happened over the next 3 years that were sparked by the overwhelming publicity from the movement and everyone knew they were a part of something great. August 28 of 1963 Robert marched beside Martin along with 250,000 people in the march on Washington to deliver his speech I have a dream speech. Robert urged against the march in the days before because police officers were getting more violent but stayed to support his friend. After the speech they took a picture together. Sadly though he explained to his grand-kids that sometimes when something great happens it is followed by disaster and thats what happened as on September 15 a few weeks after the speech a church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama that killed 4 young girls and injured many others. They were outraged and more protests were sparked. Robert suggested they make a few protests directed towards discrimination in the workplace because of what happened to Rosa and because of what his pregnant wife was going through in her workplace. She was about 6 weeks pregnant. Roberts wife birthed twins June of the next year. The kids stopped him for a bit and exclaimed with laughter that their aunt and uncle were old. The beginning of July president Johnson passed a law (the civil rights act of 1964) that prevented workplace discrimination due to race, color, sex, national origin, and religion. Robert had met Malcolm X a few times but since being Dr. Kings best friend now he hadnt seen much of him. Malcolm reached out to Robert and asked if he could accompany him to a deliver a speech to the nation of Islam. He reiterated to the kids that every time something good happens something bad followed and thats what happened as on February 21 of 1965 as he was standing beside him he watched his old friend Malcolm X get assassinated as he was also hit by a bullet. This left him emotionally wounded for a few months as Dr. King visited him in the hospital a few times and his wife stood by his side until he recovered. This sparked the march known as Bloody Sunday(March 7, 1965) where 600 civil rights marchers walk to Selma, Alabama to Montgomerythe states capitalin protest of Black voter suppression where the police blocked and brutally attacked them. They finally reached Montgomery on March 25 as Dr. King had to fight the court for their right to march. After he recovered Robert focused on raising his family as he was giving up his time fighting in the movement as it was getting too unbearable. In the next couple of years Robert and Lynette had another child in 1968. Robert stopped the story and urged the kids that they needed to get to bed as their parents would be home soon and he didnt want them to get in trouble. He said they were at the end and that he would finish after they got ready for bed. They washed up, brushed their teeth, got in their pajamas and got in the bed. He said alright this is the where the story ends. Robert continued and said that even though Dr. King knew he was done with the movement he urged him to accompany him to Memphis, Tennessee as he didnt trust anyone else as much as he trusted Robert and that he would only be gone a couple days. Robert had just had another child but he decided to help his friend. In April while his daughter was 2 months old he left his wife to accompany his friend and promised he would only be gone a few days. On April 4 1968 during the morning his friend DR. Martin Luther King stepped onto the balcony to watch the sunrise. After a minute as Robert got dressed to join him all heard was a loud gunshot and as he ran to the balcony he saw his friend laying there dead. On April 11 President Johnson signed the civil rights act of 1968. He said the end and his kids asked how did he deal with losing two of his best friends like that and he said that he deals with it every day and that focusing on his family helps. The story was over and it was past the kids bedtime as he heard a car pull up and one of the kids said how do we know that your story was real and he pulled out his wallet and showed them a picture of him and Dr. King posing for a picture at the end of the I have a dream speech in Washington. Their parents came home and asked how things went and that they had just came back from watching the Malcolm X movie in theaters and thats when their kids jumped up and said Grandad told us the story about him meeting Malcolm X, Dr. King, and Rosa Parks."
Permanent things in the transient world,"Years rolled and time-lapsed. People say everything in this world is temporary and just a passing cloud, but in my life, there was one permanent, time-tested thing- our relationship and the footprints of the pain we survived to lead a peaceful life. I and my husband met when we were 14 years old and we were best friends for years but we both know very little that our relationship will turn from friendship to love, a true and deep one.This is our story. We realised our bond in the middle of an infamous riot-The Indias partition. Then we lived a poor life in a refuge camp, drowning ourself in the sorrow of the lives we lost. My parents went to Pakistan while my husbands parent came to the south of India. After a lot of struggles, we started a company and now we are one of the top 10 rich people in India.Even after archiving all this, there is still some pain and burden in our heart.Somedays I used to think about what could have happened if I had chosen Pakistan rather than India.Somedays I could think of an imaginary conversation between me and my parents or my younger brother who was everything to me.Even more than my parents.I miss the little chuckles of him and his glowing, smiling face and the unforgettable unconditional love he has for me. We used to play for hours in our backyard; the weather doesnt matter for us its always playtime.I still remember the aroma of Sheer khurma that my mom used to make for Ramadan.That doesnt mean I am not happy now.I chose this life with love and that took us here. Even though life became a peaceful and cheerful couple of years after partition the struggle we experienced to come stays in our heart.Its true that once we cause damage we cant completely cure the scare of the damage will always stay.Today is our 30th Wedding anniversary and we both are nearly 55 years old. Yes, time runs faster than we can ever think of. Even though we celebrated our anniversary with both our children, we have party tonight just for namesake calling all our business clients and office staffs.Is this the dress Arjun and brought you for your last birthday?Kushal asked.Yup u know I love silk sarees that too light blue, I wont say no at all Aisha replied.So all ready, He asked.Decorations-done, food- ordered and dancers are on the way she replied.Are dancers necessary for todays party?Kushal asked.Listen to me this party is not for us its an occasion where we can get a better bond with our clientsShe replied.Hmm, Kushal sighed.Now stop making all those sounds and get ready for the party Aisha ordered.I am ready He replied.Hmm suit looks good, but you didnt tie properly she unravelled his tie and tied it again.I did so you will tie it for meHe said. Aisha gave him a known glance.You will never change Aisha replied.Whats wrong with you you look a bit distracted,He asked.Nope, all good she replied.I know you better than you so stop lyinghe replied.Ok, dont get angry but I was thinking about my brother Aisha said.The family who left you he said.I left and not themvshe replied.Okay, you know anything about Pradeepshe asked.I am trying honey, but who thought he will leave the house just because I asked him to be responsibleMaybe you were a bit rudeshe replied.So in this house I cant even scold my own son, come on support me at least during our anniversaryKushal said.okok I will tryshe laughed.You know he should learn something from Arjun and Priya, Aryan is taking care our company while Priya is just going to complete her higher studies but she got a high position in ISROhe said.Priyas interest in physics is something rare and yeah I get it Arjun is talking care of the company really well giving us some time to breathe but Pradeep is special in his one way. Why are you not realising thatAisha asked.Ok lets not fight now everyone is waiting for us downstairshe said. They both went down together and Priya came running towards Kushal and gave him a big bear hug. Kushal and Aisha together gave a welcoming speech thanking everyone for coming and then a group of dancers performed an amazing dance and during dinner time,Hello Mr Kushal Prashant, I think you remember me Darsh Upptal said.Of course sir I am really honoured to have a person like you to my party. I am still waiting for your replyKushal replied.Yeah, before coming to that I want to give a speech,He replied.It could be our honour sirKushal replied.Hello, ladies and gentleman I could like to to use this opportunity to wish the couple happy anniversary and also break news to everyone present here.We all know that this couple is trying to have a partner with our company. The no. 1 company in India Upptal Multinational Company and in this beautiful occasion I would like to give my reply to this wonderful couple and the reply is yes.From tomorrow onwards both the companies is going to be in partnership with each otherDarsh said to everyone.Everyone gave a huge round of applause and wished the couple a further happy life.After the party, the family spent some quality time together celebrating the success of their company.Its going to a huge thing to have a partnership with a company like thatArjun said.It would have been even better if Pradeep was thereAisha said.Mom he left us without even informing usPriya yelled.Even I didAisha replied.Thats different you left home to begin a new lifeKushal said.Even he left for the same thingShe replied.But.. Before he could finish the sentence, someone interrupted him.Hi Amma, hi AppaPradeep said.Aisha ran to him and slapped him multiple times.How could you leave us like thatAisha yelled.Mom I am so sorry, I know travelling and writing books about it is not a very good job but I love it and I want to do what I like in lifePraddep said.No one is going to stop you from being happy but you could have informed us about this right, you just left us and went Kushal yelled at him.I know I know I made a mistake, and I did something to make up for thatPraddep replied.What did you didAisha asked.Uncle comehe said and there he was my brother, my protector, my best friend and the only person who can replace my parents, there he was smiling with his as always glowing face. He looked at me and it went straight to my soul-satisfying the thirst I had for all these years.I always wanted to meet my family and there he was. He came straight to me and gave me a hug.The love I had towards him poured out as cry and then I realized love is not only between lovers or couples but its between everyone its the prime source of humanity. If we really care for someone even after losing contact with them then its love which keeps us together. Love exists from the day one when our Mother held us to eternity. Even death cant erase it and the moment I saw him I realised love is suffice for the worlds existence and no boundaries can divide it."
Playing Hearts,"Playing Hearts It has been years, and I think about you all the time. My imagination runs wild about us being together. We have never had a date, nor you have barely spoken to me. We are in the same class and live in the same neighborhood. You must know who I am because everyone else does. It is a hot sunny day. I m driving in my red-hot convertible with white leather seat covers. The DJ on the radio said, If you really have someone you want to get next to, this is for you. I start singing I want to get next to you! Oohs wee that was one of my jams! The DJ play just my imagination next! Man, DJ must be feeling me today! I was thinking about Ken! Ken was someone who I have known since childhood. I used to sit on the bench and watch him play basketball. I became a cheerleader because I wanted to be close to him. I had the craziest crush ever! After every game, I would walk pass him and wink my eyes. Ken will smile and watch me walk away. That smile made my body shiver all over. A spirit will flow from the top of my head to the crown of my feet. Wetness came across my lips. I felt his gentle kiss press upon my lips. I felt his presence covering my body like an angel wing. Horns are blowing at me. I start to laugh at myself. It was time I came back to reality! My imagination was running wild! The next day I went to the school picnic, and Ken was there holding this girl hands. I was crushed! Carol ran up to me putting her arms around me saying, Girl hold your head up! You need to stop procrastinating and step up to the plate. I took a step back and look at Carol saying, You right! Either Im going to do something about it or leave it alone. I will come up with something! Carol said, Now lets go have some fun! We had a volleyball game, but we had to pick team captains. Of course, I was one, and the girl Ken was with was the other captain. Now how ironic was that! Thank you, God! I was first to pick a team member! Now you know I had to pick Ken! Oh! By the way Ken girl name is Morgan. Morgan stood there with her hands on her hips looking with daggers in her eyes. I did not connect eyes with her because I wanted to stay focus on the game. Let the game begin! Ken had first serve. He hit the ball near Morgan. Morgan ran and hit the ball near me, and I had to jump high to pitch it back over. It was almost there but it bounced back. Ken ran took a leap and pitch it over the net. I was breathing hard but at the same time I said, Good job baby! Ken smile at me and wink his eyes. I start to blush until all my dimples came out. Carol was laughing, and I look at her with rolling eyes. Carol said, Now the universe seen that! If Morgan did not know how you feel, she knows now! You should have seen the way she had looked at you! Later that night we sat around the campfire, I made sure I was sitting directly across Ken. We had to pass the wand and tell our most passion imagination. This was my moment for Ken to not only feel the deepest of my heart but to know the lovable part of me. I took a deep breath. I know a person whom I really like to know me and vice a versa. I am not a hard person to please. If you give me a candy bar with a love note attach, you will catch my heart. Always respect me, and I will make you feel like the King of an Island. I was breathing passionately. Before you have approach me than you will know I am yours. Your spirit will mingle with mind. We can walk everywhere, and people will know we are made as one. We can enjoy each other without always having other friends to be in our present.I slightly look at Ken wondering if he felt my heart. Did Ken know I was talking about him? This is the last straw! The only way to kick off this crush is to finally ask him out! Winter had kick in and I went on a skiing trip. Do not know how to ski but this was something I always wanted to do. Ken did not go on the trip but that is fine. It is not like we were dating. It whines up me having an accident while I was taking lessons. It was bad enough for me to lay up for six months. I had Carol to keep tab on Ken and Morgan. Finally, they broke up! Morgan was caught with a football player. I was so happy I kick my legs forgotten they were in a cast. The door was open for me! The big day has arrived! It is Carol birthday, and her parties always a celebrity jam! I knew tonight was the night I had to ask Ken out! I had to find out if we were meant to be together. I had this crush for five years, and it is time to proceed or let it go! Carol is trying to call me. I know what she wants. Rita, I know you are going to dress for perfection. So, are you going to make a move on him? Rita replies, Yes I am. I am going to finally ask him out for a date. The only problem is getting him alone. Carol said, Do not worry about that! I got you girl! All I could think of is Ken dancing with me holding me tight and glazing into my eyes. I need to look my best! Carol and I had a day of beauty. We had massage, facial, pedicure and manicure. We went to pick-up her dress, and I bought me some shoes.  I kept practicing what should I say to Ken. How was I going to ask him out on a date! Will he accept my invitation? Darn cannot mess this up!  Carol came to pick me up in her limo. We had a birthday toast and talk about how our night will be a success. We could hear the music before entering the hall. I let her enter first because it was her night to shine. My eyes wonder around the room and did not spot Ken. I mingle, had a few cocktails and dance. It was 11:00 and still no Ken! I ran to the ladies room to keep from crying. Carol follows me in the ladys room. Rita do not get upset said Carol. You look too pretty. Besides, you will turn ugly. We both start to laugh. This was to be my night, and it looks like Im not going to have it Carol! Let us go back to your party. I dont want to spoil your special day. We heard Reggae and ran to the dance floor. Reggae is a rhythm that makes you move sexy. As I was moving across the floor, Ken was standing in the middle of the crowd. My heart start to beat more than the rhythm. Carol dance towards me and whisper do not lose your cool. The DJ said grab a partner. So slowly I dance towards Ken and took his hands. I put on the sexiest moves on him ever and manage to stay a lady. I look over at Carol, and she was smiling giving me the thumbs up!  After the dance I ask Ken if I could by him a drink, and he said yes. During our conversation, I ask Ken if I can take him out on a date. Ken starts to laugh and said, You always ask men you dont know out on a date.No! I have always wanted to go out with you. I have been watching you for a long time, and always like what I seen. Silly to say you are my crush. Ken starts to blush Why I dont know you? Stop playing! I was a cheerleader for the basketball game. You were on my volleyball team. We had to give our most passionate moment at the campfire, and you caught my eyes. Sometimes I walk pass you on occasions and you have winked your eyes. Cannot believe you do not know me! Oh! forgot I had to disappear for six months because of a leg injury. Ken had this serious look on his face asking, Sorry I need to ask when we actually met? Rita replied, You mean after all these years you have never known my name! I was looking disappointed and feeling embarrassed. Guess we have not met. We knew the same people and always been in the same environment.  Ken said, After being my fan all these years, and you are a sexy dancer maybe we can be friends. Hi, my name is Ken. My name is Rita. Would you like to go on a date? Ken smile and said, I will like that very much. The doors open and I heard Angels singing. Finally, I will be going out with my crush. If things go as I have imagination, my crush will be bigger, better, and. I will leave you with an imagination. The End!"
In The Darkness,"We bantered and flirted, my eyes bouncing towards him and the timer making sure not to burn the cherry filled chocolate lava cake I've been perfecting for weeks.His words 'You're Gorgeous' warming my blood while he teases me about kissing my lips and then he waited until I called his bluff.Once he took two steps towards me the space between us felt heavy.He held my face so firmly in his gripThat when our lips met he became my anchorThe only thing keeping me from floating away.The world disappeared but I tasted the bliss of heaven.The hymn of his heartbeat , I felt each strum as they connectedpeace, sorrow, lust, desperateness but mostly vulnerability and need.His heart song is unforgettable with it's hauntingly beautiful sound.I dissolved into him, the only moment my universe felt right. He ate the lava cake with the slowest most seductive bites ive ever witnessed in a man but oh my they made me weak and my knees buckle. I'm not a chef and I usually burn grilled cheese but this dessert has been my art project since I found out it was his best friend, who unfortunately is now deceased, favorite. He teared up and tried to hide his surprise and appreciation and his face showed a different side of his vulnerability that made me want to hold and cuddle him until I loved all the pain away. He made us the most scrumptious chicago style pizza entirely from scratch. Flying pizza dough had never looked hotter and that includes its time in the fire stove. We ate and laughed and enjoyed the most delicate of moments and what felt like minutes turned into hours that melted into a night and left us both speechless in the morning. It didnt take us long to consider what we were going to do next. I could hear everything. Every chair as it whined under the guests, the birds in the trees singing their congratulations and the squirrels that ran amuck in the well tended grass taking advantage of the bountiful energy. The minister's voice was a cool monotone that only made his voice the perfect balance with the other white noise in the background. ""I knew from the moment"" He continues But I already know everything he's going to say because I also knew from that moment that there was no one else I'd rather spend my days and nights living for. I have a list of my top 10 kisses and that list changes frequently but number one stays the same because it was the first time our lips met and the first time I knew why I endured such an existence. I do I say with tears streaming down my face before I could stop them. His lips, his breath, his tongue softly reaching forward to graze mine locked me into him forever. Our first kiss will always be my number one. Our wedding night was celebrated heavily and I never knew the magic and passion a honeymoon held until I was laying there exhausted with all the sheets thrown off the bed. His body was warm and his face, oh that gorgeous manly beautiful face of his looked more at peace than a monk during Tai Chi. He knew that he was home as I laid on top of him and ran my fingers continuously through his hair and up and down his bare chest and shoulders. I travelled to three states and over twenty cities looking for anything to remotely feel like the place where my roots took hold. I searched for any type of clarity into the person I was and was becoming because growing and living is the hardest test this life keeps giving me. I struggled with not knowing how to love myself while trying to actively love myself and during this process I convinced myself that If I could move around, embrace different cultures and try new things then maybe I could find where I belong and who I was meant to be. Little did I know that I would find myself right before I found my person. I was home. He always looks peaceful when he sleeps. But to be fair to be fair, to be fair, so do most people. When he looks peaceful at night it's different because he's comfortable and he knows that he's safe. After years of waking up harshly in different environments, in war and being taught and told to always sleep with one eye open, he finally can rest easy knowing that the person next to him will not only die for him but live for him in every humanly way possible. He fears for me the most during the night because he refuses to allow me to think about the night terrors and flashbacks he goes through. He becomes embarrassed because he thinks hes a burden but everything he is and does only makes me love him more. Tonight is a good night and he looks calmer than the eye of a storm. Drool falls down the left side of his plump juicy red lips. He breathes heavily and snores so loudly he could scare an animal into its shell. The creases in his forehead and every muscle on his body is relaxed and soft. It's the cutest thing. Tonight was different. As I watched him fall asleep I was reminded of the time we have together and how precious and limited it was. My research lately has been about natural biological disasters and seeing the damage they can cause; the people who lose the ones that mean more to them than breathing, The futures people were preparing for gone forever and the hope and faith go out of people's eyes as light goes out of others. This reminded me of how the little things can mean the most and to never take them for granted. I watched his chest rise and fall and could only imagine what joy he was dreaming about with that peaceful smile on his face. I position my body on top of his to hear his heartbeat. Right before my eyes close I glance at the clock only to notice the picture right in front. Our wedding night, my dress was shiny but our smiles were even brighter, how lucky we are to have found each other. - Victoria"
The Color of Sound,"Though the caves in Batoidea Island regulate their own temperatures they still drop a few degrees at night. It is how Pierce is able to tell the difference between night and day down here. Gray. Thats how he remembers the rain. When it beats upon the earth it creates a kind of static in his ears that is an all-encompassing gray. Outside, even on a cloudy day, he is able to feel the warmth of the sun on his face or the soft glow of the moon. And then there is the barometric pressure. It changes, even in the caves, bringing an influx of moisture that he can smell from miles away when there is a storm. He can smell it, intermingled with the damp, moldy air of the system and hear it change how Karmen breathes poisonous flowers, exhaling a deep purple from where she sleeps on the bedroll near his.	He knows he isnt remembering this accurately, but after nearly nine months of blindness the colors all become pastel and begin to fade from memory, being shunted out by his brain as unneeded in the place of spatial recognition. Sometimes he plays games like this, associating color with sound so that they dont fade completely. He had forgotten the warmth of yellow, the glaring contrast of blood, but he remembered the hopeful olive tones of Karmens tired face. The deep woodsy brown of her nearly black hair and how the artificial light glinted off it. It seems strange to him that the first thing he wanted to remember about sight would be the color brown.	The rain had started about thirty minutes ago. He heard the first raindrops hit on the gardens two levels above them and trickle down the caves halls in tinkling white. Movement is always white. So when Karmen hyperventilates ragged purple into the air and rolls towards him, the white movement of her desperate hand stops inches above his chest. He can feel the warmth of it there, but it withdraws. Nails lightly scraping palm as her fingers curl inward and rest against her own chest.	Shed woken herself upright before she made contact, too afraid to agitate his wounds to allow herself to cling to him in fear. He hears the flutter of her eyelashes as she blinks, letting her eyes adjust to the darkness. The slight shift of her ears as she listens to the sound of his breathing. She settles for gently grasping a lock of his hair, just a slight connection to remind herself that hes still there in the darkness. She doesnt pull, but the slight movement tickles his scalp and sends a pleasant chill down his spine.	Bad dream? he asks. Its not what he wants to say. He wants to tell her that its ok to cling if shes scared, that she wont hurt him as much as shes afraid she will. But thats not Karmen. She hates feeling vulnerable and cant stand the thought of causing him any more discomfort. He meets her in the middle and reaches out a hand. She trades it for the hair readily.	Sometimes my unconscious mind makes me think that this past month never happened, she says softly. The places her hand touch his are a golden glow and full of life. He knows thats not the right visual, but its the image in his head. Why are you awake?	Its hard to keep track of time when youre blind, he says. He decides to be honest with her. Maybe if he shows vulnerability shell allow herself to open up as well. And when I close my eyes Im back in the basement. Sockets. Whatever. Its a figure of speech.	Sometimes he can hear air flowing around where his eyes should be. Its an annoying shade of orange. Sometimes he wonders what Ikaika did with them. Always after he tells himself that it doesnt matter. Theyd been thrown away, fed to something, or saved as some sort of trophy. It doesnt change the fact that hell never see again.	Sometimes he wonders if things would have come out different if he had broken. If he had wept and begged and whimpered like a child instead of defiantly meditating through the torture. But no. He knew Ikaika too well. He would have gone looking for more ways to hurt him without killing him to prolong his psychotic enjoyment. Or he would have found Pierce annoying and killed him.	Hed seen it all. Being Ikaikas adopted daughter, Karmen had seen more. She knew the hand that had done this to him, even if it was never turned on her. He bears her hidden pain in his skin, all the suffering she isnt able to put into words. Hed kept her from this harm as Bartholomew had asked. To do this he would endure much more. It isnt something he himself understands and he doesnt expect her to. Deep down he feels Bartholomew would be able to name the bond between them. He can feel it in the golden light linking their hands now.	Karmen takes a moment to adjust her hand in order to hold his more comfortably. He wonders if she can feel the gold. I guess the cave doesnt help. We can make other arrangements if you need it, she says.	I dont mind the cave. The air here is clean and I find the company more tolerable.	She chuckles, a lavender sound. If only Winston would stop making you try on three outfits a day you may just find us all rather pleasant.	Sometimes I think he has me there to keep me from straining my stitches. At least he only had to measure me once, he says in agreement, thinking of the old family tailor who had helped with their second escape plan. I dont think Id be allowed to leave his workroom otherwise. Youd have to come break me out again. He softly squeezes her hand and she returns the gesture. Thanks again for that. And for taking care of me while I recover. I know it hasnt been easy for you.	Im here because I want to be, same as you, she says. Ive known you my whole life. I plan to tear down my parents whole business empire to ensure you can live the lives you choose. This is the life Ive chosen.	Careful of his wounds, Pierce rolls towards her, wishing now more than ever that he could see her. He does his best to pull up the last happy image of her he can remember. Something other than that stormy night years ago when hed last seen her with his own two eyes. When hed been captured while helping her escape with Bartholomew. If you dont slow down you wont need me as a bodyguard anymore.	You really are an idiot, she says softly. Just because I can protect myself now doesnt mean I dont need you. Do you know how hard those two years were without you? I was scared all the time. I almost died on multiple occasions. And I had no one to talk about Bartholomew with. You didnt see him, Pierce. Im not sure he can even be classified as living anymore. I think were losing him. She curls into his hand, pressing her forehead against it. Gold. It breaks my heart.	Pierce takes a deep breath, feeling the fear pour out of her. Shed told him this before and neither of them had been able to figure out a way to help him, much less reverse what had already been done. There was more tubing and wires and machinery than a man when shed last seen him. He wonders what his old teacher would say back then if he knew that he would sacrifice himself so that the two of them could live.	Bartholomew would probably say it was up to him to protect those he cares about how he chooses. As the man who kept Karmen from growing up like her adoptive parents, he always made sure that they lived freer lives than he did. He gave up so much for them, and now it seems like there might not be any way to pay him back except to continue living, making the most of what they have left.	Do you remember me telling you about the years I spent with Bartholomew before he entrusted me as your bodyguard? He feels Karmen nod against his hand. My parents had been killed in a battle between revolutionaries and corrupt Navy officers working for one of the ruling powers in the North Sea. Remembering is ambered and fuzzy. He thinks he blocked out most of his life up to that point. He doesnt remember names or faces, the kingdoms or officers involved, not even those of his parents or his own surname. By the time he met Bartholomew, he was just Pierce.	My house had been destroyed in the battle and I had been living in the rubble for a week when Bartholomew found me. Hed come as soon as hed been given the report on the battle. It had been a total massacre with few survivors. He took me and three other people off the island. The others had somewhere to go, but I only had the army. Bartholomew personally trained me for two years straight. Hes a guarded man, but when he would leave to visit you he would tell me about it. I felt like your friend before we even met. Then when I was eight he set me as your bodyguard. One day I asked him why hed asked  to do it. It was obvious that he cared about you, but we were both kids. I was told that you needed a friend more than you needed a bodyguard. I just happened to fill both roles.	It seems kind of messed up when you think about it, Karmen says. Sending a child to guard a child from monsters like Ikaika. Its no wonder you got beat black and blue the first time someone tried to kidnap me. I mean, I guess he had Godwin there too, but he had to play by double standards to be an effective spy.	My point is, Pierce continues, is that Bartholomew understood that he couldnt take care of us all the time. He trained us and prepared us to take care of each other and ourselves. We lost Godwin, and we may be losing Bartholomew, but he wouldnt compromise himself if he didnt believe we could survive without him. In his own guarded way, I think hes telling us that were ready to handle things on our own. Losing people sucks, especially someone as important as them, but we have the resources to take care of ourselves if that should happen.	I suppose you could be right, she says, rolling over to look at the ceiling in a trailing white. But what if I dont want to?	Then youve got us, he says. Me, Winston, and Dr. Saaresto. And then theres the information web. Theyre always reliable. Then theres Winstons six brothers and-	Ok, ok, I get it, Karmen laughs. I couldnt ask for better support. Or better friends. Im really happy to have you back.	Im glad you came back. Ill take a cave any day.	Are you sure? she asks. Its not too clich or anything? We really can build you a house. Winston stole some jewels that he was polishing. Ive made a few black market contacts who are practically begging us for them.	I mean, seriously, you may have to be my bodyguard while I go train.	You are not allowed to train until youve healed.	Youve made that apparent. Dr. Saaresto made that apparent. You know, its not much different than being in chains sometimes. I cant go anywhere or do anything without someone making sure I havent reopened my wounds. He can hear the purple of his own words. He feels Karmen squeeze his hand. Im sorry, Mistress. I dont mean to complain. I know it is for my own good and I have to take care of myself before I protect others. He says this as if hes heard it a hundred times before. Twenty-five at least. He sighs, plum fading into peach. If it is your will, I will honor it. It is just that Ive been able to do nothing for two years straight. Im tired of doing nothing.	Ive given you something to do, Karmen says. How has your study of Braille been going?	You know how its going, he groans. So far Ive got dot dot dot,  dot dot. And did I mention dot dot dot? He sighs again, closing his sockets in exhaustion. Im sorry, Mistress. Its a wonderful resource and Ill get it eventually, but right now everything feels the same.	Braille dots are another shade of orange. Lighter than the air flowing through his sockets but more present, especially when a sheet of it is casually slid toward him every time he sits down. Sometimes hed like to just enjoy the act of sitting. Sitting is green, like a lawn stretching out with rolling hills and spring flowers. The points of contact of cloth to a surface creates a cushioning sound that is simply green. When youve spent two years chained to a wall, the simple act of sitting is heavenly. Maybe thats why he finds braille so annoying, even though the thought of being able to read again elates him to no end.	Having Karmen read poetry in the meantime isnt bad, though. Her voice is a velvety red, inviting and soft to the touch. When I do learn to read braille, will you still read to me from time to time?	Anything but poetry, she says with a slight groan. Maybe you can have one day a month where I read you poetry, but just one. I mean that.	Pierce chuckles. I can tell youve had your fill and accept your terms. He yawns. We should get some sleep. Winston will be back at it in a few hours.	Its his form of physical therapy. He must think youre doing better, considering that he only made you try on one outfit today. Or hes running out of fabric. Pierce grunts in response. She grows quiet and he expects her to release his hand and turn her back to him for the night. Do you mind if if I hold your hand until I fall asleep? she asks. I havent slept well during storms since that night. It would help.	Of course.	She closes her eyes in a flutter of white. Her exhalations of purple slow and her ivory heartbeat steadies.	The sound of sleep: pale blue, like rain should be."
the new phone,"""I walked on down the street and on either side there were phone shops entreating me to buy the latest cell phone with more minutes per month than I could possible use. Everywhere people were sitting in parks, cafes, walking down the street, all with phones pressed against their ears. Some of them had the invisible headsets that make it impossible to distinguish them from the insane who argued with themselves in public.I remember that in the old days a hippy walking down the street with his mobile was practically advertising that he was a drug dealer. At the time, people thought beepers were the cool thing, the communication buzzers that added bulge to your jeans pocket. However they soon switched from risking testicular cancer to the more fashionable perils of brain tumours and there was no looking back.In my book,Bozo and the Storyteller(free to read), I depicted phones as having tiny teeth that eat away at the moments of your life  the good conversations, the incredible sunset, the first kiss  and who hasnt had a movie or performance interrupted by someones ringing phone? But youll never beat this story: An Englishwoman told me that she had been in church at the funeral of her husbands aunt when she heard a phone ringing somewhere. Naturally, she assumed an indignant pout and started shooting silent glares around the pews. Who could be so gauche as not to turn off their phone before entering a funeral? The ringing stopped and then started again  clearly this was not a caller to be put off by an answering service.By now even the vicar had halted his speech and hushed whispers were growing in volume within the acoustics of the old stone church. Suddenly she was seized by a growing panic as she realized that her handbag was vibrating. She opened the flap and perceived in the same moment as the entire congregation that she was the culprit. She snatched the phone with shaking hands but as she had only bought it the week before she had no idea how to turn it off. With 500 pairs of eyes fixed menacingly upon her she fumbled with the buttons in vain. With each second her husband grew violently tense at her side.Finally he did the decent thing and grabbed the phone from her now paralyzed hands, dropped it on the floor and stamped on it. That didnt quite do the trick though and he was obliged to stand up and jump on the thing before silence was restored to the ceremony. Apparently no one saw the funny side and the vicar even rubbed it in with some stern words about propriety in the House of the Lord. Mobile phones are probably one of the best examples of how technology can change the nature of social interaction, even how we see the world. Try watching movies made before 1998 and youll see a hundred different plot twists that would never have arisen had one of the protagonists been carrying a phone. A killer white shark is stalking you on your broken down boat? Call the coast guard and hell have you air-lifted out of there in minutes.Another example: Call round to see a friend by chance and watch the expression of shock on their face as they open the door  but, but you didnt call first to check I was in! Was it really so hard to meet up with friends in the old days? What was so bad about arranging to be somewhere and then being there.Bill Watterson perhaps said it best in his Calvin and Hobbes strip where Calvin says something along the lines of Call this the 21st century? Where are the ray guns? The invisibility devices? Teleportation? I mean I still have to press the buttons on the remote control! Hobbes then observes that perhaps we could do with learning how to handle the technology that we already have. Perhaps the worst aspect of cell phones though is that they serve as amplifiers for all the mundane thoughts of strangers and uncomfortable insights into their lives. From the bored girl on the train who I recently heard explain in detail to her flatmate that while she lived the Heinz tangy flavour of beans, she wasnt sure if she could eat it all the time, you know? So perhaps best to stick with the good old traditional cheese flavourIt comes as no surprise then thatcell phone jammerssell like hot cakes to commuters who are driven insane by listing to this mindless drivel every day. While highly illegal (yes, the airwaves are all the private property of the carriers), theres a certain satisfaction in pressing a button and forcing someone to cut short their lovers spat by phone when theyre sitting just behind you. But its not all bad. I was sitting with a few friends the other day, talking about how to get phone numbers from girls and the whole drama of then callingThe advent of cell phones means you never have to speak to a girls parents ever again. You always get through directly to her.Then again with caller ID, getting her to answer the damn thing is another story. Once upon a time, there was a little gadget called a mobile phone. This phone thought it was great because it could let its owner talk to anyone, anywhere, without wires getting in the way. But what the gadget didn't know was that a new, younger model was approaching, and that this new model was only the beginning... When the first mobile phones appeared commercially available, they resembled something you'd build a house with rather than a tool for communication. Gradually, as the technology got more advanced, phones got smaller and the list of features got bigger"". all i wanted was help but no one was there to help me"
The Meeting,"This was it.Today was the day.Finally, she will be able to see her again.Its been five years. Five very long years. Her university days now feel like a lifetime ago. When she thought back to it, the girl who she was then it felt like a different person, a person she sometimes didnt recognize a person she was not sure she liked but when she thought about Yui Fay that discomfort disappeared and her whole life lit up. What would those years have been without her? Who would she be without her?And finally, she will be able to see her again. She couldnt be more excited.She was now standing next to the mirror trying on her fifth outfit while sipping her third large cup of coffee of the day. She could barely sleep because of the excitement. She kept imaging their meeting how they would run towards each other hug, talk of the old times. As she imagined happiness spread through her body, whenever she thought about it, she could not stop smiling but then she started to imagine their conversation and the warmth disappeared leaving her cold. She kept imaging Yui Fay as she was, but she knew that like her she must have changed. She wondered what she was like now.She took more care with her appearance than usual. She got used to dressing for work just a touch of makeup and then one of her power suits, black or white, the red one on special occasions or sometimes when she just wanted to well like a strong-independent-women. She has not noticed how much her wardrobe has shrunk in the past years.No wonder, all I ever go to is work and the gym. I could wear my red power suit, but ... Until this moment she had loved it, it was the source of her power, when she wore it, she felt like a superhero but now What would Yui Fay think?They used to make fun of business women and their power suits.After looking at herself in the mirror one more time in her red power suit, she gave up. She started to go through those old boxes at the back of the wardrobe that she has not touched since she moved. In one she found a red summer maxi dress, it used to be her date dress but then there was that night in Barcelona. After a particularly hard week at university, they spontaneously bought bus tickets to Barcelona. They slept on the bus and then spent the whole day exploring the city in the evening Yui Fay meet these sailors who took them out to sea. They spent the whole night drinking, singing, dancing. They were still up as the sun rose in the morning. To this day it the most beautiful thing she has ever seen.She has not worn the dress since. That memory was just too strong when she wore, she could not think of anything else. She really, really missed her. She was the wild one. Every night with her was an adventure. Its been such a long time since she has been to an adventure.What will she think of me now? Finally, the thought that she had been trying to push down for so long has materialized. So much has changed since her crazy university days. After university in Madrid, she went back home, she did her PhD, she got a great job at a great business. Her life was now boring. But she liked it, all of it even the power suits. Now when she thought back to that girl she was, it felt like a different person, a foreigner. What will Yui Fay think of the boring person her friend has become?After university Yui Fay went back to china where she took over her familys business. Maybe she has become boring just like her, with her own power-suits. After graduation they promised to keep in contact and to visit each other as soon as they could. But then life happened. She was busy with school her with work. They called a few times but then even those calls have faded with time and now they have not talked for over two years. Yet, from all her friends Yui Fay was still the one she felt the closest to. She knew all her fears, dreams, and her wildest stories. She knew that if something happened, Yui Fay would be there for her no matter what.Yet the idea of meeting her was terrifying what if? The idea was too hard to put into words. What if she changed? what if they both changed? What if the person she was so fond of was no longer? What if this dinner turns out to be nothing more than a meeting between two boring businesswomen?No! Thats not going to happen. She told herself.Yet the knot in her throat did not move.But this is what made her such a good businesswoman, no matter has afraid, how nervous she felt she just pushed it down. She put herself in automatic mode, dressed, put on her make up and got on the underground. All the while she went through her business plans her presentation for next week all the things on her to do list. She knew the knot was there, but she just ignored it, she need to.She got the restaurant early much too early. She thought about going in there sitting there waiting for her but that would be too much Instead she turned around and went for a walk in the neighbouring park.We really are soul sisters she heard from behind her. When she turned around, she saw Yui Fay in her black romper, the same one she wore that night in Madrid.And just like that the knot disappeared and she run towards her nearly taking her of her feet with her hug.And finally she knew everything was going to be okay."
Junior Taptap,"A patient in the paranoia ward reevaluated her entire situation. She concluded that her three sons, Randy, Marcus, and Errol, would come in, at any point shortly, and force her to swill liquid mercury out of a live frogs jaw. After being drugged, with her permission, by men with blue clothes and black socks, she spent the afternoon taking a quiet rest. Her words exactly before passing to her dream state: I dont wish to remember. I wish to sing alongside Pavarotti. The workers of the ward, mostly the unpaid interns and the low-paid interns, made a funny gameuncovering the catalyst of the ladys imagination as someone who wasnt barren. They went through the television feeds, and the back of the cereal boxes and the graffiti displayed outside her room. They uncovered paper notes that the woman wrote. They looked closely at the directions of her shampoo. Margaret noticed them searching under the cot of the dozing woman until Nurse Ob said to come along with the rest of the group.The long lemon hallway had natural light gushing in. A boy, no older than five, could be seen drawing his tilted thumb in the air over the edges of the ceilings quadrangular window tiles. Margaret could not make out his name tag. Everyone was given a name tag and a marker. They had to write their name, their favorite color, and the happiest moment of their life. Right now they were walking down at a bumbling pace, passing locked doors until it was time for entering. It was a pack of no more than twenty and no less than ten. They all signed up for the group check-ina much less costly option. The nurse thought to herself, They arent exceptionally ugly. Then she shouted, Miss Carson, your husband is in this room.A busty woman came to the front, furling her toes further inward. Nurse Ob pointed her pinkie towards the door which had opened only a moment before. Miss Carson traveled in. The rest followed with.The husbands shirt, pants, and scruffy beard were all in pure white cotton. He was sitting in the bed, looking at everybody. Margaret thought he had the faint glimpse of looking happy with his situation. Have we noticed any life forms on Pluto yet?No, Miss Carson answered. They havent.Have you called the relatives? I wished to do it myself, but the kind lady said that it wasnt allowed.Yes. She came closer, sitting down close to his tiny knees. I said that it was just a frenetic outburstonce in a lifetime.You should have said it was an accident, he said.Are they good to you here, honey?I like the food. And it could be worse.Nurse Ob coughed into the air. One minute. Please do not rush though. She coughed again.Miss Carson tried to see if he kept his chin clean. He did. Okay. Now give me a kiss. He gave her a peck on her bottom lip. Now give me a hug. They both embraced, then she hissed into his ear, Should I do something to enter in here?We wouldnt see each other anymore, he said. I rarely see anybody in the other rooms. It is usually only the counselors certified in making me feel well.Well still be in the same building. Ill imagine you in my arms. You can imagine me combing my hair. I was thinking about putting a knife up to one of my safari buddies.Very off, though.Of course I wouldnt do anything. No head would be cut off.What if you get a sudden urge to kill?I am not exceedingly insane like you, honey.The nameless boy hugged his aunt when it came to his turn. She was a little groggy after taking a beauty nap. While watching this, Margaret got a nudge on her shoulder blade. She turned around and saw a man clean-shaven and a few inches taller than her. He gave her a slip of paper. It read: HI! MY NAME IS WILSON. CALL ME AND I WILL PICK UP! It had his phone number neatly written at the bottom. Margaret put the paper in the pocket that wasnt full of other things.Entering into her grandfathers room, Margaret was immediately given a handmade paper duck with a bend in its bill. He asked if he could have it back only seconds later. His skin was button-mashed from taking an hour-long shower. He went on about tall skyscrapers being demolished and imploded in West Africa, many of them for safety and health concerns. Soon, however, he changed the subject to himself.I think if I play my cards right, I can stay in here for the rest of my life. No birthdays, no Christmases, no pond hockey. They dont suspect that Im not actually crazy. Are you hearing me, Margaret? He snapped his fingers once. They have these devices attached to their heads. They examine the neurons floating somewhere inside my head. What I do is, I think very hard about astrophysics or complicated math systems or being in public, so they believe the neurons in my brain during the test are sufficient in declaring me positively decrepit.You are insane.No no no, he said. Oh, by the way, my Lunchman broke. He pointed to the wired body with a pulse coming out of its neck. It stood upon a desk with a solid base made out of hard plastic. Colored wires came out every angle, sliding into the crevices and cracks of the made-up skeleton. When it traveled upwards the wires would slowly shorten and condense into a solid glob in the middle of the artificial skull. It was now making a small kischang noise that was amplified by an attached speaker where a mouth would be. Consistent mini sparks in the belly would shoot out, next to a dark red splotch. I tried to turn the volume up and got tomato soup on the inner cord.One minute. No rush.How is Mr. Taptap doing? he asked.It could be worse, Margaret said. He didnt take his pills this morning.I like him. I hope hell be alright. Do you remember when he. . . ?Margaret waited for him to stop rambling about his appreciation for Mr. Taptap. Then she said, I have to put him down later today.I remember now. Here. He vicariously pulled the plug off of the Lunchman and handed it to her. It was surprisingly light. Take it. They can give me a new one. It doesnt sound like you anymore anyway.I dont need one.But you need someone to eat with you. My doctor said so. Helps with mental health, with your emotional being. You cant just go along the course.I know.You cant just leave out these things, these materials, and act as if they arent there in front of you.I know.Im not trying to be a sap, no. Im trying to show you everyone needs it. Thats it, Margaret.I already have one.Waithold on. He took out a certain wire off from where the heart was and stuck it close to where his neck was. He hummed. Alright. It should be good. Ill try to mimic the way you make noises, so then we can eat together. Eat cake at nine tonight with me, alright? Promise?Margaret left the room of her grandfather that she would return to the next day. When she passed the lunchroom Miss Carson had a butter knife pointed straight at the kid. Nurse Ob said, Youll have to press it in a little further. There you go. I can get the paperwork. And Ill get you a bandage, sweetie. . . . Margaret stirred a peppermint candy in her coffee mug. She would leave her flat in less than ten minutes. Mr. Taptap was spinning out of control, somehow knowing that he was going somewhere. This was the only thing that made him overly excited. Even the green droplets that she would rub on his nose did not affect this jubilance. His whines went along with the scratching of his ears. He did this all next to the Lunchman.Margaret stared at this thing that was in her kitchen. She had one somewhere in the box under her mattress. This was a more modern versionthe fifth or sixth new issue. The speaker had a little pink in the center that made for inviting lips. Wires ran down like chimp arms.The veterinarian spoke with a mild lisp as he retold the same information in the paper packet. He asked if she was comfortable. He asked if Mr. Taptap was alright and said that she should bring his favorite blanket. Margaret said goodbye and that she would see him shortly.She grabbed the Lunchman recording wire from Taptaps slobbery mouth and began humming into it. The screen in the center turned on and listed saved numbers and letters for her sound. It listed fruits and starches and vegetables. The thing on the bottom said that it could guarantee 99.99% accuracy in mimicking the exact sounds. Margaret clicked on a bowl of Frosted Flakes. She turned it off after two seconds. The mixing sound of a human and dog was heard.. . . Truth.Are you smiling right now?Yes, Margaret said. Mr. Taptap just received a sedative and was steadily lumping into a phlegmatic mass of body. The room she was in had the atypical smell of cow shit. Truth or dare?Truth.Do you like to listen to music when you put away laundry?Yes, actually, I do. A small noise came from Wilsons side. Sorry I was just setting down my drink and it hit the table too hard. Margaret kept looking over to the vet to appear again. She didnt know where he went off to. Taptap was puffing his cheeks.Truth or dare?Truth.Where do you live? Maybe I can pick you up after my shift is over and we can go eat together, huh?Margaret told him her address as the vet came back in with a small vial of blue liquid. He set the instrument down next to the razor that was used on Taptaps arm. Here we go. Right, Taptap? Here we go? The vet gave two pats on his head.Truth or dare? said Margaret.Truth.Hold on, said Margaret. She watched the needle stick into the opening. The syringe collapsed down until it was back up againempty. Would you, if you had the choice, rather smell like gasoline or rain or old pictures? Or smell like nothing at all? She didnt hear his answer as Taptap began to lick the mat on the table. Then his tongue began to lose movement and rolled down weightless.Truth or dare?Truth.Are you ever lonely?He bent over and urinated on the spot. The vet turned him on his side. Hes gone now, I believe. He put a machine on top of his head. Straight lines popped up. Yep, there he goes. . . . I tried doing it but it didnt work at all. I only heard my own. It was loud and obnoxious. He slid a little over to the other side. I thought about it though. If its really this device playing tricks on me, or rather if it has some deep-seated power that I just noticed. . . It wasnt like this when Gail left. And if you told me I could hear her munching on a piece of bread or sipping a glass of raspberry wine, I dont know what Id do. But its not worse. Oh, God no. Do you think it is, Margaret? And why do you turn your head away? Do you listen to me when you are eating, Margaret? Maybe you will when I leave you. Huh? I dont know if they will let me out. Are you hearing, hey Margaret? They arent impressed with me, they say. They arent impressed. They want me out and I dont know what to do afterward. I dont know what to do. He grabbed the device and made her hum into it. There, he said, setting it down carefully.Margaret left after the nurse told her there was one minute left. She stepped down the tunnel dressed in holiday lights. Waiting for the train, an inflatable pink flamingo held up a 30% off sale sign. The owner of the shop, a man-crafted hobo, stated that it had attracted business for this salon the past month. This was the last day the flamingo would be there, so maybe she should come and buy something. Margaret felt this was obviously pointless and got on the train immediately taking a backseat where the caterpillar lights ended.Once off, she saw a woman getting her purse stolen. The man walked away casually, with no scream or insult coming his way from the woman. She stood there watching her purse floating in a mans physical strings. Margaret went over to her. The woman said, I had my cards and my contacts in my purse. I suppose I can get another one. It is easy now to find new cards and new contacts. It could be worse, I guess. This has never happened to me before.Margaret unlocked her door. The window coming from the bedroom made floating trapezoids over the blanketed rear of the sleeping man. His feet were dangling over the short bed. He had some of Margarets red lip gloss on his mouth. She went to the laundry room, then looked at the laundry detergent. She would need to get more as it was almost out. The electric cord was next to it but barely noticeable. It ran across to the kitchen. The kitchens carpet had a formidable outlook, and she was thinking of flipping it over to hide the sticky particles that were difficult to unloosen. On the carpet was the table with a small blue stain where the salt shaker was, and knife marks dotted the canvas. A bone laid right in the middle.Margaret opened the fridge and found a dry chicken leg sitting on a white plate. She fiddled with the Lunchman. The sound of cracking pebble food and of a familiar breath and smacking came and filled the room. She grabbed a mop head and began to squeeze the fibers, peeling the meat away from the bone."
A future of sweet dreams,"The letter came in the post on a Monday.It added to the somewhat weighty feeling the start of a week can bring, walking in to see the handwriting sitting on my doormat. It had been thirteen years since I'd heard from her.My initial thought was of how dramatic a letter was, so like her. She could easily have just sent me a DM or even emailed; my address was in my bio. But no, a letter, of course, even if the effort of finding my address took time out of her day, something she had never wanted to give before.I tore back the think yellowish envelope flap, the thin line of shiny glue making it tricky to prize open. It's not a massively thick envelope but it's thick enough for me to want to at least take a quick look before I throw it out.Joe walks through the door and drums his fingers on the table, an old habit, something I barely notice anymore. 'you alright babe?' I pull out the paper as I answer, 'yeah, you love? How was work?' he pulled out the peanut butter and a loaf of bread as he answered, telling me about a day that fell in deaf ears, my eyes focused on scanning the page in front of me. the familiar chunky handwriting brings back flash memories of apology notes, alarms, and social services workers. I shake off a light shiver and Joe walks over placing a hand on my shoulder. 'What you got there?'Looks like she finally bothered to write.'His brow furrows as he leans down to see the paper. Its not a long letter, half a side of paper. I'm divided, part of me doesnt even want to read it, the anger I harbored for years simmering just below the surface. But the other part, the child in me is begging to see what she's said, what little acknowledgement of my existence shes given this time.Its the child that wins, as I knew she would. My eyes scan the page as Joes do, taking in her words which play through my head in her voice, something I heard most through the answering machine. Cas,I know me leaving you has left you with a hatred for me that I cant help but understand. Iknow I broke your heart by doing what you begged me not to Cas and I need you to know, I am so deeply sorry. Nothing I can do anymore can give you back the childhood you deserve and I wish it could but If you will allow me, I still want to make amends. To try to, even just to talk. If you feel comfortable, please meet me Cas.Below was an address and shed signed it Mom Joe finishes reading at the same time as I did and let out a sigh. How do you feel?I shrug and place the paper down. I find it funny I reply her audacityHe nods picking up his freshly made toast. i get that babe, of course I do. But if you feel up to it, dont you feel it might help? To bring you some colure maybe, even stop the dreams?Hed been great with those. The dreams where I'd wake up in the middle of the night crying because six year old me was standing watching the car drive her mother away down the road again.I hadn't considered that. I'd let the repressed simmering anger boil over finally and as usual, hed brought me back to sense. Maybe I should?Do you think I should?He looks up and shoots me his familiar comforting smile.I think you should do whatever you feel you need to do Cas The nutty undertones of the coffee shop fill my nostrils as I push open the door, washing over me in a wave of warmth. I walk in, making my way to a two person table by the window, smiling at the waitress as I take a seat. The view is pretty, you can see the nearby river, quite picturesque in the soft autumn sunshine.The shop bell tinkles and to me time slows down. Way down. And then starts running backwards instead, like the rewinding of a tape, back into my childhood as I meet the eyes of my mother for the first time in thirteen years.Hey Cas,Mu- Jan. I stutterI get to my feet awkwardly, I dont know why, I dont quite feel like a hug but instead gesture to the seat opposite.Thank you for meeting me, I honestly didnt think you wouldNeither did I actuallyShe nods and tries to smileSo how have you been? We talk for hours. I hadnt thought I'd stay for long. But two oat milk lattes and multiple pastries later were still talking. She tells me about the life shed gone on to have, her path seeking help, her motivation to get better.It was you Cas. But I knew I couldnt come back into your life before I was one hundred percent sure I was well enough to be there for you if youd let me. To play some kind of a role in your life again, even if it was simply some woman you met for coffee. I had to try.By the time Joe rang it was getting dark outside, the last golden yellows just fading from the skyline. I hadn't noticed how long wed spoken but I did notice the weight that had lifted from my chest and the relief it brought me. I had felt for years as though she just didnt want me, that I hadnt been good enough for her. That shed left to get away, no idea that shed left so that in the long run she could actually remain part of my life. Or even life itself.We left together through the door, walking out into a cool breeze coming from the river. As we stood to part ways, she thanked me again, for the chance to explain and give me some comfort in knowing I was never the reason to her leaving. She reached out for a hug and this time I did, I was happy to. For so long I'd felt as though I was never quite good enough, like I must have done something wrong along the way and yet shed managed to take that away despite the years of it sitting comfortably at home within me.I went home more than happy. Joe saw it thesecond I walked in the door, the glow in my cheeks and as he said the, Joy in your eyes. As I lay down to sleep all I could think of was the future of sweet dreams awaiting me on my pillow."
Found in Paradise,"He couldnt believe it.His hand reached out  as if to touch, to feel, to confirm  but drew back at the last moment, afraid.What if it was all an illusion?A sick, twisted joke on his homesick mind.But for once, he dared himself to dream  to hope.So that's what the young boy did, inching closer, heart soaring with every step.The figure in front smiled endearingly at him, her blue eyes crinkling into crescents, and held out her arms. He fell into her warm embrace, hot tears prickling at his eyes, reminding him just how dearly he had missed her.His dearest friend.His closet confidant.His older sister.He sniffled and hugged her tighter, refusing to acknowledge the growing wet patch on her shoulder. She looked at his figure and laughed, a clear, lovely sound he hadn't heard in ages.He wanted her to keep laughing.""You've gotten so much bigger, Hush."" She mused, a nostalgic tone clouding her remark.The boy looked at her closer and discovered that, on the contrary, his older sister looked like she hadn't aged a day. Her pale face was still smooth and lean, her expressive blue eyes clear, golden locks healthy and glowing  in fact, she looked healthier than the last they met.The most striking detail, however, was that she used to be two heads taller than the boy, but now was only half a head taller.He hadnt noticed it before, but he reckoned he really had grown a lot.""I've missed you so much."" The little boy mumbled in response, throat sore and raw. ""So much.""There was so much  so much they needed to say, to ask, to tell, he had dreamt of this moment for years and was bursting with quips and questions and stories to tell her There was so much she had missed out on in his life, and so much he had missed in hers that the very thought of it was monumental and ""Hush,"" She called his name. ""How have you been today?""It was so random.But yet, so A very lighthearted question.Over a million responses overwhelmed his head.What was he to say?The universal ""fine""? But he wasn't fine.Was he to brush it off?Was he to tell her all the woes he had gone through, all that he had fought and lost and wept through the time they had been separated?In due time, he would. But, he decided  Not now.""Well... Better,"" He settled on. ""Much better.""She grinned, her iconic smile lighting up and eyes sparkling.""That's wonderful."" She gushed.And he had to agree. Today was surely wonderful.___""Lori.""Yes, Hush?""Lori, Lori, Lori."" He repeated, tasting the word on his tongue again.It felt right.He had forgotten how much hed missed that gentle voice calling his name.He seemed to have missed a lot of things.He missed the warmth of sunshine on his back, the earthy smell of his very own garden back home.He missed the sleepovers he had in the attic, ghost stories told under a messily sewn sheet, illuminated with a single flashlight.He missed going to class and joining in on the incessant chatter of his classmates.He missed playing with the rust-colored cat down the street as he walked home.He missed the Sundae Sunday discounts the ice cream man gave them in the ice cream shop.He missed bickering and fighting with his friends.But most of all, he missed his older sister.But now, here she was.Right in front of him, happy and healthy and whole.He decided, that if it was a dream, he didnt ever want to wake up.___He looked so much older.It was almost unnerving to see.Her little brother's face filled out, baby fat disappearing with age, looking more mature.He was skinnier than she would have liked, tall and lean.  But no matter how much he had grown on the outside, on the inside, he was still the same awkward youth she had practically raised, and just he was biting his tongue in his haste to begin talking.So was she.Yet, both siblings did not say a word, just examined each other, basking in the comfortable silence.It was hard to know where to start, she supposed.They hadn't talked, much less seen a glimpse of one another in years, so it was complicated to begin.They both had new lives, new beginnings, new ends.Both of them had gone through so much, gotten so little.Where to begin?She contemplated for a while.She wanted to know everything that happened, from the first moment they got separated all the way until now and was never one to wait.So she broke the calm first.""What did you do? When we got separated?""It was the question that had been plaguing her mind for the whole time, and now she would finally get an answer.Finally.___It trickled down to insignificant things.""What did you eat this morning?""""I haven't, yet.""""Unacceptable!""""Have you made friends?""""Of course, many more than you could,"" The sister answered, sticking her tongue out.""Nuh-uh. I bet... I bet I could make twice the friends you could!""""I'd like to see you try.""""Do you still like pancakes?""""Of course, who do you think I am?""""Well, there's this stunning pancake place that makes the most delicious chocolate chip pancakes, we'll have to go there sometimes.""Such trivial matters.They both knew that everything wasn't perfect, but it was okay.He was okay.She was okay.They would be okay.And everything was alright, again.___""Wait,"" The boy blurted, originally too high in his ecstasy to notice his surroundings, ""where is this place?""""I thought you'd never ask,"" She answered, eyes ablaze.She let go of his hand and stepped forward.There, stood a towering silver structure, high as a building and slightly intimidating.""I must've been blind as to not have noticed,"" the wonderstruck boy mumbled to himself.She lightly knocked twice on the bars, and to his astoundment, they creaked open, revealing a place he hadn't seen in so long.A place that looked like home. ""Welcome, to paradise.""_____Hi there, I'm A. Thanks for reading my story!This is my first Reedsy prompt, and all I can say is woo~I'm just so glad I got it out, no matter how cring or boring it may be. I have an issue with procrastination, and it's a miracle I even have 1k for this story.Disclaimer: I have no idea how to tag. I tried my best. :("
"Together, we can do anything","As I lie in bed, surrounded by darkness, I clamp his hand, I cant see him, but I can feel his padded hands, his soft silky fur, his hard button eyes. I never feel safe without Paddy, he is my dark defender.	Everynight, we lie together in my bed, with the duvet pulled up to our chins. Its completely dark, except for the crack from the door being pushed to instead of closed, and my array of stars on the ceiling. Theyve started to peel, but thats because Ive had them since I was two, and Im seven now.	I used to imagine that we were up there, in space, among the stars, me and Paddy, in our rocket, which was red, and stripey. We met aliens, and fought the bad ones. We always won because Paddy turned into a big bear, like the one from Were Going on a Bear Hunt. I had a sword, with jewels up one side. That was red as well; everything was red back then. Now I like blue and purple.	Now, I lie in bed, still with Paddy, because Ill never be able to sleep without him, even when Im all grown up. We still go on adventures, but now theyre even better and sometimes scary or dangerous.	I love to visit the BFG. I can see all his dreams, and choose the best ones for me and Paddy. My favourite ones are the ones where I have a mum, because mine died ages ago. I dont remember her, but Paddy does, because she gave me Paddy, and he whispers things about her to me. He says she was kind and pretty and funny. She had a lovely smile, and a laugh that was contagious. I must have loved her when I knew her, but I dont know her now. I dont even remember her now. And how can you miss someone you dont know?	I asked dad that, but he just smiled, sadly. He remembers her, and he tells me a lot of stories about her. Hes created a picture of her inside my head- him and Paddy both. They love her. I think I do too.	On different nights, sometimes Paddy and I go to the jungle and meet with Mowgli and Baloo. I love all the animals, except Sher Khan: he can be scary. Paddy enjoys going here, because he is really good friends with Baloo. They eat a lot of honey together!	On some nights, we dont go anywhere. We listen to the unseen terrors, right here in my dark, dark bedroom. They loom up against the wall, turning into monsters, whole hordes of them, creeping towards me, slowly, so slowly I almost dont see, but I know theyre coming.	Theyre always coming.	Paddy knows too.	Dad doesnt know. If he did, hed be here, with me, helping defend my bed. But hes not, he never is.	Hes always downstairs, arguing with .	Kyla.	Step-mother Kyla.	She wants me to call her mum, but I dont want to. Shes not my mum, never will be. If I dont, she shouts. Loudly. So I do. After all, its just a name. Right?	Every night Im not travelling, I hear them.	It varies how it starts. Kind of. Kyla will drink.	They think Im not old enough to understand, and theyre right I shouldnt. But, I do and I wish I didnt. I know drinkings bad. Im never going to drink, never.	Dad doesnt.	Mum didnt.	But Kyla does.	It always starts like that, but after that it varies. Sometimes, she will be happy and nice, giving me chocolate and letting me stay up. Her and dad will joke around and well all laugh and be happy. Its rare but it does happen.	Other nights, she leaves for hours and hours and hours. Its long past my bedtime and probably long past hers before she comes home. Drunk. Once so drunk, she tripped over and broke mums china vase. Dad shouted at her for that. Ive got a piece in my bedroom, under my pillow. Dad doesnt know otherwise he would take it off me, in case it hurts me.	The most frequent outcome is she shouts. At me. At dad. At herself. As long as she shouts, shes okay, but were not, me and Paddy and dad.	Thats whats happened tonight. Kylas shouting at dad. Shes not stopping. She wont stop. I hug Paddy to my chest and hope. I dont know what Im hoping for. Maybe for them to calm down, maybe for Kyla to leave.	Maybe for mum to come back, even though I know she never will.	Shes my mum, not Kyla.	Quietly, I get up. I need to close the door, need to block out their shouting. I know exactly which floorboards creak and groan, which ones are slippery, which ones have toys on, because Ive done this so many times. I dont know why I dont just close the door when I go to bed. It would be so much easier. I guess Im just hoping its going to stop.	But I know it wont.	When Im back in bed, with the cover once again up to my chin, I close my eyes. I close Paddys eyes, and pull him close. To my ear.	I need to hear his voice, which I know isnt real, real like the voices downstairs, but I love to hear it anyway. He whispers how we just have to wait, wait until Im older and Kyla cant tell me what to do, wait for her to leave. He tells me that we will be okay, just think of the future, think of dad, think of mum and her smile, the one which tells you that everything will be okay. Think, dont listen. Think, and imagine. Because he will always be there with me, through every night and every argument.	Together, Paddy, we can do anything.	And.	One day, Ill be bigger."
Books are Amazing!,"A young girl with oversized glasses said to her, Why dont you try picking up some books around her. She said as she pointed in the book covered room. You might find something you like. It has been twenty minutes since Rosemary and her parents arrived at their old house where her grandmother and the young girl she stayed with. Its a tradition for the family to go on vacations every summer. Last time they went to a cold fishing village where dads families are, but this time they were in the middle of a forest, in the middle of nowhere. Rosemary has been staring at her surroundings for a few minutes now, books in different sizes and colors painted the floor. Some are stuck together like legos, and some are in boxes; others are in bookshelves stored like canned tunas. What are you doing? Why is the room so messy? she directed her voice to the girl occupying the room. Cant you see Im reading and You should introduce yourself first before shouting at me, she said calmly as she fixed her glasses. My name is Maryrose, and my parents are here because they want to. Rosemary, I see my name is Lily. Maryrose wants to comment on her name being called wrong, but she was tired. She just got here. ..... ..... They both stared at each other for a moment, and then Lily buried her eyes in the book she was holding again. Wait, Lily. My mom told me to sleep here. Can you show me the bed? Im tired. If you want to take a rest, go ahead. The bed is there. Rosemary followed Lilys fingers, pointing at a spot where a lot of books were right at the top of each other. Thats nothing, but books right! she shouted at Lily, looking at her as if shes stupid or something. No, No, the bed is under the book, idiot! Just put the books in the box under the bed, she said calmly, flipping the pages. Rosemary, wanting to rest, did what she asked to. She put the books in the box, reading the titles as she slowly put them in one by one. She recognizes a few ones where her teacher mentioned it in English class, but most of the title sounds boring to her. Do you need some help, Rosemary? Its Maryrose, and Yes, its your mess in the first place. Lily closed her book, putting it gently in the chair where she sat. She placed herself next to Rosemary, who was clearing the bed. Lily quickly shoved the books in the box with one swipe. Half of the books were already in the box; some are on the floor. The rest of the books are being stacked on top of each other. There, thats done Rosemary, you can rest now. she patted the bed feeling proud of herself. She then returned to her chair, picking up her book, and laid down next to Maryrose, who was getting ready to sleep. What are you doing? she said, looking at her face. My back is getting tired, and I want to take a rest too after this. She said, slowly flipping the pages. What are you reading, by the way. Is it good? Rosemary, when people see other people read, they tend to get curious. She closes the book, now looking at each other. If you want to know if the book is good or not, why dont you read it with me. Rosemary. Im tired right now, so maybe tomorrow. Why dont you sleep with me, Lily? She said, Grabbing the blanket towards her chest. Yes, thats a good idea. Im tired anyway. Lily pulled the blanket towards her.  And they both drifted to sleep. It was the sound of Lily getting up that breaks Maryrose's sleep.  Good Morning, Rosemary. It was still around five in the morning, the house was quiet, and the room was cold. Maryrose wants to drink something warm, but since they slept early the other night, breakfast was not ready yet. Good Morning, Lily. They both greeted each other, still half asleep. So do you want to read with me? This is the book I was reading. She slapped the book on Rosemarys tummy. She made a strange noise, Lily let out a small giggle, she kicked her in response. was written on the front cover. Whats this about? Hide and seek. Maryrose asked. HAHAHAHA! she let out a rather annoying laugh. No, its actually about murders. Its good, trust me. She composed herself. Do you like playing detective? Rosemary. Well, not exactly, but I love to play hide and seek. Then youre going to love this Lily jumped next to her since it was a small book. She sticks next to Maryrose feeling the warmth in her arms. Lily opened the covers, and they both started reading silently, soundless whispers filled the room. Maryrose doesnt want to read books that much, but seeing Lily read silently beside her, she feels like reading as well. Time went slow, and artful words fill her head; one-second later, she was riding a train towards Soldier Island along with the few guests. It was her first time feeling like this, being sent to a new world just by reading a few words in a dusty, dirty room filled with books and tall bookshelves. She can feel her body moved in tension as the guest began to feel in danger. She can feel her brain reading faster, wanting to turn pages quicker. Last thing she knew, she was flipping the pages quicker, completely forgetting about Lily, who was reading beside her. Lily let out a small giggle, but Maryrose was glued to the pages. Next thing she knew, the sun already rise in through the curtains. Melting the cold air that covered the room. Rosemary, Its time for breakfast. Lily pats Maryroses head, disturbing her from reading. You see, books are amazing, right they take you to many places, help you feel emotions you dont usually feel. Its amazing how forming words to creative sentences can make you feel different emotions. Maryrose nodded in agreement, and they went to have a good breakfast together, bringing her favorite book with her and her newfound friend reading."
The man with no passion,"Once upon a time, on the planet UIO, in a beautiful Blue system lighted up the Blue Sun, far away from the planet Earth a man with no commitment was born. His name was Jussepppe. Since a very young age his parents have been trying to pick up a hobby and, to tell the truth, Jusseppe wasn't against it, but he had a problem he never could keep up with a hobby for more than 3 days. All his life he tried and tried to find that one special hobby for him, but no hobby was enough for him. Once while reading a Galactical Newspaper Jusseppe found an article that was called 'Top most fascinating hobbies for you'.""That is just perfect for me"", Jusseppe thought.Next morning Jusseppe woke up early, put his favourite yellow overalls on and decided to start his journey to the perfect hobby. Poor man was always so jealous of all those men being passionate about something and he wanted that...First on the list was painting the walls. The advertising said: ""Bored of ordinary painting? Come to us and we turn your view on painting from upside down"". Jusseppe came into the studio with a newly bought yellow paint, not to bedraggle his overalls. He drew and drew and it seemed interesting, but then, after he finished and looked at his project he felt defeated. ""It isn't pretty at all,"" he thought.There were many hobbies that Jusseppe had tried before and didn't succeed. There was horse riding, ice skating and other things on that list. Once he thought of retrying those hobbies again horrible memories from the central ice rink appeared in his mind, like it all happened yesterday, but Jusseppe never stopped trying, no matter how sad he was. There was rarely someone in his life to tell him that he is doing a great job, but his parents taught Jusseppe well, he always was a ray of sunshine, even in the strongest rain.""How about this one?"" Jusseppe would ask himself silently. After all those disappointing trials he never stopped going, but now it seemed it was the end. His precious smile began to fade, he couldn't hold it anymore. ""Dear universe, why are you doing this to me?"" a man with no passion asked. He never knew what he did wrong, but it didn't even seem that something bad could have possibly been done by him.Everytime after finding a new possible hobby Jusseppe filled with excitement, but lost all of it after not succeeding in his personal mission.Ho ya, who came to my place? Hello and welcome, my friend, said someone as soon as Jusseppe walked in the architecture club. It was a very low womans voice.Hello nervously said Jusseppe, Can you help me? Im looking for a hobby.Of course, and by the way architecture is a great hobby for artistic people like you and me, said a woman looking at Jusseppes yellow overalls. My name is Miranda. When do you want to start?And when is it possible to start? Jusseppe askedOh what a gentleman, you can start even now Miranda didnt finish.Ill do it, works for me interrupted Jusseppe.Very well then, lets go, honey said Miranda sweetly.From the main area and entrance Jusseppe and Miranda walked into a room, filled with color. Miranda explained that sometimes people like to draw on the walls, and, well, she lets them.Its art, you see, she told Jusseppe when he asked.Besides the bright colors the room was filled with different architecture models or small buildings as Jusseppe called them. Small building were everywhere and he was eager to start creating projects and models as well as all other people there.Being influenced by knights and complete fuss Jusseppe decided to create a castle based off his sketch. His process began. He spent lots of time carefully drawing every little element of his castle. The night came to town and the Blue Sun began playing its games, oh how it loved it. Finally, Jusseppe felt that his sketch was ready. He proudly raised up to look from distance and was disappointed. It was nothing that he imagined, that grand castle faded from his memory. Then he thought Why dont I create a small house, my own model? Everyone is having so much fun with them. He took all the tools and elements required for the model. He started moving his blue humanly fingers trying to create what he wanted, but this didnt go as planned either.Just like in all other times he decided to leave, there was nothing for him to do there. Another hobby downHey, whats wrong? asked Miranda on his way out.Everything, but nothing new, I got to go, said Jusseppe and rushed out.He rode his newly bought bike, his other chance for a hobby. Under the dull lights of the streets he was trying to hide his pain. Suddenly his bike stopped and he began to walk. Another hobby didnt attract him, nor did running, the hobby he has tried before.When he got home, the whole ball of emotions came out of him. The tears coming from Jusseppes eyes couldnt stop, they needed to get out, finally. Little blue gentleman hadnt cried in a long time, he was taught not to.When Jusseppe finally got home, he didnt know what to do, his life was as plain as nothing else in that world. He took a shower.Should I take up soap making again? he thought, Sure, why not?After he had taken a shower, Jusseppe felt clean and renewed. He felt like he could do anything, so he took the ingredients needed for making soap.Lets start, he said out loud.For a couple of minutes everything went smoothly, but as soon as Jusseppe got distracted, the mixture went bad.Oh, no, again, repeated for a thousandth time Jusseppe.That was it, Jusseppe needed help, but he was scared to ask for it, because his father always told him not to, to be strong on his own.The following morning right after the blue man got off the bed and ate his cereal, he went to a psychologist, he needed help and his lost confidence.The only psychologist in town he knew was Fraida, a woman he met when he tried rock climbing. She was nice, even helped him to put on his equipment. Good morning, can I please see Miss Fraida? Jusseppe asked when he reached the psychologist's office.Jusseppe is that you? Miss Fraida asked from her office, ome in, darling.Hello, Fraida, said Jusseppe when he walked in.Hello, what is wrong? responded Fraida.Well, remember how I was trying out different hobbies, the blue man started. Fraida nodded.I tried everything there was and not even once, but I dont know what to do, I dont feel any emotion towards everything, all my beginner's excitement disappears as soon as I finish. Nothing keeps me entertained for too long. Can please help me? I dont know where to go and whom to ask, Jusseppe finished.How sad and I know how long you have been like this. I feel so sorry for you. But what did you say you feel every time you start? Fraida replied.Oh I love that, it is so exciting always to try something new, Jusseppe replied.I dont know what you think, but I notice that the only fun part for you, blue man, is actually trying new things. Im no expert, but trying new activities can be a hobby too, and you seem interested, the psychologist said nervously.Yes, I suppose you are right, Jusseppe said. No, you are actually absolutely right, how come Ive never thought of it?Why didnt ask anyone else? Maybe someone would have helped, Fraida told Jusseppe.Asking people for help? That doesnt make me strong, my dad taught me well, the blue man answered and looked at Fraida surprisingly.No, that attitude will not lead to anything good. No person can make it on their own. Life is hard enough to be alone on the way, Fraida said. Jusseppe looked puzzled, but knew that she was right and he proved that on his own. Do you understand? Dont be afraid to ask for help, that is why there are so many creatures on this planet. Each one is different and has different perspectives, but that is not bad, finished Fraida.Yes, I understand, thank you Fraida, for everything, seriously, the blue man said and Fraida nodded.After this meeting Jusseppe never was the same, but that wasnt bad - he needed changes. He began to live his life in a new way, with his newly found hobby - trying out different activities.Legends say that he gave up his job to become a criti, the happiest critic ever. He was passionate about his job and, well, his yellow overalls, which he wore even more often since then.                                                                                                       The end."
The versatility of the rushed,"Sitting in the cafe every Tuesday, I order Fennel tea, open the book that I always carry in my handbag, and start reading my favorite short story. Everything in that period of time is a mere distraction, that serves to ease my thoughts tension. It is always very pleasant to sit in a quiet place, enjoy a loving atmosphere and appreciate a book you love. I stay like that in the cafe from seven in the morning until seven and a half hours.	That cafe is one of the most peaceful and serene places I know, where it can be found, in addition to good tea or coffee, great company. It is a nice place and very well lit, as it is extremely anointed with the Sun's golden sunlight. That day when I repeated the same routine that I had kept for years, I sat on the usual chair and table.	A tall, sturdy boy passed in front of the establishment. He was a young boy who seemed to be around 16 years old. He was thin, with tanned skin and straight honey-colored hair, which contrasted with his ruby green eyes. Even with a so radiant beauty, what caught most of my attention was what he was bringing with him: a cart full of books being pulled by his left hand, and another book being carried by his right hand, which the teenager was reading very diligently. The plot of that book should be very good, seeing that the boy couldn't take his eyes off it while walking.	The following Tuesday, I heard the sound of wheels on the cobblestone of the sidewalk in front of the cafe again, and I turned to look at the book boy. Well, the books were gone! The young man was balancing himself with great effort on top of a pair of green skates with orange neon stripes, staggering from side to side in search of balance. He was not very talented... But with practice you get perfection. After a few seconds, the boy left my sight.	A week later, I was very curious to see if the skater boy had improved his balance! When I saw a youthful shadow in the corner of my eyes, I turned to look at the skater, but there was not a pair of skates on his feet, he was only wearing a pair of old sneakers. The young man was wearing headphones in his ears, with so stupidly loud music that even I, who wear hearing aids, could hear it. Now the boy was dancing! He jolted himself on the sidewalk until I lost sight of him again. He was not a good dancer neither... There was a possibility of the boy improving his dance steps until the following week.	After seven days, I was waiting for the dancing boy, but I was wrong again about his hobby: he was trying to walk with his hands this time! If I'm not mistaken the name of this acrobatics is handstand... The young man was trying to walk while doing handstands. He fell just over three times and I stopped counting his falls after that. Now my enthusiasm was to see if the boy's hobby on the following Tuesday would be the same as the week before.	The following Tuesday, I was already sipping my calming tea when the boy appeared again, but this time he was walking with his feet and not with his hands. While he was moving along the sidewalk with narrow, calm steps, I confirmed my hypotheses about his ""constant hobbie change syndrome"": now he was carrying a notebook and a pencil! I put on my glasses to spy on what he was doing in the notebook and found out that he was now drawing... Maybe his drawing was a superhero. It was difficult to know, he was also not one of the best designers.	After another week, I decided to try a different type of tea that day, as a tribute to the versatile boy I had been observing for the past few weeks. The clerk thought he had misunderstood my request since I have been drinking the same type of tea for ten years... My retired life may seem boring, but it is happy. As I sat down with my Chamomile tea, I saw the boy with a ruled notebook and a pen in his left hand... He seemed to be writing a poem. I suppose he was looking for a rhyme, as he thoughtfully raised the pen to his lips. As usual, the boy went out of my sight in a matter of seconds.	A week after seeing the boy try to be a poet, I saw him walking down the street with a soccer ball at his feet! Now he was a footballer... He was very good indeed: he had great skill with feet. The boy played with the ball for about half an hour: ran down the sidewalk, and kicked the ball all over the street. After that, he decided to sit on the sidewalk to catch his breath.	I had already had enough time to drink my tea, so I got up calmly, took the tea-cup I used, and left it in the hands of the kind attendant who served me. I left the cafe, stood at the edge of the establishment door, and kept watching the boy. He got up, went to his car, took out a guitar, sat down on the sidewalk again, and started testing some melodies and lyrics... It was nice to hear him. I joined him at the edge of the asphalt and said:	- You are very skilled with your feet, boy! And you have the musical ability too... Maybe you should dedicate yourself to one hobby at a time.	- Pardon?  he asked.	I gave a hoarse laugh and added:	- In the last few weeks, I saw you being a book lover, skater, dancer, gymnast, designer, poet, football player, and just now a musician. One step at a time, boy... One step at a time."
Another Lockdown Stash,"Sarah was engrossed in her latest detective novel when the doorbell rang. Startled, she dropped the book and hurried across the hallway to the front door. She opened it in time to see a figure retreating briskly down her driveway but she could not tell if it was a man or a woman. Looking down at her feet she noticed a large grey plastic bag, no doubt containing her most recent online purchase.Thank you, she yelled to the figure, who acknowledged her by waving an arm. Lockdown restrictions, Sarah thought. They arent even allowed to wait until someone answers the door. I wonder how many parcels are stolen each day?She took a tissue out of her pocket and laid it over the parcel before picking it up. Once inside, she sprayed the package with an anti-virus solution and then left it on the hall floor. It would remain there, unloved and unwanted for the next three days, just to be on the safe side. Who knows what it might have picked up on the way to her house?However, Sarah knew exactly what it contained: a calligraphy set and a selection of different types of papers and inks. She sighed. Would this be yet another fad that led nowhere? Her spare bedroom had already been converted into a studio of sorts, with shelving along one side, a worktable by the window, with a comfortable chair and an angle-poise lamp to help on dull days.The floor was littered with boxes containing half-finished projects and stashes of raw materials. She kept telling herself she would finish every one of them one day, but somehow that particular day never dawned.This recent burst of activity or inactivity depending on which way you looked at it, had begun with the first corona virus lockdown in April 2020. The initial attraction of being outside doing the gardening had palled and Sarah had sought something creative to try as a hobby. She had trawled through the internet looking for free courses and initially had fancied the idea of crochet. Her grandmother had tried to teach her the basics when she was a child, but as a six-year-old she had been cack-handed and could never manage to find the right tension for the thread. Things that were meant to be flat came out crinkly and vice versa. Well, Ive got plenty of time on my hands at the moment, so I may as well have another go, she thought to herself, as she added crochet hooks and wool to her online shopping basket and then placed the order. Almost as an afterthought, Sarah realised she needed a pattern, so she spent another hour searching for one. Eventually she discovered a summer top, with no shaping that used an easy stitch and it was free. She downloaded it and waited for her purchases to arrive. A few days later, she started work. For the first hour or so, she had to keep referring to the glossary at the end of the pattern to understand what she was meant to be doing. The constant abbreviations simply bamboozled her. Gradually the crochet work began to emerge from the end of the hook, the ball of wool became smaller and Sarah began to feel a sense of achievement. She was so encouraged that she photographed the inch or so of the garment that she had finished and posted it on social media with the message Look! My first attempt and Ive got this far already! Ill keep you posted.Sarah was feeling stressed the following morning and decided her crochet work would calm her down. It didnt. In fact, it had the opposite effect. The tension of her stiches was completely different and the width of the garment shrank. She threw it on the floor in disgust.The next day she unpicked the offending rows and tried again. It was better this time and she felt she was making progress again. By the end of the week, she had almost finished the front.Then she spotted an advert for a felting kit online and decided to try her hand at that. The crocheted top was forgotten, as she struggled with trying to make felt out of a bundle of wool using only a long needle. Instead of the fluffy little bird she had hoped to produce, she had a ball of tangled threads covered in spots of blood where she had pricked her finger. It was placed in the cardboard box it had arrived in and put on one of her shelves. Maybe she would finish it for Christmas: robins are always associated with winter, so it would be appropriate. Next, she tried pyrography, but found that the smell of the burning wood turned her stomach. Perhaps one of her friends might like to take that particular project over: after all, she knew plenty of people who were creative.When the lockdown restrictions were eased to allow people to meet one other person outside for socially distanced exercise, Sarah arranged to meet her friend Cathy. A socially distanced walk along the beach would burn away some of those extra calories they had both consumed over the preceding month and talking on the phone did not feel the same as a face-to-face conversation. So, what are you making now? Cathy asked, after they had finished discussing the Governments response to the pandemic and how bored they were being at home for so long.Im in between things at the moment. Ive just bought some calligraphy things, but I havent started using them yet. What about you?Ive nearly finished that skirt. Hopefully once its finished, well be able to get out more and I can wear it. Didnt you start crocheting a top a while back?I did, but I couldnt get on with it. Ill probably just undo it and use the yarn for knitting, Sarah admitted.Do you ever actually complete anything? Cathy asked, with a laugh. Not very often. I just get distracted too easily. I find something else I fancy having a go at, I buy everything I need and then lose interest.Maybe theres self-help group for people like you. Crafters Anonymous, for addicts who keep purchasing wool, needles, cloth, clay, paints and whatever and then stash them round the house when they are half-used. If it doesnt exist, you could create it: a self-help group on the internet, where people can encourage each other to get on with things.It was an intriguing thought and it bounced round inside Sarahs head for a few days. Then she finally searched the internet but could not find any groups that seemed to fit the bill. OK, she thought. Ill create one myself.That evening she sat at her craft table in front of her laptop, a glass of wine by her side and launched her own self-help group called Another Lockdown Stash.There cant be much work involved in being the administrator, she thought as she tapped on the key that unleashed the group onto the web. Feeling pleased with herself, she shut her computer down, poured herself another glass of wine and began reading a book.The following morning when she logged on, she was amazed to find that fifty or so people already wanted to join her little gang. By that afternoon there were over seventy, all eager to explain what they were working on and asking for help to finish. Some just needed a bit of encouragement but others were asking for technical help on a myriad of different crafts. Just what had Sarah created? Over the following week she noticed that people had begun contacting each other to offer advice and information. They all seemed an incredibly happy bunch, glad to contact other crafters with the same predicament. It did not matter that they came from all round the world. Somehow they managed to communicate with each other.Then something dawned on Sarah. If she simply posted pictures of her unfinished attempts, it would act as a talking point for all the other members of the group. For once in her life, she would be creating something that she did not actually ever need to complete. In a strange and convoluted way, she had solved her problem!"
Growing Pains,"Just promise you wont tell mum. Evie had me by the wrist now and was pulling me out of the back door. You know I cant promise that sweetie, I replied, trying to stay light-hearted in the face of my daughters obvious anxiety. She was taking me toward the garden, with a real sense of urgency in her tone, through the glass doors away from where I had been working at the dining table. I had terminated the call early when, no matter what I did or faces I pulled, she continued to tug at my sleeve. Daddy! You have to promise! Im not supposed to be telling you either.I was starting to get concerned now. Evie, just tell me what Im looking at. She said nothing and continued to tow me, like a reluctant ship out of harbour, toward the back of the garden and the shed. It was her little den, a secret space just for her where her little three-year-old mind could explore and seek stimulation. The grass was spring green, and by the time we reached the shed my navy slippers were soaked through with dew. She took me round the back of the shed and pointed at some stones on the ground.Look! She said tearfully but firmly, Look! Shes hurt! Feeling, I must confess, relieved not to find anything more sinister, I knelt down to examine what she was trying to show me. In the small gap between the shed and the fence at the bottom of our garden, was a wild garden and what she called Jungle. The grass grew tall and moss was thick on the ground, with insects burrowing in and out of the moist soil. She was pointing to a ring of stones that she made made, a very neat ring for a three-year-old. It was a perfect circle and in the middle was an empty green space, clear of mud, dead insects, twigs, and anything else.Can you see Daddy?Yes, I can darling. Its very pretty, how did you get the stones so neat?It wasnt me it was Fairy. I nodded my head with a half-smile.Ah, I see. There was a pregnant pause and I noticed that she still seemed upset.So? Can you see? She was almost pleading with me now, pointing at the ring with more and more ferocity. Yes Evie, I can see your ring. I just said its very nice.No not the ring! She shouted. In the ring! Can you see Fairy!? I looked back at the ring, wondering if there was a toy within it, I was supposed to be looking at but I still couldnt see anything apart from perfectly flat green grass. Theres nothing in there sweetheart. Is this a game?No Daddy, She begged, bouncing her knees in anguished frustration. Fairys in there! She is hurt, or poorly, I dont know. But she needs help. She said not to get you, because youre a grownup, but I didnt know what else to do. Please Daddy, you have to see her. The scales were falling from my eyes. Is she pretend?NO! Id seen tantrums before, and Id heard Evie shout when she was cross or particularly upset about something, but this was on a whole other level. I tried to soothe her with gestures and a cuddle, but she pushed me off and knelt by the ring. Come here Fairy, let me show him you. She gathered up the air in her tiny palms as if it was a timid forest animal, then held it out to me. Please Daddy look. Dont just look with you eyes, look with your mind. I started at that. She was behaving with such gentility that I began to believe in the creature she held in her tiny hands. You have a grownup mind Daddy! And that doesnt let you see Fairy! You have to use your child mind. You have to imagine!Imagine. She said the word, not like it was a childs game, but a facet of myself that I was missing, and I felt a pang in my chest. But I did as I was asked. I let go of my preconceptions of childhood games and fantasy. I let go of my zoom call, and my water bill, and the pandemic. I let go of myself and looked down with naked eyes and beheld my daughters new pet.It had purple-pink wings, shaped like a butterfly but puffed up, iridescent and clear as if they were shaped from bubbles. There were two tails that hung limply over the sides of my daughters palms that reminded me of a manta ray and both stemmed from a body of a deep, deep ruddy violet. The body was insectoid as opposed to humanoid, with layers of coloured carapace that refracted light softly like silk. Its round head and face had recognisable features, a mouth and eyes but no nose. The eyes gazed upon me fearfully, like a puppy caught in a trap and what could have been my fear was melted by pity.I looked the strange creature up and down with my open mind. It had no visible wounds, but I could tell somehow that it was ill. Shes been getting worse Daddy. Evie said softly and sadly, The bigger I get, the sicker she gets. She held the strange creature out to me. Fix her Daddy. My throat tightened at the look on her face, and I reached out to touch the creature, but instead held her hand. I dont think I can fix her darling. I began gently. I think the only one, who can fix Fairy is you.But how Daddy? I cant do it! I smiled gently to try and reassure her as she fought back her tears.Fairy isnt real, but that doesnt mean you cant believe in her. She shook her head.But I dont know if I do anymore. The bigger I get, the farther away she seems. She doesnt make sense like she used to. There are questions in my head and the more they ask, the more she seems to disappear! As she said this, I watched as the strange fairy writhed and winced as if in pain and I squeezed her hand.Youre getting older sweetheart and youre learning the rules of the world. As you get older, youll realise that things like fairy dont belong in it. They arent, in so many words, real. For a moment she seemed to despair, and her pet coiled up in her palms like a sick dog, but I squeezed her hand. But that doesnt mean they cant be real to you. I tapped the side of my head with my finger. While you believe in her, she can always be real. She will never get ill.Forever? She asked and I nodded.AbsolutelyEvie looked down at Fairy, and Fairy looked back at my daughter and it seemed like they were smiling at each other. The mysterious creature faded away out of her hand, becoming more and more translucent until there was nothing left. Evie closed her fists and looked up at my face. Ive got her safe now Daddy. And she tapped her head back at me. I held her hand as we walked back to the house.Thank you for helping me Daddy!No sweetie, I said watching a translucent dragon circling out the corner of my eye and I watched it loop away through the sky. Thank you."
The Hobby- a serpent entangled  neck by Yakshaya K,"Daniel Brian born under which evil stars began eating cockroaches, ants and even lizards and by the age of twelve heHad established a big Hobby Hall wherein he kept a vast collection of many lizards, scorpions, pigs and pigeons as well.This collection of different earthly, air and ocean deep waterAnimals too were very meticulously collected. At the age of seventeen he made it open to the public at five dollars a ticket.Money began to rush in his coffers and gradually it led to theExpansion of his hobby. He was so madly obsessed With this hobby and so busy into it that he would forget to gothe bedroom. He would not keep his several animals starvedEven at the cost of making his lady starved in the bedroom. AnyOne got his angry look in case any objection was raised. He Growled like a ranting pig if his father objected:How dare you Pa! Raise any objection. Have I ever asked you any money for my pets? You are my father and I am your son.But I am not your slave. His mum intervened to pacify the looming storm. Hes your father and wishes you well. So. By the time he attained the age of thirty-five he lost his parents. He had only one sister but she became partly lunaticBecause of her totally lonely existence. None of the boys could imagine marrying her as they feared that they as well will be dragged into his hobby.He got married to four girls but all of them divorced him as the cries and shouts of pigs, dogs and monkeys spoiled the peace of his vast palatial castle. Four wives all left him to desert him forever. He needed woman to take care of his hobbies but not a wife to sleep in the bed. He had all his time for his hobby but it was a one-sided situation. You have also to give if you want to take. Eccentrically involved in this hobby made him almost a half monkey. He had a very large bank balance but he had noSuccessor to carry on with his hobby from any of his four wives. His hobby of keeping animals had become a hurdle into other important aspects of Human life. In many ways he had becomeQuite eccentric, obstinate and a quizzical character He felt all the time that woman was the most deceitful and fickle-mindThat ever could be. He felt morose and depressed to reflectUpon his bad luck of being thrown out like a foot ball by not One woman there were four women who left him. He wasFound lamenting upon his bad luck entered Dorothy Claims, Who waved her fingers into his hair, trying her level best to Comfort him.Master what is there that hurts you? May I help?You dear Master!He needed a woman very badly at that Phase of isolated life.. She had been appointed as a helping assistant and Daniel in a fit of passion took Dorothy into herArms. I love you Dorothy and I mean it. Very soon after theyWere lying on the bed and were entangled into each other.. There had been some touches and talks before too. This was the point of culmination.It was a live-in-relationship as both of them wereFrightened of marriage as it had turned adverse.. Dorothy too had divorced her former husband. This went on happily alsoBecause Daniels sister by sheer good luck was married with one boy. She was quite used to take care of cats and bigger cats, Leopard, wolves, fox and flying eagles and flamingos too.Both of them lived quite happily for ten years when the luck took a wrong turn once again.Darcy Smith, the husband of Daniels sister died suddenly as a Result of plane crash near Tokyo. He had gone there on some job assignment. Mary his sister came back with her son TomCrisply back to her brother for shelter and to spend her lifeAlong with her eight years old son named Jerry Stud.The entrance fee to look into his hobby collections had been increased to ten dollars but it was not aHurdle of any kind. They felt an awful surprise to observe hisAnimals he collected them as a hobby could behave quite differently from the animals in a zoo. The monkeys could wish Good Morning Sir or GoodMorning Maam Thank you from Squirrel for being offered ground nuts; and his Parrots could sing My love Marilyn Monroe\ I love her more and so on. His animals hobby of collections became most famous in States and also in U.K. and Russia. It became a tourist spot as well. His hobby of madness became a heavy money maker and it was also listed in several hobbies associations. Quite soon after Dorothy also became pregnant andShe gave birth to a beautiful son who was named Jeans Brian.It is quite obvious that Jeans was naturally the claimant to Daniels assets and his hobby collections were being offeredVery big offers.. Who would be there not to getTempted?His animals would call him and the women who entered into his life wanted a strong man who would lookAfter her all needs. Some of them wanted enough sex and he was short of time. But whenever he came and she came. He kissed her and she kissed him. Some or the other animal wouldCall him at the wrong time and the whole of the sexual passionWould melt as an ice-cream left on the plate to melt remainingUntested and fully wasted. The wild animals are self efficient but when they are made pets, they will certainly call their master for their requirements. Pets are loved and too muchOf care makes a child a spoiled brat. The intrinsic nature of allAnimals are to fend themselves. But the situation goes into obtuse angle when they become pets.On analyzing the problem of divorce in the case of Daniel the issue was that he wanted a wife who should take care of his animals and the women who came in his life needed sex, motherhood and money. There was a storming crash andClash of expectations.I will look after your animals as far as possible but you will keep yourself free at my bed-room time.Yes surely and I will give you enough of my sexO.K. SETTLED Promises were made to be broken wildly. The girls were disappointed and that is why they left. Life is life and Hobbies are only hobbies that should not cross the limits ofSaturation beyond.. We cannot breathe on hobbies. Life has many mysterious unknown demands.Another girl asked ;  Should we eat them sometimes ?No not my pets. You can buy from the market and cook your foodIf something is not available like deer or whitest flamingo.Whats to be done in that case? Nothing has to be done. Control your passion and desires.You wont be allowed to kill my petsThus the matter ran into divergent directions. This man couldNot fulfill the expectations of any girl. The hobby stood as aHurdle into his life that was going on running awkwardly. There was no girl like Hitlers beloved who waited for whole of her life for him.What sort of human beings God has created? There are so many kinds of animals but Man comprises of severalTraits of all animals added together. Yet Man will remain undefined. No statement can be comprehensive and all inclusive. Eating all sorts of animals man himself has become the Worst than all the animals anywhere. Go to sleep Daniel. YOU NEED REST TODAY. Better have yourLamb sandwiches and drink before going to sleep.You are right Dorothy. I must go to sleep. A LONG GOOD SLEEP He muttered to himself.She had planned to murder him through a poisonousAdder. She had left one with the poison. . The market price of the hobby ocean like was seventy lakh dollars Daniel had by now become an eccentric and he spoke theNames of several pets that he felt missing them in his dreams during the night too. But all things that we have collected are to be left after death. Did Daniel not know this simple truth!He had his own son from Dorothy and he had her sisters son,Dean Martin too. He wanted to give some part of his assets toDean as well.Mr. Daniel listens to me carefully. You are seventy four and I am seventy. Before Death separates us let us sell all of the collections and with the seventy lakh dollars let us enjoy ourRemaining lives in the most beautiful places of whole of the world.No I shall not sell my animals hobby collection.Do you think all these animals are going to accompany you?He remained quiet. Thereafter trying to explain: that JeanWill continue with my legacy that I will leave after my deathSHUT UP YOU FOOL I did not give my whole lifeFor a parasite sort of monster in your sister.. Your whole assets are for me and my Son who is in Florida..Next day she continued with the discussion and tried to persuade him.. But the readers know that Daniel was a boy who was not only an obstinate boy but also had remarked that he was his fathersSon not one who was his father slave..Dorothy could not control her temper and pulled out a pistol and shot three bullets into his chest. Daniel fell down never to rise again."
An Untamed Pet,"Sameer was a 16 years old boy and was entomophobic. It was july and his summer vacations.All day he plays with his friend 'Akshay'. Akshay was Samir's classmate and bestfriend.After having his breakfast, Sameer went out as usual to play with Akshay in the ground. They planned their meeting on yesternights.Sameer saw hischum Akshay already arrived at the ground wearing knee pads.""I'm sorry for arriving late.""""You are late as usual Sameer. Now don't waste time, go and wear your pads and grab your bat."", Replied AkshayAfter their cricket practice they left for their houses. They lived in the same colony. On the way they stopped at a tea stall for some snacks and tea.""Today's practice was much better than yesterday's practice."", Akshay said""Yeah! Day by day we are getting better."", Replied SameerSameer was eating his samosa when he felt some tickling on his neck. He put down his Samosa on the plate from his left hand and tea from his right hand. He put his right hand on his neck and grabbed something he was unaware of. When he checked his hand to see what it is, he saw a cockroach. After he saw it, Sameer cried a loud cry and felt unconscious. When he felt unconscious everybody hurled towards him and tried to wake him up. Akshay was in the state of shock. It was when the owner of the stall sprinkled water over his face Sameer woke up from his unconscious state.Akshay was confused over the scene he just witnessed.""What was it? What just happened to you?"", Asked Akshay""I'm entomophobic."", Replied Sameer assuming that Akshay knows what it meant.""Entophobic! What's that?"", Asked Akshay""It's not ENTOPHOBIC but ENTOMOPHOBIC. It is the phobia of insects or in other words I'm scared of them but very much scared."", Replied Sameer""But why you never told me about it. We are best buddies, we were supposed not tokeep secrets hidden from each other. Then Why?""I was afraid that if people came to know about my fear of insects they will make fun of me. But now when you have witnessed it yourself there's nothing to to keep hidden from youand I'm sorry Akshay I should have trusted you as you are the only loyal friend I have ever got in my life.One night Samir woke up from his sleep as he felt dehydrated. He went to the kitchen without switching the lights on. But when he came back from the kitchen he switched on the lights and what he saw on his bed was even worst than the worst of his nightmares. It was a huge SPIDER lying on his bed. He couldn't do anything to get him out from there. He thought of waking his parents up but it was the hours of the night where people were in their deep sleep. He grabbed a chair and placed it infront of his bed with the angle from which he could keep an eye on it.Alarm rang at 7 in the morning waking Sameer up with it. Sameer opened his eyes and his eyes searched for the spider from yesterday but it was nowhere to be found. Infront of his mirror Sameer stood and quickly took off his clothes to check if the spider was in there. But it was also not there. Sameer then quickly ran out from his room but not towards washroom but inside his parents bedroom to fulfillhis sleep from last night.In the afternoon Akshay called him and asked "" Why he didn't came today for practice."" But Sameer lied to him and said that he was not feeling well and that's why he didn't came for practice. After Sameer hanged up the phone call with Akshay, he immediately rushed towards his room and searched each and every cornor of his room but found nothing. Ultimately he became tired and quit his search or in other words 'Hunt' for the spider.After many nights, one night Sameer once again felt dehydrated but this time he had already kept a jug of water inside his room. He switched on the lights of his room and stood up to drink some water. After he kept back the glass on the table, he checked his bed and saw nothing and felt a sense of relief. When he put his legs inside the blanket, he saw the same spider lying on the wall infront of him.Sameer did the same as he did the first time he saw it. He sat down on his bed with his legs crossed, his right hand under his chin and kept staring at it. But after some time he became frustrated as he could no longer take it. He remembered as a kid what his mother used to say to him whenever he was with his mother and saw a stray dog, "" Don't be afraid of him. As long as you will not harm him, he will not do anything to you."" So he once again put his faith on the saying of his mother and switched off the lights. However he couldn't sleep quickly but after some time ultimately went asleep.Next day he woke up and saw spider not there but instead of being anxious about it. He felt comfortable with it. From now on, that spider appeared every night not knowing from where but with the commencement of the new day he disappeared to some kind of Nowhere land.Sameer was now became accustomed to it and it didn't bother him anymore. But paradoxically began to like his untamed pet.Akshay went to Sameer's house one day and decided to stay.He woke up at night and put the flashlight of his mobile on and screamedloudly. Sameer immediately woke up and asked him ""what happened?""""There is a freaking spider on our bed."", Asked Akshay""Oh! sorry I forgot to introduce you. This is my pet cum room mate 'Timmy' or you can call him 'Tim'."
Gardening Hope,"Blanca heard a commotion coming from the garden of the Escondido Community Center. Many voices were excitedly whispering as she entered. She was planning on attending to her vegetables in the tiny plot that the center had given her. She loved having this space to work since living in an apartment was so limiting and snug. But the thing she loved the most was having other people to talk to while she gardened.As she got closer to her plot, she saw her friends and realized that the commotion was coming from her space.""How is that even possible?"" Lenny asked.""The season is not even close to being done for zucchini. And look at those sunflowers. They're enormous,"" Gayle said.""I planted mine the same time she did and theyre not even close to the same size,"" Desiree said.""We did plant them at the same time, Desiree, Blanca interjected, I'm sure it's just a tiny difference.Her friends separated to the point where Blanca could finally see what they were talking about. They were right. Her zucchinis were huge and ready to pick even though Desiree's and Lenny's were just beginning to show. Blanca's sunflowers were at least a foot taller than anyone else's in the garden and the petals were such a striking yellow that it was hard to tell the difference between the petals and the sun's rays.Gayle came up beside Blanca in the sweet grandma way that she had about her and asked, ""What's your secret darling? Magic?""Blanca chuckled nervously, ""I don't know.""Blanca thought about the way she was gardening that year. There was only one change, but that couldn't be it. If it was, then this beautiful harvest is the result of anger and pain. How could that be possible?""Those zucchini look mouthwatering. Can we try one of them?"" Lenny asked.""Sure,"" Blanca was nervous. Would they taste as good as they looked, or would they taste fowl? Could they even be poisonous? The emotion unleashed on those seeds was so intense. How could anything good come from those seeds? ""Let me try it first, just to make sure.""Gayle sighed, ""But of course. You deserve to enjoy your amazing work first.""Lenny smiled and pointed like a giddy child at the largest, greenest zucchini in the plot. Blanca hesitantly cut it off the stem and rinsed it off. She studied it closely. It looked fine. No, not fine, it looked wonderful, better than anything she had ever grown before. She cut off the edge and it smelled like springtime, so fragrant and joyful. She cut off a part to taste and sat down, just in case her initial thought was correct and the vegetable would make her sick. As she bit into it, her taste buds felt like they were dancing with glee. It was more than the best zucchini she had ever tasted.It was a treat.There was plenty to give her friends seconds which they all wanted and even some more to give strangers who were working in the garden and happened to stop by with curiosity.Not only was the vegetable safe to eat, but it also seemed to give everyone extra vitality. Blanca was relieved and wanted to understand. How did the seeds end up being so perfect?The next day, Blanca arrived at work with her harvest to share with her students. She taught eight toddlers and loved showing them as much of the world that she could fit into their tiny classroom. She knew the zucchini and sunflowers would be a source of excitement that day.The day started the way it had for three weeks, with ear-shattering screams coming down the hallway. The classroom door opened and little Camilla was screaming and crying in her mama's arms. She was only a few months older than two, but her anger made it difficult for her mom to keep her balance as she carried her in. ""I'm so sorry. Camilla is having a rough morning, again.""""We all do at times,"" Blanca reassured her as she went to rub Camilla's back. ""Has she seen Papa lately?""""They spent Saturday afternoon together, but it's not the same as seeing him home with us each night. This is our new normal and she's not happy about it.""""It takes time. It's also rough with her abuelita passing away around the same time. It's hard for a two-year-old to understand why a person is not around as much or anymore,"" Blanca tried to console her.""The timing's horrible. I would've scheduled it differently,"" Camilla's mom grieved.""Me too,"" Blanca agreed.A meek, ""Me too,"" came from Camilla.Blanca and Camilla's mom sighed with ""awes"" as they comforted her.""We'll have a good day today,"" Blanca reassured her, ""I know you're working but I hope you find some peace today.""""Thanks, Blanca,"" Camilla's mom sighed as she handed her daughter to Blanca and left.Blanca cuddled Camilla for a moment, noticing how precious she was in her arms. When Camilla seemed ready, Blanca sent her to go play and within a couple of minutes, Camilla was back to screaming and crying. ""It's like a toothache,"" Blanca thought, ""She tolerates the pain for a little while and then she can't take it anymore.""Camilla was an early start student and Blanca's next child would not show up for another fifteen minutes.""Come on,"" Blanca said as she held out her hand to Camilla, ""Let's talk about how the seeds grow again.""Blanca had the book The Tiny Seed and talked about what Camilla liked in the pictures. Blanca also had a box of soil and seeds nearby to go with the story.When Camilla played with the seeds last time, she rubbed the seeds and the soil in her hands. She raised them above her head and then dropped them into the soil over and over again while she watched them fall. She cried quietly while she did this, coating her seeds in tears. Camilla pushed the box to Blanca when she was done and said, Your garden.Yes, I will plant them in my garden, Blanca said and kept her promise. However, Blanca wasnt sure if they would grow. How did those seeds grow so well?This time, Blanca gave her the tomato and cucumber seeds and watched as Camilla held out her chubby little hands and felt for them carefully. Her tear-soaked eyes made it difficult for Camilla to see them. She wrapped her fingers around the seeds and began to rub them. A few seeds fell into the soil and Camilla picked them up one at a time with an exaggerated thumb-index-finger motion. She placed them in the palm of her hand again and began talking while she cried. Blanca noticed that her babbling was an imitation of her mama's intonation as she talked. Camilla dropped the seeds onto the soil and patted them into the dirt. Blanca was able to make out the final words of Camilla's conversation, ""Mama, Papa,"" then a hiccup in her cry, ""Abuelita.""Blanca kept her promise again and planted Camilla's seeds. A week later there was another commotion around Blanca's plot at the garden.""It's shocking,"" Blanca thought as she saw tomatoes and cucumbers that had brilliant, sharp colors, and were huge.""You've got to tell me your secret,"" Desiree surprised Blanca with her enthusiasm as she came up next to her, ""We went to the same store, bought the same supplies, and now look at my garden compared to yours. My tomatoes and cucumbers are babies compared to yours.""""Yeah,"" Blanca could barely manage to speak. She was retracing the steps of the seeds. This couldn't be possible.""Blanca...Blanca.""A tap on the shoulder jolted Blanca back to the garden. She didn't notice that Lenny and Gayle had joined Desiree and they were all waiting for a response. ""Um, hi,"" Blanca said confused, ""What were we talking about?""""Your secret,"" the three said in unison.""It can't be what I think it is. It would be wrong if it's true. What I believe about love and kindness would be a lie,"" Blanca said, Love and kindness should make things grow, not, not what happened.""That sounds intense,"" Desiree said.""Forget about improving my garden,"" Lenny said, ""I need to hear what happened.""""We need to sit,"" Gayle said, ""I want to hear this with no distractions.""Blanca thought for a moment, choosing her words careful to make sure that she protected the privacy of her student. ""I have a toddler in my classroom who is having a tough time. She has a lot of love in her life, but she is experiencing some painful emotions too. She expresses her emotions with screaming and crying. I have been giving her the seeds and soil to explore. It seems to calm her but when she interacts with them, she is still crying. How could something so beautiful grow from such tortured emotions? It doesn't make sense.""The three are confused as they ponder the question.Gayle broke the silence, ""But the emotions are coming from a child.""Desiree nodded in agreement, ""She might be sad or angry, but she's so young. She has all of those wonderful little girl emotions like imagination and hope. Maybe the seeds are getting those qualities too.""""The zucchini tasted wonderful. Let's see what the cucumber and tomatoes taste like,"" Lenny suggested.Blanca broke off some cucumbers and a few tomatoes and passed them around. Each person enjoyed the sweet scent of the tomatoes and then bit into a sublime, wonderful flavor.""I don't taste any sadness or anger here,"" Desiree said.""It tastes like imagination and hope to me,"" Gayle said.Blanca laughed through tears, ""Me too.""That weekend, the garden had new visitors. Blanca told Camilla's mom that she might have a knack for gardening, and it might be a good hobby for them to try together.Camilla squealed with delight as she looked at all of the different plants. ""Look Mama! Pretty.""""This excitement alone is enough motivation for me to bring her back here,"" her mama told Blanca.Desiree, Gayle, and Lenny watched quietly as they saw their new mentor at work. It turned out that Camilla didn't only talk to seeds. She loved to talk and connect with plants as well. In about a week's time, the patrons of the garden would all have some interesting surprises, because Camilla had enough energy to talk to every plant that day. Authors note: Camilla is real. This story is a fantasy in her honor. When I was teaching, I met an angry toddler who struggled to speak and was happiest when she got to do things with her hands, like finger painting and playing with seeds in soil. We planted her seeds along with seeds that our other students planted. Camillas plants always grew at least five inches taller than her classmates.The only explanation that we could come up with was the amount of time she spent playing with the seeds."

Brother Hal,"Once upon a time, in a land behind the mountains, there lived a King and a Queen and their daughter, Princess Eliza. It was a fairly nice kingdom, and everybody who lived there was quite okay with things as they were and with life on the whole. Some people were more happy than others and some were more miserable. Some people had more stuff than they needed and some had less. Some people had loved ones and some were alone.	Princess Eliza was quite happy most of the time. She had more stuff than anybody else because the king and the queen loved her very much and gave her presents all the time. You may think that this would spoil the poor child, but it didn't. Princess Eliza was a very caring and considerate person who had a mind as beautiful as her appearance, and she was always ready to give of her stuff to the poor and needy. But even if she had more than she needed, there was one thing that she wished for more than anything else; more than mechanical birds, more than fountains of chocolate and leather bound books and pencils with pink feathers on top. She wanted a little brother.	You may think that a little girl who was so much loved, not only by her parents, but also by the court and by the people, would have many friends. But it was not so. The royal castle was big and empty and the halls almost echoed with the silence from absent playmates. It was a cold and dark and spiritless environment for a lonely Princess to play in.	The King and the Queen knew this but they could do nothing. When Eliza was born, there had been some complications during the biological process (It shouldn't be necessary to account for the specifics here. For anybody interested, look it up for yourself in any medical handbook on the subject). But it effectively meant that they couldn't have any more children. The King and the Queen had cried a lot when they found out, but then they had poured all the love onto Eliza and treated her like a real princess. Which she was.	But one day in early spring, thirteen years later, a wandering animancer sought audience with the royal family. He was a lean and very dark man who had come from far away on a quest to make the world a better place, and he had heard of the charitable and altruistic Princess and her wish for a brother and decided to offer his services.	I need three drops of blood from the King, he said when he was admitted into the throne room and presented before the King and Queen, and I need three drops of blood from the Queen. And then I need the life essence of an animal, any animal will do as long as it is bigger than a duck, and finally I need a sculpture of a boy-child, and it has to be made of clay that has been dug up from the banks of a whitewater rapids by a virgin.	It was almost easier done than said. The blood was extracted with instruments of gold and crystal by the court medics . An exquisite specimen of piglet was selected and had its life essence removed. A well-known virgin with beautiful, golden hair was sent out to the Rainbow waterfalls to collect the finest, white clay, and a master sculptor was commissioned to make the ultimate statue of his career. It all went well - except that the sculptor had to use a tiny bit of his own clay to finish the statue's right leg. Apart from that, the animancer was satisfied and began the procedure to make a living little brother for the princess.	Several days later, he was done, and to the court and the King and the Queen and to Princess Eliza he presented; Prince Hal.	Prince Hal was a boy with beautiful, golden hair and rainbow coloured eyes. He had a slight limp in his right leg, but it was compensated by his courtly gestures and serious countenance.	Hello father, hello mother, hello sister, he said. Will I be the next King when I grow up?	The royal family thanked the clever animancer for a job well done, threw a big celebratory feast in his honour, paid him handsomely with gold and jewels from the treasury and had his portrait painted and hung in the Hall of Heroes. When he finally left the kingdom, life returned to normal - except that the princess now had a brother. It soon turned out that Prince Hal was a very selfish and uncaring child. He played with his sister - but only when he had nothing else to do, when he hadnt access to a tiny tortoise to torture, or a tired tutor to trick with a whoopee cushion or a water balloon.	One day, when they visited the market together, a kind, old lady gave them each a vanilla strawberry ice cream cone.	Ill have both, Prince Hal said. My sister is so fat she shouldn't be eating ice cream. And then he took both ice cream cones and walked away. Princess Eliza thanked the old lady and followed her brother.	Another time, when they were walking through the city with their guardians, they accidentally entered the poor district. A skinny boy their age, with torn clothes, scars from mistreatment and grime in his face, was sitting on a piece of cardboard with his hand outstretched, begging for alms. Prince Hal went over to him and kicked him hard in the thigh.	Get a job, you filthy pig, he said angrily.	You mustn't do that, Princess Eliza said and pulled him away from the poor boy. (Yes, she was much stronger than him, and that was very fretting to him). It is not right.	You are so stupid, he answered. When I become King, I shall make you poor, so you can come here and marry him. And then he walked away as fast as he could on his limping leg.	A third time, he stole his mothers jewels and hid all of them but one in Elizas bed, under the mattress. Then he told his mother that he had seen Eliza sneaking around outside her private rooms in the middle of the night. The next day, the maids of course found the hidden jewels under the mattress and reported their findings to the Queen. Eliza knew that it was Hal who had stolen the jewels, because she had happened to see him when he was selling the missing one to a jewellery store in town, but she didn't say anything to anybody.	This was the kind of boy Prince Hal was, and Princess Eliza began to wonder why she ever had wished for a little brother in the first place. But he was from the same blood as she, and she had to take care of him and do the best she could of the situation. She tried to show him kindness when he was cruel and patience when he was angry. She tried to teach him that people ought to be nice to each other so that everybody could enjoy life and be happy, and she told him stories and fairy-tales in the evening and sat by his bed when it was late and he was afraid of the dark.	The years went by, but the prince didn't change. If anything, he got even more cruel and showed even less compassion for others, if that was possible. One day, the king was suddenly hit by a bad fever and was confined to his bed. The council was immediately called to a meeting to discuss the royal line of succession, should anything undesirable be the outcome of this unfortunate crisis. All the council members knew about Prince Hal and his unpleasantness, but some of them still believed that the law is the law, and that a male offspring has antecedence before a female one when it comes to choosing a ruler. Others pointed out that Princess Eliza was older and wiser and much, much more suitable to rule a happy and prosperous country.	Prince Hal doesn't know what love is, said the Minister of Affairs.	Prince Hal limps like a duck, said the Minister of Health.	Prince Hal is weak like a wounded wasp, said the Minister of War.	The council could not agree on an acceptable solution so they had to resort to voting. When the votes were counted, the proposition that Princess Eliza would inherit the throne, won by a small margin.	What the council members did not know at this moment was that Price Hal stood behind a pillar in the hall, hidden and listening to every word they were saying. Luckily the King got better and the whole crisis was soon forgotten. But not by everybody. Prince Hal thought quite a lot about what he had heard. Why would a King have to be strong? he wondered. A King can always send someone to lift things for him - if something needs to be lifted. And what was the problem with limping? First of all; Hal was sure he had seen pictures of kings with missing arms or crooked eyes or in an odd-leaning posture. Well, perhaps not. But if he did see one, he wouldn't be surprised. And second of all; a king mostly sat on his throne and ruled. He didn't have to limp around like a common peasant. And finally; love? He couldn't even imagine what that would be good for. He just had to look at his sister to understand that that was a totally crazy idea that only gained others and not oneself. One sunny day, later that year, the Prince and the Princess found the ruins of an old, abandoned castle, not far from the Royal summer palace in the south where they were staying. As they explored it, Princess Eliza found a lamp under a heap of mouldy trash. She thought that maybe it would look good on her bedside table, after it had been cleaned up a bit, but her brother took it from her and threw it on the ground.	Its icky, he said. It reminds me of you.	Used to his manners, she bent down and picked it up again. It was a bit icky, she agreed, so she began rubbing it with a handkerchief.	Immediately, a big, bright, blue cloud sprang from the opening in the burner and a contourless spirit took shape in front of them.	You have freed me from my prison, it said in an eerie voice. I grant you three wishes. All recursive wishes will be nullified. Please state your first wish.	While Eliza was thinking about all the good things she could do with this gift, Prince Hal had already begun wishing.	I wish that I was the strongest man in the world, he shouted. And I wish I didn't limp, he continued, thinking as fast as he could. What was the third thing they had talked about, those bloody council members? Yes. He remembered. I wish I knew what love is!	And he smashed his fists in the floor, so very pleased with himself that he had managed to come up with all three wishes before his sister had even begun wishing. But it didn't feel as good as it used to when he fooled his sister. He almost felt a bit ashamed.	Being the strongest man in the world can cause you trouble if you are not careful. And trouble was just what happened next. Prince Hal's fists had caused the ground to tremble, and bricks and stones began to tumble down from the already weakened ruin walls. There was no time to find a safe way out from the growing inferno. The whole castle was coming down.	They stood, frozen in place, looking at each other without knowing what to do, how to escape. Then Hal looked up to the top of the tower surrounding them and saw a big, flat boulder-sized stone heading straight towards Eliza. He threw himself over her to protect her, and the boulder landed on his back with a nasty sound and sent flashes of pain through his body, so intense that his eyes watered. Soon the boulder was followed by more stones that threatened to bury them both alive.	Hurry, he shouted, standing over her like a protective roof. There is a way out to the right of you. His muscles were about to burst from the heavy load.	I cannot leave you, she shouted back, lying on the ground.	If you don't move - now - youll die. He kicked her in the side, but not hard. Go!	But	He kicked her again, a little bit harder, but still not as hard as he used to. His face was red from the exertion. Im coming after you. I promise. But you must go first.	She began crawling out. It was a tight fit, but with her slim body, she managed to wriggle herself out of the pile of debris.	I love you, sis, she heard him call while more and more stones fell on top of the pile. Im sorry. Im sorry I was such love you	She backed away just in time before the whole tower came down.	When the dust had settled, she called for him. She walked across the mountain of rocks and stones and rubble and called for him for hours. She called for him until the guards that had been sent out to look for them, found her and dragged her home. And she still calls for him, sometimes, in her sleep, calls for her little brother when she is dreaming."
Amandas Unusual Pet,"In her town, shes known to everyone for having such great fondness of any kind of animals  may they be venomous and dangerous. Theyve known her  a fearless lass, often to places they knew not whence she came with scary carnivorous animals with her. Theres one of the times she came with two large scorpions on her shoulders, which that day, made all the inhabitants rush inside their houses and close all their doors as she passed by.She has no parents anymore with her. She grew up in the jungle where all sorts of beautiful animals exist. Perhaps thats the reason why her heart has the wide and big place for animals.And speaking of friends, she has none either, for theyve long sworn to themselves not to get close to a weird lady like her, but that doesnt make her feel sad anymore as all that she needed is given to her already. Whats there to be sad? She has long found a family.May I have a bread, please? She requested one day as she put the money on the cashier table and waited.She received nothing, even a simple okay she thinks would be enough, but that didnt happen.Thank you, maam. She smiled as the cashier looked at her with some kind of disgust look.She accepted that  well, she always does. Thats how her own life works, she thinks. Sometimes a thought comes up to her, that it is perhaps the reason why shes treated this way  becauseshes different in the ways of living. She lives not as normal as the way the other do  they hate animals and she can say thats why animals do hate them too.Its afternoon, and all of a sudden, she was struck by the power of boredom.She lived alone and every time she brought an animal into her house, she would only return them back to where they used to live.Whatever she did to just keep herself busy and ignore that feeling, she couldnt. Somethings pushing and pulling her out of the house. She was all confused and irritated of this feeling, so she decided to go visit the jungle.Yoo hoo! she called, her voice echoed the whole jungle. Im here. Are you guys gonna ignore me?Thats the time she unknowingly plaster on a smile as she heard rustling sounds of dry grasses and there came five scorpions to her.Hey, are you guys all right? How are you doing? Have you eaten for lunch?They raised their pedipalps and made a soft noise, but they dropped them down when an ear-piercing loud roar came; the scorpions ran away back to hole in the tree.Thats all right. You need not to be afraid, my loves. Ill take a look at it.She carefully tread as so as not to trigger whatever animal thats roar came from as it was said that most angry animals hearings are sensible and unpleasant noise will make them angry more.She took a look secretly through the bushes and found left-foot-wounded wolf.Oh, dear, she muttered in shock and worry, she was supposed to be carefully walking to it, but the blood that scattered on the ground had her ran to it without her control and placed her hands gently to its foot. It roared so loud and it freaked her out.Easy, easy, my love, its all right, Im here to help you. It roared again and was trying to smack her.She thought.She tried an attempt of taking steps but its looking at her.I will not hurt you, I promise. I will help you lessen your wounds pain. she said in a worried tone and when she found it slightly softened, she began taking steps toward it. Good boy.Grrr . . .Shh . . . Dont bite me, okay? This might hurt a bit, but its a lot more better than suffer this wound for too long.The wolf dropped itself too hard and it slightly shook the ground she was standing.Where did you get this wound? she asked as she ripped off part of her dress and made it as a tourniquet to stop the blood from gushing out. Did you get into a fight?A growl when she asked that.Before she wrapped it around its left foot, she first let it soak up the oil she has with her.When its foots wrapped already, she gave him a pat on its head.Dont get yourself into a fight next time, okay? Get well very soon. then a kiss before she left him.See you tomorrow, my loves. Her last words after going out of the jungle.In the next day, she went visiting there again in hopes to see that wolf fine and getting better.Did you see it walking away this morning? she asked the scorpion and it shook its head.I wonder where could that be . . . Few seconds and she heard the sound she had just said she wanted to hear.She turned behind and looked at wolf with the tourniquet she made herself tied around its foot.It licked its shoulder and looked at her, whos about to cry like a proud mother.She ran to it and hugged it so tightly. Youre all right. Thank goodness.After that amazing thing she did, she felt more inspired visiting there every day. Every time she went there feels like a celebration of a family. She even gave them names, the scorpions, snakes, frogs, and many more. And that special one, she named it Ashgray.Theres one of those days, she met Raven  a fine-looking man who happened to wander in the jungle, in the moment where she was talking with the animals and his sudden appearance ruined eveything  everyone went back to their homes quickly.She was amazed by which he bravely stood in front of her with those who just ran-away animals and hes gotten some guts to come closer to her.It was she thought the perfect time to feel the feeling of being loved by someone whos just like her  a human. Sometimes we couldnt just live forever like this  we still need love  a humans love. she would say.She fell in love with Raven after the days of meeting and he told her he did so, too  not to mention, they became couple.But ever since Raven came, Ashgray didnt show up anymore. They waited one afternoon, but after how many hours passed, theres no Ashgray appeared; she began to worry.Amanda, hell be all right. He might have been finding anything new. Raven would say that as she has already told him about Ashgray.They celebrated as she didnt want to disappoint everyone and after that, she went all around the jungle after Raven left.Ashgray, where are you? Ashgray! Its been getting dark and lots of mosquitos were taking bite on her skin.Until its completely dark and she hasnt had anything from home, shes getting dizzy.Can you just watch me getting sick here after saving you? she asked without anyone to answer her. Shes a complete fool for doing that.Her knees were trembling after all that walking. She doesnt know where she was, but she thinks shes quite afar from home already.She continued to walk, until her visions getting more blurry and her heads aching angrily  she lost her balance. Every second, she was getting more and more weak due to the coldness, and because of having eaten nothing.Staying there laying flat on the grassy and itchy ground and was being surrounded by mosquitos, her eyes were slowly getting closed and she  collapsed.Amanda, darling, whats wrong with you? Are you all right? Youve got many red spots on your skin. She opened my eyes and almosy jumped out when she found myself on the bed.Who brought me here?What? he asked with confused look.I was at the jungle last night, Raven, seriously, who brought me here? Was it you? she asked in almost choking voice.What are you saying? You went there last night? Are you out of your mind, Amanda? Last night?She looked at him wide-eyed and her eyes were caught by something on the floor  a piece of her dress with blood  the dress she remembered she tied around Ashgrays foot.I-Im sorry, darling, but why did you go there? Was that because of that wolf again? Darling, its a wolf. Look at yourself,He pointed the spots on my shoulders and she stayed silent and still undeniably worrying about it.Lets go. Ill go with you find it.She didnt refuse for thats what she wants  she wants to know what has happened to Ashgray.They wore large coats and brought four sandwiches with them and started off searching.When its almost four in the afternoon, they rested under the tree.After a good half an hour of resting, when they caught each others eyes, he pulled her up close to him and was about to kiss her when there came an angry roar and as her eyes were all closed now, she hasnt seen how Raven got himself thrown and bumped his back into the tree and dropped a knife.Ashgray.An extreme look of shock came all over my face when Ashgray jumped onto him.Ashgray!It didnt listen and that hurts her  how fast Ashgray changed. She could hardly recognizehim anymore.Oh, no, please, stop it!She went to him and tried to make him calm but he was so angry that he almost bit her.Ill kill you! Raven shouted as she found him drawing out his cutlass. But before he could take step, Ashgray took the chance and hovered on top of him and smashed his face  her heart automatically shattered into pieces.Raven . . .She covered her eyes and cried with her knees touched the ground.She was at the verge of crying when she felt something rubbing her shoulder using its fur and when she looked up, it was Ashgray, bringing Ravens bag.She couldnt seem to hate him even after what he did so she took the bag and went through rummaging it  it was all dusty tools and inside the tiniest pocket, her hand touch a paper.She read it.At the moment when she was done, she put her hand on her mouth and sobbed and looked around in hopes to see Ashgray, but he wasnt there anymore.She stood up to find him and he was staring out into space at the back of the tree.Just because of its sight, she couldnt help but feel like her hearts being pierced by millions of sharp needles.She rushed to him and hugged him, tighter than that first hug.Thank you, Ashgray, I didnt know that, thank you. Im sorry.In the midst of hugging Ashgray, the letter thats written on that paper came to echoe inside her mind.Kill her, and youll get paid the money you need for your family."
Smoking is my new hobby,"Smoking is my new hobby. It almost seemed like drinking was something I could stick with, but the hangovers just got worse and worse, and one morning while I was showering and last night's red wine and tortilla chips poured down the drain, I decided to quit. That's not true. I didn't decide to quit, my body did that for me. The next beer I opened smelled like a yeast infection and reminded me of puke before it had even entered my system. I felt like a failure. Drinking, being intoxicated had been such a relief for me, a thing that kept me euforic, when I knew that the only logical thing to do was being sad, even kill myself. I had failed the beer. The one thing it asked of me to grant me happiness I couldn't do. So i took up smoking. I had smoked at parties before, but there was something really satisfying and comically tragic about buying a whole pack and intending on smoking the whole thing myself. I wanted my lungs to hurt. Ironically, I wasn't a very avid smoker. That only took about three smokes. But I pushed through it, just like I had done with the drinking. I never actually got very good at it. But I loved it enough to stick with it. My body reacted horribly to the nicotine, and I never got used to the downright offensive smell of myself after a long night of chain smoking.I had tried other hobbies, but I never had the patience for embroidery. The inevitable stitching and tearing it apart because it never got pretty angered me. I had tried running, but discovered that I was too much of a quitter to run more than a mile at a time. I had tried drugs but it is no fun having a hobby that makes people worry about you.Smoking was a good hobby. I could do it in secret, and I could shower the proof away. It was easier when nobody had to know. At first I couldn't smoke more than a couple a night. But I found that turning on some old blues and just a single glass of red wine did the trick. It was easier to smoke when wine was involved. It was like a higher power had decided that they just went together. With some wine the smoke just flowed easier in and out of my lungs. And I usually imagined myself in the bar where the blues was played, smoking alongside the rest of the crowd because no one knew any better. Getting high on the nicotine and the melancholy didn't come with the side effects and hangovers that drugs and alcohol did. Soon I was able to smoke a whole pack a night. Every second I longed for that secret moment that I shared with the cigarettes. The cool winter air was biting my cheeks as I sat in the window blowing smoke like a steam engine going faster and further with no intention of stopping.Every morning I woke up longing for that shared moment between me and a cigarette. The melancholic evenings had a strange sense of euphoria. This was worth living for. This was perhaps why I lived. Months went by like this. It felt like I was invented for the sole purpose of smoking. One particularly bad morning I woke up, smelling like I had been digested by a combustion plant. I felt nauseous and suddenly it felt like the morning of red wine, tortilla chips and failure all over again. It all just felt wrong. I had a strange sensation like something was wrong in the fabric of the universe. Or maybe it was just one of those cases where I felt so sick that everything felt wrong.I came down with the flu and I kept feeling as ill as ever. Of course I couldn't smoke due to the trouble I had swallowing and breathing. I felt pathetic. Not only had I never felt worse, my body had once again refused something I loved doing. I put off calling the doctor. I guess Im just one of those people. I called after a week of feeling more and more like I wanted to kill myself because everything hurt so bad. And of course because my mom had angrily told me over the phone that I was immature for not taking my health seriously.My mom could get me to do things like no one else. She was the one who got me to quit the drugs and start running instead. She was really good at getting me to start things. But i was just really good at failling.  They send somebody to pick me up. I felt embarrassed. I could have taken a cab. Actually I probably couldn't, but I didn't want them fussing.The doctor performed every examination in the book. I felt light headed and my vision was blurred like I had fog stuck in my eyes. I couldn't tell you what happened in the examination room, every memory got covered in the uncertain haze of fever. They sent me home with some antibiotics and told me that they would call in a couple of days if any of the examination results looked worrying. I slept for two days straight, and was woken up by that very call. On the other line was the doctor. Not the secretary, which I found peculiar.His voice sounded torn. Just like my moms did that time she had to tell us that her and dad was getting a divorce. She tried to keep a happy face so we wouldn't understand that this was something to cry about. Hi, we need you to come back in. Your test results were a little irregular. Well send someone to pick you up. I came back in and had an MRI-scan. That was the day my body truly failed me. That was the day I was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer."
Love The Hobby You Do !,"When I hear such statements in my life ,I used to think what might be the reason for them not getting their work fulfilled. Why are they ending with out completing the task.Many questions do arise in my mind thinking of the actual reason for their delay.By the way,let me first introduce you to me & my environment & then I will take you to the exact intent of what has happened & what I realized from the saying which I mentioned above.I am a student ,an undergraduate pursuing bachelors in technology in the stream of electronics in a reputed university located in my state of living . Being part of the university academic schedule, I always used to be in the classroom ,fully busy in listening to lectures. When I get a day off or a kind of dept holiday in the mean,then I will spend my time in fulfilling my hobbies. My most interested hobbies are to write about what I am actually interested in at the moment & will also design the content related posters or posts,which are user friendly in nature. Apart from the hobbies,I do spend certain time on my academic scheduled works like assignments,ALM's and will spend the rest of my time getting inspired from the great stories of women from the podcasts & YouTube stories.And this is on the day when I am a bit free with no lectures but was asked to come to campus so as to submit an assignment. I was waiting in the lobby for the time to rotate to reach 12 pm ,where I will get the chance to meet my trainer to submit all my assignments. I was simply sitting in a chair & scrolling the feed on Instagram. Then I suddenly heard a girl speaking to her friend ,in a low voice ,in a sorrow tone ,telling that she is a bit worried. By listening to her statement,My attention slowly moved to her, eager to know the reason for her sorriness.She slowly started continuing the statement saying that : ""I am really worried because I don't know why I am like this today in an helpless way."" Her friend asked to tell her what exactly had happened. She continued by telling to her that she is missing her passion ,she is out of her world of dreams and living a life which she is not actually intended to. This made me question myself that ""What ,Is she telling the truth!? "".While i was in my query mode,I heard her continuing in expressing her exact view.She told that:"" Being busy in academics,I am not being able to concentrate on what I am actually interested in.I am not getting enough time to build my career as I expected. I am even trying to make time,I am only getting chance to manage only one of my passions as hobby in a day.This is the reason for my sassiness of the day.``Then her friend asked ""If that's the reason,Why can't you quit spending time on your hobbies & just focus on your academic career. Then with no second gap,The worried girl replied in an anger tone ""What are you talking about !? These are my true dreams ,my passions,I thought of making them as a day routine,Just imagine how much i love them for the reason I even decided to make them as a daily hobby.""After listening to it,her friend apologized in a pleasant tone & she requested that it will not be repeated again & again.By listening to all these, I was completely stuck thinking about what is happening today. Why are the things not organized? Her sassiness really disturbed me. I questioned myself that am I really being able to manage things.Then my brain answered me that I am not actually managing work. I am already skipping many tasks that I dreamt off & was into only very minute things on the list. Then I realized that I am also in ways similar to her but just a step ahead when compared to her as I am capable of managing at least more than one hobby a day.This made my thinking much deeper into the thought. I compared myself from the pastto the present ,there is no major change in me. I am just still working on things to get on with a change but its still not into the track of what I am expecting. I started digging the reasons for not completing or not even initializing my hobbies of the day. I explored all the reasons from the day of my dreams & ended up with certain reasons where I felt very bad.The worst reasons that i figured out are as below :All the above mentioned reasons that i figured out are completely waste. They are not at least the proper reasons one can figure out.They are no way valid in showcasing to myself that I am actually busy & thats the reason why I didnt initiate the other few which I thought of. This way of exploring my past made me stuck for a while. It made me realize that its not about picking multiple different hobbies in a day to work for. Its all about how we manage to do & how we pay attention in aspiring for the job we do,Loving what we do is the real love we receive as a result no matter what kind of hobby it is.Also understood that need to stick to whatever hobby we choose,explore all the ways of getting succeeded in it. From then,I decided to overcome all the above mentioned tasks & start working on my paths.The new learning that i inculcated is :Its all about the way you organize things,the way you schedule tasks & the way you love the work you do!"
Marlene and the Cockroach,"Nine-year-old Marlene hated cockroaches more than anything else. She could not bear the sight of them and would immediately scream for help. Daaaaaaddy! Another one! she would say, with tears running down her tanned cheeks. Daddy would always get them and then carry little Marlene to the bed. He was tall and had black curly hair and small eyes that almost completely transformed into one big wrinkle when he smiled, which was often. They are harmless, Marlene, he would say, but no matter how many times she heard those words, they never sank in. All she could see was a crunchy, hairy and pointy little being which was much faster than her, and which appeared to know her every thought and smell her fear. Marlene and her father lived in a house of two rooms in a hot, coastal rural town. They lived close to a small river where he fished from time to time, so Marlenes house often smelled like a swamp or like fish. The walls, which used to be white, were now of a light grey color and decorated by Marlenes drawings of odd-looking fruits with eyes, legs and arms. Wake up, Marlene were Marlenes least favorite words. They meant that it was time to get ready to go to school. Marlene would rather stay home and go explore the trees that lead to the stream. One of the trees, which had a cavity near the bottom in which Marlene sometimes stuffed pebbles and little dolls, was her favorite. She loved visiting it. Wake up, Marlene, she heard her fathers words again and opened her eyes suddenly, hit by the fear that they would arrive late to school again and her father would get in trouble. Daddy was a math, science and music teacher at the local school, which was about 15 minutes away (walking distance) and consisted of two small buildings that were still unpainted, a small playground with a discolored red slide and a swing made out of rope and wood, and two basketball rims with strings attached to them that revealed they once had nets. Sometimes, Marlenes father had to stay in school longer, so he instructed her to walk home and start her homework. To Marlene, these walks back home were a secret adventure that she sometimes shared with Janet, her closest friend. They balanced their bodies on the edge of the unpaved road, trying to avoid, at the same time, the few cars that drove on it and the bushes to its side. My father said that there were snakes in the bushes, said Marlene, with suspense in her voice and a glimmer in her eyes. I saw a big one the other day, replied Janet. Lets run home. One, two, threego. * Of all her memories, only the most remote and simple ones remain. In particular, the ones from childhood, but not all of them. Marlene, now ninety-four, has forgotten all about the day in which her father was killed. The memories that she built after that, with hard work, love and dedication, are now vague and inconsistent. Sometimes, when some of her thirteen grandchildren visit her, she does not really recognize them or confuses them with people that she used to know. She calls Mile, her youngest grandchild, Janet. She does resemble Janet a lot, but no one knows that, as only Marlenes father had gotten to know her childhood friend. Seven days before Marlene turned eleven, Janets family was forced by dangerous, bad people terrorizing her small rural town to pack their things and leave. Janet! Janet! Dont leave! I have an idea. Tell your mom that you will stay with me and daddy and live with us for a year, Marlenes words are slow and can hardly be understood by ten-year-old Mile, who nods following the instructions of her father, standing opposite to her, on the other side of Marlene, who now sits on a wheelchair. * At the home, there are no pets allowed, but Marlenes nurse, Gilbert, decided to make an exception that no one must know of. He is forty-three and studied to become a nurse at thirty-six after failing to launch his career as a writer, to which he dedicated most of his life. Daddy, daddy, dont kill it! cried Marlene that day in her shaky voice, with her eyes almost completely filled with tears. Gilbert, who had once had a spider as a pet, was not afraid of cockroaches, so he had successfully trapped it in a plastic cup after several attempts. This cockroach was huge. To Marlene, it almost resembled a human being, which is why, despite the strong fear of cockroaches that she developed in childhood, she did not want this one to die. It was still crunchy and hairy, but its huge antennae and rounder body somehow made it more amiable. Gilbert could not find the words to explain to Marlene that she could not have the cockroach stay in her room too long, so he just found a bigger plastic container, punched several tiny holes to it, and put the cockroach in it. Gilbert was short and a little bit chubby, but his arms and hands were quick. He had been in several bands, playing the guitar and the drums, but always ended up hating all the music he helped create. For the sixteen days in which Marlene had a cockroach as a pet, Gilbert placed it under the bed every time someone visited her, covering it with a small towel in front of her so that she knew that nothing would happen to it. Wake up, Marlene, she heard at dawn. Then she looked at the plastic container next to her bed and smiled. They are harmless, she said to herself, before going back to a particular day in her childhood in which her daddy brought her a new doll back from school. One of the parents gave me this doll for you, he said with his deep, caring voice, you can put it in the tree if you want, but dont lose it. Marlene looked around her. The room was all white, not light grey, and it smelled like lavender and alcohol, not like a swamp or fish. She felt lost and very afraid. She looked down at bony hands and did not recognize them. She did not recognize that body. She did not recognize the yellow pajama which that body was wearing. She was speechless. She looked to the floor and saw a plastic container. Inside of it, there was a cockroach. Daaaaaddy! Another one! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Gilbert rushed through her door and saw her there, sitting on her chair, trembling. In her eyes, he saw panic and fear like he had never seen before. It was as though her eyes were seeing something terrible, something that could not be spoken. Gilbert felt guilty about letting her keep the cockroach. Hit by panic and without really thinking about it, he opened the box and squeezed it to death with a small book that he carried in his pocket. Marlene started calming down and mumbling: Arent you going to carry me to bed, daddy? Gilbert, who was disinfecting his book with the alcohol that he kept on one of the little tables in Marlenes room, turned around to see her mumbling and gently closing her eyes at the same time."

Cabin fever,"How did I come to be here? Well, let me prepare some tea and food while I tell you my story. You get settled by the fire; you must be frozen. It was some years ago, I am not sure how manyit could be five or fifteen; time seems not to move here. Like you, I climbed that rocky path on the north side. Did they tell you down below not to take it? Yes, they told me, too. But my sense of adventureand my pride, it must be saidgot the better of me.For half a day I trudged up the path, which, as you know, gets verysteep and tricky after the first full bend. I was having problemsslipping on the shale, making very little headway. I could have gone back, and that would have been the sensible thing to do. But my pride again. So I went on, and in the late afternoon, when the snow started, I found an overhanging rock that afforded me some shelter. It snowed for two whole days. I finished the little food I had brought with me and got to thinking thatI might never leave the mountain. Then on the third day the blizzard stoppedand I dug my way out of the snow that had accumulated around the rock. It was a brilliant morning, the sun throwing sparkles onto the immaculate white carpet that covered everything around. I guessed the direction of the invisible path and, though feeling very weak, endeavoured to continue on my way. It was hard going. I did not have my snow shoes, and my legs disappeared up to the knees with each step. But I knew that it was a question ofgoing on or going back, and while my legs were faltering, my intent was not. When I reached the top of the first ridge on that third day, I was horrified to note that the summit and the valley beyond were much further away than I had imagined. I made a quick assessment of the situation and came to the conclusion that without food or snow shoes, and with the fatigue I was already feeling, there was no way I could make it now. So I took the painful decision to go back, and I was actually about to turn when I saw the first wolf. It was standing near the tree-line to my right. I was downwind from it, so it could not detect me by scent, but I do not know why it failed to see me. Then two or three other wolves emerged from the line of trees. I did not wait around to let them spot me. I waded through the snow and plunged into the pines to my left. The wolves started howling behind me, and I just kept going. After what seemed like hours, but it could have been mere minutes, the howling began to fade and I breathed a little more easily. The problem was that by now I was completely disoriented. Following my tracks back might have meant coming up against the wolves, so I slogged blindly downhill. Then I saw it. Through the tops of the pines, a thin plume of smoke. There is no smoke without fire, and here on the mountain, I surmised, no fire without shelter. So I made for the smoke, and after another half hour or soI came across this cabin, as you did.How is the tea? Warming, yes? made me tea, the man whowas in the cabin before me. He told me how he had come to be here, rather like I am telling you. How he had also got lost and had come across the cabin. After a few minutes, my eyes began to droop. I imagined that it was the fatiguethe lack of food, the climb. The man smiled at me, and that smile brought me to my senses; it was an odd mixture of pity and euphoria and it chilled my blood.As did what he said next. Before you slip away, he whispered, not unkindly, I have to tell you what is happening and what will happen next. The thing I have put in your tea is sending you to sleep. It will be a deep sleep. When you wake, I will be gone, and the cabin will be yours. You will try to leave but you will be unable to; something will hold you back at the door. I do not know what that something is. I wish I did. Like me, you may spend your time here wondering just that. You will stay here until the next person comes to take overto be the next keeper of the cabin. This is exactly what the person before me said, and she told me thatI was to pass this message on to you, as you will pass it on to the next.I can see that you are nearly gone. Please do not think badly of me. When you wake, it will be as the old man before me said. Do not panicI know that is easy to say. But there really is nothing you can do, only wait. Wait for the next.And so, my friend,I bid you farewell.Now sleep. aaaaaaa a. a a. a a aa. a a. a a a a. a a a a a a a. a a a. aa. a a aaaa aaa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaa a a a. a a a a. a a a a. a a. a a a. a a. a a. a a. a aa. a aa a. a aa. a a a a. a a a a. a a. a a a a. a a a. a a a a. a a a. a a a a a a a a a a. a a a. a a a a a a. a a"
First Christmas Snow,"On Christmas Eve morning Jenny mouse woke to the sounds of great excitement from her children.Dressing as quickly as she could she rushed downstairs to see what was happening. Every pane of glass in the kitchen window was covered by a head looking out at the big white things falling down from the sky. When the children saw Jenny, they rushed toward her, all talking all at the same time. One at a time, she smiled, as she looked down at little Pip, who was jumping up and down in her usual excited way. ""The big white things falling out of the sky are all over the garden"",Pip squealed. Jenny was in the middle of explaining that it was called snow, when she heard the familiar voice of Mr Quiggle rat outside the kitchen door. The girls ran so fast to let him in they almost knocked her over. After the excitement had quietened down a bit, Quiggle told them he had come to take them to the pond. All the garden friends were meeting there to arrange the Christmas Day party. The children quickly wrapped up in their warmest clothing, and they all set off for the garden pond. When they arrived everyone was looking very sad. Wetty, the rain beetle, was looking more miserable than any of the others and explained to Jenny mouse that they couldn't have their Christmas Day party because Capstick cats human had put him out into the garden shed to sleep, and so it wouldn't be safe for them. We usually decorate a Christmas tree and give presents to everyone, said Wetty. It just won't be the same this year, but they all agreed that it was better to be safe and so they all went off home. That evening Jenny tried to make it extra special for her children's first Christmas. They each hung their stocking above the fireplace with a small note to old Santa mouse pinned onto each one.  Little Pip, the youngest, wanted a baby doll. Johnathan, the eldest, wanted some new boots. Klara, born after Johnathan, which she hated, asked for a vanity set. Lena was next, she wanted a new apron so she could keep herself clean when she helped Jenny in the kitchen. Then, lastly, came Ropey. He loved to hunt so he had asked for a bow and arrow. Christmas morning arrived and the children were up very early to see if Santa mouse had been. They each lifted their own stocking down from the mantle, and peered inside. Pip gave a squeal of delight as she lifted a little pink mouse doll out of her stocking. Oh thank you so much, Santa she shouted up the chimney. Lena was trying on her beautiful new blue frilly apron and Johnathan was marching up and down admiring his new boots. Klara was unusually quiet, brushing her hair with her new hairbrush whilst admiring her reflection in her new mirror. However, Ropey's stocking was EMPTY.  Everyone gasped. Jenny noticed a note, from Santa, pinned to the bottom of the stocking.Ropey read it aloud... Your bow and arrowsAre not here, butI always try to pleaseYou will find oneIn the gardenNear the large fir treesLove Santa x Ropey dressed himself quickly in his warmest coat and mitts and off he went into the garden to find his bow and arrows. Jenny shouted after him to be carefuland watch out for Capstick cat. It was snowing again, but they had presents to deliver, so they dressed warmly, and off they all went toward Clinger frogs house at the other side of the pond. Jenny had just given Wetty rain beetle and Quiggle rat their gifts, when Clinger frog came hopping over to them out of breath and croaking that Capstick was on his way through the garden and would be there at any moment. No one knew which way to run. Clinger frog told them it was best to cross the frozen pond to his house as it was the nearest. Jenny was so afraid and desperately tried to hide her fear from her children. She had never walked on a frozen pond before, in fact, she had never stood on any ice. Gathering her courage, she stepped with her children onto the icy pond. She could feel the cold penetrating through her shoes to her feet. It was very slippery and she knew she had to be very careful not to fall for the sake of the children. They were almost across the pond, when they heard Capstick meowing and hissing behind them. Suddenly, Capstick gave a loud Meow and stopped in the middle of the pond. When they turned to see what was happening they saw him jumping up and down in pain. They looked beyond Capstick, and there at the other side of the pond was Ropey with his bow and arrows. He was firing large pine needles at Capsticks feet which made him jump around. Suddenly there was a loud crack and the pond ice opened...right where Capstick was standing. Down into the cold pond he sank, meowing even louder than before. Quiggle rat rushed over to Ropey and lifted him high onto his shoulders. ""You're our little hero, he said. Ropey didnt feel like a hero, he was actually worried about Capstick. He had wanted him to run away home, not to fall into the pond. Ropey was busy trying to think of how he could help Capstick out of the pond, when a small human arrived.  He pulled him out of the water by his collar, shook him very hard, and told him there would be no more prowling for him for a day or two.  When the garden friends heard that, they gave a tremendous cheer. They would now be able to have their Christmas Day party. The grownups chatted happily as they decorated one of the small fir trees. The children built several snowmen, whilst, Quiggle frogs children hopped around them throwing snowballs. Mrs earwigs children were having a great time, sledging down the snow piled up at the side of the rain barrel. Jenny mouse smiled, then she stepped once again onto the frozen pond, this time with no fear. This time she was going to learn how to skate with her children. They all knew that this was going to be a truly wonderful Christmas, that Capstick couldn't spoil. All Capstick could do was watch them from inside his cottage, his nose pressed hard against the window pane."
THE FOUR DWARF WITH FOUR  SEASONS,"There was once a woman who had two girls. One was her own daughter, the other a stepchild. Holena , her own daughter, she loved dearly, but she couldn't bear even the sight of Marushka, the stepchild. This was because Marushka was so much prettier than Holena. Marushka, the dear child, didn't know how pretty she was and so she never understood why, whenever she stood beside Holena, the stepmother frowned so crossly.	Mother and daughter made Marushka do all the housework alone. She had to cook and wash and sew and spin and take care of the garden and look after the cow. Holena, on the contrary, spent all her time decking herself out and sitting around like a grand lady.	Marushka never complained. She did all she was told to do and bore patiently their everlasting fault-finding. In spite of all the hard work she did she grew prettier from day to day, and in spite of her lazy life Holena grew uglier.	""This will never do,"" the stepmother thought toherself. ""Soon the boys will come courting and once they see how pretty Marushka is, they'll pay no attention at all to my Holena. We had just better do all we can to get rid of that Marushka as soon as possible.""	So they both nagged Marushka all day long. They made her work harder, they beat her, they didn't give her enough to eat, they did everything they could think of to make her ugly and nasty. But all to no avail. Marushka was so good and sweet that, in spite of all their harsh treatment, she kept on growing prettier.	One day in the middle of May  Holena took the notion that nothing would do but she must have a bunch of fragrant snowdrops  to put in her bodice.	""Marushka!"" she ordered sharply. ""I want some snowdrops . Go out to the forest and get me some.""	""Good heavens, my dear sister!"" cried poor Marushka. ""What can you be thinking of? Whoever heard of snowdrops  growing under the Heat of May ?""	""What, you lazy little slattern!"" Holena shouted. ""You dare to argue with me! You go this minute and if you come back without snowdrops  I'll kill you!""	The stepmother sided with Holena and, taking Marushka roughly by the shoulder, she pushed her out of the house and slammed the door.	The poor child climbed slowly up the mountain side weeping bitterly. All around the stony   mountains  with no track of man or beast in any direction to move  . Marushka wandered on and on, weak with hunger and sweating cause of hot weather .	""Dear God in heaven,"" she prayed, ""take me to yourself away from all this suffering.""	Suddenly ahead of her she felt a cold breeze . She struggled towards it and found at last that it came from a giant cold wave on the top of the mountain. Around the wave  there were four stones , one of them much bigger and higher than the rest. Four men were seated on the stones. one   of them was  very old and white;one was   not so old; one was  middle-aged; and one  was  beautiful youth . They did not talk. They sat silent gazing at the cold breeze . They were the Four Seasons .	For a moment Marushka was frightened and hesitated. Then she stepped forward and said, politely:	""Kind sirs, may I cool my self from your cold wave ? I am seating with heat .""	Great Summer nodded his head and Marushka reached her sweated  fingers towards the wave .	""This is no place for you, my child,"" Great summer  said. ""Why are you here?""	""I'm hunting for Snowdrops ,"" Marushka answered.	""snowdrops ? This is no time to look for snowdrops  with summer on the ground!""	""I know that, sir, but my sister, Holena, says I must bring her snowdrops from the forest or she'll kill me and my mother says so, too. Please, sir, won't you tell me where I can find some?""	Great summer  slowly stood up and walked over to the youngest season . He handed him a long staff and said:	""Here, winter , you take the high seat.""	So winter  took the high seat and began waving the staff over the cold breeze . The wave  blazed up and instantly the snow all about began to fall . The trees filled with snow as icecream on cone ; the little buds of snowdrops  appeared; and, lo, it was winter !	While Marushka looked, snowdrops  began to peep out from among the leaves and soon it was as if a great blue quilt had been spread on the ground.	""Now, Marushka,"" March cried, ""there are your snowdrops ! Pick them quickly!""	Marushka was overjoyed. She stooped down andgathered a great bunch. Then she thanked the Months politely, bade them good-day, and hurried away.	Just imagine Holena and the stepmother's surprise when they saw Marushka coming home through the stony mountains  with her hands full of snowdrops . They opened the door and instantly the fragrance of the flowers filled the cottage.	""Where did you get them?"" Holena demanded rudely.	""High up in the mountain,"" Marushka said. ""The ground up there is covered with them.""	Holena snatched the flowers  and fastened them in her waist. She kept smelling them herself all afternoon and she let her mother smell them, but she never once said to Marushka:	""Dear sister, won't you take a smell?""	The next day as she was sitting idle in the chimney corner she took the notion that she must have some oranges  to eat. So she called Marushka and said:	""Here you, Marushka, go out to the forest and get me some oranges .""	""Good heavens, my dear sister,"" Marushka said, ""where can I find oranges  this time of year?Whoever heard of oranges  growing under the summer season ?""	""What, you lazy little slattern!"" Holena shouted. ""You dare to argue with me! You go this minute and if you come back without oranges , I'll kill you!""	Again the stepmother sided with Holena and, taking Marushka roughly by the shoulder, she pushed her out of the house and slammed the door.	Again the poor child climbed slowly up the mountain side weeping bitterly. All around the stony mounatin with sun on top  with no track of man or beast in any direction tio move . Marushka wandered on and on, weak with hunger and shaking with cold. At last she saw ahead of her the glow of the same cool breeze  that she had seen the day before. With happy heart she hastened to it. The Four seasons (the drawf )  were seated as before with Great summer  on the high seat.	Marushka bowed politely and said:	""Kind sirs, may I cool  myself at your cool breeze ? I am sweating  with heat .""	Great January nodded and Marushka reached her sweat  fingers towards the breeze .	""But Marushka,"" Great summer  said, ""why are you here again? What are you hunting now?""	""I'm hunting for oranges ,"" Marushka answered.	""oranges ? But, Marushka, my child, it is summer and oranges  do not grow in the summer .""	Marushka shook her head sadly.	""I know that, sir, but my sister, Holena, says I must bring her oranges  from the forest or she will kill me and my mother says so, too. Please, sir, won't you tell me where I can find some?""	Great summer  slowly stood up and walked over to the season  who sat opposite him. He handed him the long staff and said:	Here, winter , you take the high seat.""	So winter  took the high seat and began waving the staff over the giant cool wave . The breeze  blazed high and with the cold  the snow all about began to fall  instantly. The earth was filled with snow ; the trees decked themselves in layers of snow ; the birds began to sing; flowers bloomed and, lo, it was winter again! Presently little oranges  covered the trees , Marushka saw that they were ripe oranges .	""Now, Marushka,"" winter  cried, ""there are your oranges ! Pick them quickly!""	Marushka picked an apronful of oranges . Then she thanked the Months politely, bade them good-bye, and hurried home.	Just imagine again Holena and the stepmother's surprise as they saw Marushka coming through the tony mountains  with an apronful of oranges !	They opened the door and instantly the fragrance of the oranges  filled the house.	""Where did you get them?"" Holena demanded rudely.	""High up in the mountain,"" Marushka answered, ""under the orange trees.""	Holena took the oranges  and gobbled and gobbled and gobbled. Then the stepmother ate all she wanted. But it never occurred to either of them to say:	""Here, Marushka, you take one.""	The next day when Holena was sitting idle, as usual, in the chimney corner, the notion took her that she must have some brussels . So she called Marushka and said:	""Here you, Marushka, go out to the forest and get me some brusells .""	""But, my dear sister,"" Marushka gasped, ""where can I find brussels  in summer ?""	""What, you lazy little slattern, you dare to argue with me! You go this minute and if you come back without brussels  I'll kill you!""	For the third time the stepmother sided with Holena and, taking Marushka roughly by the shoulder, pushed her out of the house and slammed the door.	So again the poor child went out to the forest. All around the stony mountains  with no track of man or beast in any direction to move . This time Marushka hurried straight to the mountain top. She found the Drawf with Seasons  still seated about their cool breeze or cold wave  with Great summer  still on the high stone.	Marushka bowed politely and said:	""Kind sirs, may I cool myself at your cool breeze ? I am sweating with heat , summer  nodded and Marushka reached her sweat fingers towards the breeze .	""Why are you here again, Marushka?"" Great summer  asked. ""What are you looking for now?""	""brussels ,"" Marushka answered. ""My sister, Holena, says I must bring her some brussels  from the forest or she will kill me, and my mother says so, too. Please, sir, won't you tell me where I can find some?""	Great summer  slowly stood up and walked over to one of the drawf . He handed him the long staff and said:	""Here, winter , you take the high seat.""	So winter  took the high seat and began waving the staff over the blizard . The  cool breeze blazed  and glowed. Instantly the snow appeared . The fields about looked white . From the trees the leaves  ducked with snow  one by one and a cool breeze scattered them over the stubble. There were not many flowers, only the winter flowers  on the hillside.	Presently Marushka saw ground  filled with  brussels  under the  plant .	""There, Marushka,"" winter  called, ""there are your brussels  . gather  them quickly.""	Marushka reached up and picked one brussel. Then she picked another.	""That's enough, Marushka!"" winter  shouted. ""Don't pick any more!""	Marushka obeyed at once. Then she thanked the Months politely, bade them good-bye, and hurried home.	Holena and her stepmother were more surprisedthan ever to see Marushka coming through the stony mountains  with brussels  in her hands. They let her in and grabbed the brussels  from her.	""Where did you get them?"" Holena demanded.	""High up on the mountain,"" Marushka answered. ""There are plenty of them growing there.""	""Plenty of them! And you only brought us two!"" Holena cried angrily. ""Or did you pick more and eat them yourself on the way home?""	""No, no, my dear sister,"" Marushka said. ""I haven't eaten any, truly I haven't. They wouldn't let me pick any more than two. They shouted to me not to pick any more.""	""I wish the lightning had struck you dead!"" Holena sneered. ""I've a good mind to beat you!""	After a time the greedy Holena left off her scolding to eat one of the brussel  . It had so delicious  flavor that she declared she had never in all her life tasted anything so good. Her mother said the same. When they had finished both brussels  they began to wish for more.	""Mother,"" Holena said, ""go get me my shawl . I'm going up the mountain myself. No use sending that lazy little slattern again, for she would only eatup all the brussels  on the way home. I'll find that tree and when I pick the brussels  I'd like to see anybody stop me!""	The mother begged Holena not to go out in such weather, but Holena was headstrong and would go. She threw her shawl  over her shoulders and off she went up the mountain side.	All around the stony mountains  with no track of man or beast in any direction to move . Holena wandered on and on determined to find those wonderful brussels. At last she saw a light in the distance and when she reached it she found it was the giant cool breeze  about which the Dwarf ( Four seasons )  were seated.	At first she was frightened but, soon growing bold, she elbowed her way through the circle of men and without so much as saying: ""By your leave,"" she put out her hands to the breeze . She hadn't even the courtesy to say: ""Good-day.""	Great summer  frowned.	""Who are you?"" he asked in a deep voice. ""And what do you want?""	Holena looked at him rudely.	""You old fool, what business is it of yours who I am or what I want!""	She tossed her head airily and walked off into the forest.	The frown deepened on Great summer 's brow. Slowly he stood up and waved the staff over his head. The breeze  died down. Then the sky grew dark; an hot  wind blew over the mountain.	Holena could not see a step before her. She struggled on and on. Now she ran into a tree,  she fell onto a stone . In spite of her warm  shawl  her limbs began to weaken and grow numb.	Did Holena at last begin to feel sorry that she had been so wicked and cruel to Marushka? No, she did not. Instead, the hotter  she grew, the more bitterly she reviled Marushka in her heart, the more bitterly she reviled even the good God Himself.	Meanwhile at home her mother waited for her and waited. She stood at the window as long as she could, then she opened the door and tried to peer through the storm. She waited and waited, but no Holena came.	""Oh dear, oh dear, what can be keeping her?"" she thought to herself. ""Does she like those brussels  somuch that she can't leave them, or what is it? I think I'll have to go out myself and find her.""	So the stepmother put her shawl  about her shoulder and set out.	She called: ""Holena! Holena!"" but no one answered.	She struggled on and on up the mountain side. All around the stones  lay deep with no track of man or beast in any direction.	""Holena! Holena!""	Still no answer.	The heat spread more fastly . The hot weather began to change into more hottness .	At home Marushka prepared the dinner and looked after the cow. Still neither Holena nor the stepmother returned.	What can they be doing all this time?"" Marushka thought.	She ate her dinner alone and then sat down to work at the distaff.	The spindle filled and daylight faded and still no sign of Holena and her mother.	""Dear God in heaven, what can be keeping them!"" Marushka cried anxiously. She peered out the window to see if they were coming.	The storm had spent itself. The wind had died down. But not a living creature was in sight. Marushka knelt down and prayed for her sister and mother.	The next morning she prepared breakfast for them.	""They'll be very sweating  and hungry,"" she said to herself.	She waited for them but they didn't come. She cooked dinner for them but still they didn't come. In fact they never came, for they both melt  to death on the mountain.	So our good little Marushka inherited the cottage and the garden and the cow. After a time she married a farmer. He made her a good husband and they lived together very happily."
Misty Mountain,"Misty MountainA lone figure was struggling to move through the thick snow upon Misty Mountain. The world was ruined long ago and only a few fortunate and desolate individuals survived the influx of the inner aliens. It had been more than twenty years since the invasion and nature had revitalised itself miraculously. It had again become pristine and the snow upon Misty Mountain was particularly sparkling that morning.Eventually, the man reached a tiny log cabin, which was leaning against an enormous oak tree, and entered it. The interior of the cabin was pretty austere. There was a huge red Bukhara that ran almost from wall to wall; a low, round table with a few cushions around it, a framed poem hanging on the wall, and an Indian sitar in the corner. The man took the sitar and started playing.The sound of the music took his mind back to the world that had perished more than twenty years ago. He went to a concert one evening that lasted twelve hours. Four different Indian masters were playing that night in South Hall in London. Hari Prasad Chaurasia was the last to play into the wee hours of the morning. At the end, when he took the Krishna Lila flute, or whatever it was called, the crowd was ecstatic. After the concert, the man and his good friend Paul walked all the way back to Swiss Cottage. Summertime is magical.Shanti, a beautiful London girl of Caribbean descent, had seen it coming. She saw them before anybody else  inner aliens were creeping in upon our lives, unnoticed by everyone but Shanti. She was talking about them all the time, and he got really bored with it:Shanti, cant you talk about anything else, please?!Of course, I can, you idiot, but this is what we all need to know. Now! Weve been drifting from one another. People are locked out in their sacred boxes and focused upon yet another silly box that mostly tells lies.I know that, but what do you suggest we do?Weve got to find Misty Mountain and build ourselves a log cabin there!Misty Mountain!?Sure, Misty Mountain.Ive never heard of it.Of course, you havent, you silly man. All you care about is bread and women.The man stopped playing the sitar and one large tear rolled down his cheek. He put the sitar back in the corner, took his long fur coat, and went out again. As soon as he opened the cabin door, a huge bear jumped upon him and he was gone in an instant. The bear entered the cabin and saw the picture on the wall. It was actually a framed poem. The bear came up close to the picture and stared at it for a long time, as though he could read or something. The poem went like this:We didnt know the value of graceBefore the world had lost its paceNow we all linger in solitudeCause weve made a terrifying mess.The bear crushed the framed poem and tore down the cabin. The snow was sparkling upon Misty Mountain. One could see millions of stars upon the land and, at nightfall, many more upon the crystal clear heavens....***After being crushed by the bear, Alex found himself in an unknown land. As if he was hovering above the valleys and mountains. Yes, he was certainly flying.Where am I? he thought and he could see his thoughts flying away from him. His thoughts were instantly taking the form of birds.Wow!And he saw another bird fly away from him.He wished to land somewhere and he recognised Misty Mountain below. As soon as the wish to land came to his mind, he found himself on the ground. It was springtime.... As he landed, he saw a cave and started walking towards it. He entered the cave and there he saw three men who were sitting upon large and colourful cushions. Some might think that they were all dazzling with light and that their faces were beaming with joy, but actually they were three ordinary-looking men engaged in a lively discussion. Right away he recognised Socrates, who was dressed as an old Athenian, but he could not recognise the other two men, who were wearing polo shirts and jeans. When they saw him, they smiled and waved to him to come closer.Welcome, dear friend! Weve been waiting for you.Alex smiled back and approached the three jolly men and sat with them. Magically, a fourth cushion appeared and he sat on it. He immediately realised that his cushion was not colourful, but a plain Indian yellow colour. Socrates, of course, read his mind and said:Remember when you were adamant to paint your family home in Indian yellow, even though your mother disagreed with the idea?Sure, I remember.So heres your Indian yellow. Enjoy it.***The Mystical Mountain, Kaf, or Misty Mountain, is the abode of the Simurgh, the king of all birds. Thats what Ive heard. The king, or some may think of it as a queen, isnt actually separate from us. Yet we have to search for him/her, and find the treasure which isnt buried beneath the pyramids, but within our own being.***May I ask you a question? Alex said to Socrates.Sure, my friend, replied Socrates with a broad smile.Have you seen Paul or Shanti anywhere around here?Do you have any particular reason why you wish to see them?Yes, I do.The other two men had been passively observing the conversation until then. At that point, one of them turned to Alex and he recognised him. It was Hari Prasad Chaurasia! And the other man wearing jeans was Ravi Shankar himself!We must tell you that we, too, enjoyed that concert in London very much. It was all magical, said Hari Prasad.Yes, those all-nighters are something to look for even here in these celestial realms, said Ravi.Youre not going to tell me that youll be playing here, too!? said Alex excitedly.And why not? If Socrates can bore us day in and day out with his arguments, we can play something for him now and then, Hari laughed.After these words, everyone was laughing aloud. When they settled down, Socrates said:Yes, sure, Ive seen them. In fact, I know where they live. Ill take you to their cabin any time."
Snow Day,"With snow falling at a rapid pace what is some of your best snow day stories from childhood, college and today? Now that I am old it is nice to relive the stories from the past and hear stories from others that make me feel young again:)One story I remember from my youth was going sledding to ""Death Hill"" (The rumors of by gone children dying on the hill and going to the hospital were legendary..... however no one knew any of the people personally or if they truly existed at all: )I remember the trek to the hill was like an adventure in itself. Starting from my house with a few friends and working our way through town. Passing the bank, the firehall and then crossing the major roadway to get to the town store then behind the store we trekked over hill and field to finally arrival (it seemed like hours) really 15 minutes or so. To the hill. The hill was steepish and ran down to bushes and a small stream the trick was not to end up in the stream or die hitting a bush or tree.We spent hours (seconds) peering over the edge to get the nerve to go. Once you did, down the hill you went hopefully bailing prior to said obstacles. It was fun and to my knowledge no one got hurt....badly. But to this day I still think of that hill on snow days. Have a great day all and enjoy the snow if possible.  was lucky growing up. My neighborhood had a great hill and 15 kids my age besides my brother and my cousins that lived next door. Snow days were awesome. Then in high school we used to get cheap beer and take ATVs in thru town to the woods and drink around a fire all day and cook mass amounts of venison in the coals. Now I build snowmen with my kids who are 4 and 2. Have you ever been nervous about something and wished for an excuse to avoid it? That's exactly what happens to the girl in I Need a Snow Day! Feeling nervous about her math test, she wishes for a snow day so she can miss school. When she wakes up in the morning, will there be lots of snow? Detailed illustrations and engaging text support emergent readers. This story can also be used to teach students to determine fact and opinion as well as to recognize and use exclamatory sentences. The world sleeps under a white blanket, unaware of the emotions I feel as I stare at the empty playground.A small wind blows by, causing the swings to sway and creak. Youre not here either, and I cant think of any more places you might be.As peaceful as the night is, the unforgiving chill of winter lingers. Where are you?Looking around, a shadow under the streetlight catches my eye.Walking towards it, a sigh of relief leaves my mouth as I run over, only to freeze at the sight of you.You wear a blank expression as you look up at me, your eyes colder than the air around us. All the words I was ready to blurt out die in my throat.Ive never seen you like this before.You make no move to leave, but your eyes never leave mine.I cant read them, but my heart seems to know what to do. Wordlessly, I sit down next to you, ignoring your empty gaze.Instead, I take in the falling snowflakes, sparkling in the light. Its like the stars in the sky have transformed, finding their way to illuminate the darkness despite the clouds.Finding their way to come down and touch us instead of shining from afar. Out of curiosity I stick out my tongue, hoping against most odds to catch one.You stifle a laugh at the sight of me, warmth returning to your eyes.I smile back sheepishly, knowing how silly I looked, being cross-eyed and all.Reaching out, I take your hand in mine before putting it back into my pocket, a move that even catches me by surprise.Still, the coldness of your hands is what shocks me more, followed by a slight ache in my heart. How long were you sitting here?The snow in your hair has gathered into a thick coating, another indication that youve been here for a while.We lock eyes again, and a small smile dances across my lips as I take in all of you.What?Is there something on my face? you ask, raising an eyebrow.My smile softens as I turn my whole body towards you.Yeah.Strength.Beauty. Bravery.Three words. Three truths.The last of your defenses fall at my words and your eyes well with tears.Its okay. Youve done well. My arms hold you close as you fall apart, clutching onto me as sobs wrack your body.The sound of your cries breaks my heart and I desperately fight back tears of my own. Tightening my hold on you, I swear to myself that Ill never leave you.Not for anything.I dont know how much time passes before your tears start to dry, the snow still falling from the sky.Cupping your face in my hands, I wipe away the snowflakes that kiss your cheeks before looking into your eyes.The heaviness of your soul has lightened, but the pain remains. Questions race through my mind, but I keep silent.Youll tell me if you want to, and only when youre ready. As much as I would fight the world to keep you safe, to avenge your hurt, I know its not my place.You are far more capable of fighting your own battles. What I can offer, though, is rest, love, and myself. And those are things Ill never hold back from you.Quietly I help you to your feet, my hand entwined in yours as a sign of comfort for you as well as a sign of reassurance for me.I found you, and Im not letting you go. Its only after I wrap you in blankets when you open your mouth, your voice hoarse but steady.Im sorry you had to see me like this.Tiredness is laced in your tone, but your words scream the opposite.Sitting down in front of you, I make sure your eyes are on mine before replying.Do not apologize for being human.Something clicks in your mind at those words, so I continue, praying youll understand how much I mean my words.In fact, thank you for trusting me enough to be vulnerable. Youre tearing up again, but you quickly blink them away and smile.Its a smile that catches me off guard, so gentle and filled with joy. Its a smile Ive seen before, a smile Ive always loved, because it lights up the room.And thank you, for being, your eyes dart back and forth as you try to come up with the right words.Your eyes light up before you pull me into a warm embrace, your head resting on my shoulder. Thank you for being my home.My heart swells with your words and I bury my head in your neck. Home. So this is what home is."
STUCK IN THE MIDDLE,"Richard, I hope youre not staying much longer. Margaret stood staring down at Richard, one hand on her hip, the other one tapping a pencil on his desk.  Richard fumed. Right now she was acting like Sister Rita and it was an instant flash back to my school life at Holy Bartholomy. Not a pretty picture, but I did my time and got out of there alive.Yes, maam and thank you. I answered to be kind and not an idiot. I plan to leave as soon as I finish adding the notes from the meeting to my work log. That was so not true since I waswrapped up playing the video game, MINECraft, and not doing anything work related.The weather is to take a turn for the worse in case you missed the memo. Margaret, aka Sister Rita, added a final sisterly comment. Are you aware, that everyone but you, left the building quite a while ago. A car pulled into the lot and the driver tapped the horn. Well, my ride is here, and you need to leave as well. I dont think I need to repeat the fact about the change in weather.Ten minutes and Im done. OK? He was awarded such a stern look that radiated down her long nose and stopped at her pursed lips. Richard wanted to just escort her to the door and shove her out but he couldnt let her get to him. She left without further fanfare.Wow, Richard was done with that woman for the day. I dont know how she gets to me. I guess there are some things you never forget. He thought back to one more moment in time. It was a minor lack of manners on his part and Sister Rita, in the heavy enunciation tone she used, wanted to make a point to the others. Loudly, told him to stand up and go into the corner in front of the classroom. Everyone laughed when he wet his pants. Silently, he cried. He shook that feeling away and put it back in his bad memory box.He went back to playing MINEcraft and hadnt realized a full hour had gone by before he looked out the window. Wow. I suppose I should think about getting out of here. The sky was darkening and the snow was coming down in a fury. He grabbed his coat, hat, notebook and gloves and attempted to push open the door. The snow was already piled high against it and now it was impossible to get out never mind attempting to get to his car. Heading down the mountain road from where the business was located, was not possible at this time, and would be an insane attempt on his part. Shaking his head and swearing a blue streak, he realized what a fool he was. Well, thats not gonna happen.  He put his stuff down and pulled out his cellphone to check the weather app. No service. Great. This is worse than I thought. He felt a little creeped out at a now empty and darkened building. He went around the foyer and turned on a few lights. As he did, he was met with hollow whistling sounds as the gusting wind picked up outside. The echo of creaking noises throughout added an occasional loud pop here and there. He panicked, grabbed his coat and picked a spot underneath his desk in an attempt to settle in for a while.  No one knew he was there. Only Sister Rita did and she made a point for him to leave which he did not follow up on.Richard was stuck. He wasnt familiar with the layout of the building as he was still the new kid on the job. The wind picked up and the lights flickered but thankfully stayed on  for now. After a while he began to nod off and laid down on his coat that he had bunched up to use as a pillow.Suddenly, a screeching sound startled him awake. He attempted to get up but could only raise himself on his elbows since he was still under the desk. The sound, it seemed, came from down the hallway. Nervously, he got up and crept over to the long corridor. The sound of a door closing in the distance made him go flat up against the wall, anxiously breathing in short bursts.  Another sound came from inside another room down the same hallway. It sounded like feet shuffling and then something hit the door. That room was the private office of the chief executive of the company who he rarely ever saw. The door was never left open. No one was allowed to access it for any reason. Richard quickly stepped back to his desk and frantically looked around until he found his only weapon of choice, a letter opener. He had to have this, just in case, for whatever reason he needed it. Discretely, he went down the hallway to that office to find the door surprisingly open ajar. Slowly, he pushed on it and looked in. A floor lamp was on. He opted to go in to see if anyone was there. Stepping quietly inside, holding onto the letter opener, he scanned the sparse area. There was a fancy ornate desk in the center of the room, a large mirror hung on one wall, a bookshelf with only one book was on another and the far wall had a huge portrait of a large oak tree. Odd.Richard took a moment to try to grasp what he walked into and to figure out what the heck was really going on .First - He was the last one in the building. He didnt get the memo, that it seemed everyone else did, concerning the incoming blizzard.Second - Now, he couldnt leave due to not paying attention to what was really going on outside.Third  He had a feeling that he was singled out and being led into something that was kind of weird.Maybe he was letting the noises and sounds play with his head. Somehow, this was beginning to feel like a SHINING moment.His eyes landed on an open memo pad on the desktop. He went over, picked it up and found an envelope clipped to it with his name on it. . He hesitated and looked around to see if someone was going to jump out of nowhere and scare the crap out of him. His first thought was to pack up and just get out of the building. He be dead before long before he made it out of the blizzard since he wasnt prepared for it at all. The wind suddenly died down and there was dead silence. Richard could only hear his heart racing. He held up the letter opener. Was it a coincidence that he had this? He opened the letter.Dear Richard, it began, You may be wondering at the interesting way we have purposely brought you here. Why you might ask? And the letter went on to describe the reason he was chosen. It seems that this was happening in other corporate offices around the world. It was a game CEO bigwigs were in on with one handpicked person from their staff to be the guinea pig on a quest to compete for the grand prize, as yet to be determined. They were each given a clue to begin the game, follow it through to each location, do what was asked along the way and succeed to the final ending.Richard was totally surprised and mystified as to this whole idea. This was crazy, but he had no choice. He was sort of locked in the building.Okay. What the heck. Its do or die I guess. He decided to take a chance, since there was no other option, but maybe he could make it fun.The letter, which he was instructed to keep with him at all times, told Richard to go to the large mirror. Find a reflection of what he saw over his shoulder. Glancing around he finally guessed that it was a faint flower pattern embossed in the wall. He was instructed to go and gently press on it. Immediately a secret door slid open. Following his curiosity, led him into a brick walled room. As soon as he entered, the door shut behind him and locked. He was startled by this serious motion. Each wall had a small box attached with a number on it. He needed the right answer to the question in order to open one of the boxes. The question was his prompt in the letter. It asked Richard to name the tune.  But, immediately a song filled the air. Richard smiled. He was so thankful that he was a fan of his buddies rock band of classic rock. He knew the song was by Queen. And sure enough, ANOTHER  BITES THE DUST was the answer as the #1 was on a box. He went over and pushed the button, but jumped back in alarm, as one brick wall crumbled down. Whoa! Now he was faced with stepping into another mystery room. The room was stark white and only had a door with a complicated lock.  He was instructed in the letter to tap the secret code on the door. That was the one and only way he could leave. The clue to the code was a picture of a birthday cake. Okay, now this seemed simple, but not simple. What did he need to know? He was forewarned that each clue and solution was time sensitive. He only had three minutes to figure this one out. In panic mode he moved about, slapped his head to think, stomped a foot and grew angry at his dilemma. He closed his eyes and began humming a tune. I GOT IT! He knocked the first part of the happy birthday tune on the door and to his surprise it opened! 20 seconds more and it would have been over.He let out a whoop and a holler at his success. The door closed and he was now in pitch black with not even a sliver of light to help see where he was. I guess Ill wait untilAnd then a trap door near his feet opened. Startled, he jumped back. There was weak lighting from the opening that dimly illuminated the area. He took the letter out. It said, Go down to the bottom.Richard panicked Suddenly it was if someone was nearby and unrolled a knotted climbing rope as it swung towards him. The way down now seemed doable with this method, as surprisingly enough, he has climbed many a cliff with his crew, just not down an abyss into the unknown. He pocketed the letter, and without hesitation, grabbed the rope, anchored his feet in a safe hold, and began the descent. Slowly, Richard scaled hand over hand until he had gone down at least two stories before reaching the bottom.He unraveled the rope, stood up and looked around. he mused. Richard had no clue why he was chosen, and if he was ahead of the others on this mystery trail in this so-called game. What was the outcome if any? He had no idea the time of day or if it was still a nightmare of a snowstorm out there. Suddenly, the low light, surrounding him, faded. It was met with a bright glowing light leading to an entry way that seemed to be the way out. He felt for the letter, and took it out to find that the next challenge was for him to follow the light. As he began to walk, a new light came on to guide him, the one behind faded and went out. This happened over and over leading him on. He understood that he had to keep going forward. The trail went a fair distance until he came to a crossroads. It seemed that there were three ways to choose. He needed to pick one. The letter was getting a bit frayed the more he pulled it in and out of his pockets. The question to this latest dilemma was, You must go North. If you dont, the game is over and you will not be able to leave until the end. That was not a wrong choice he needed. Richard had no idea, from the beginning of this mystery game, with all its twists and turns, into what direction he finally headed in getting to these crossroads. There had to be a clue, yet there were no clues left in the letter. He pondered his dilemma and looked at each exit. They were all created differently. To his left there was a set of railroad tracks that disappeared into the darkness. A banjo hung on the wall near the entrance. The second one, and straight ahead from where he stood was a huge pile of snow built into a snow castle. The right side had only one very large light globe attached to the wall. Underneath were several strands of small multicolored lights hanging across the wall. He had enough of the stress of all of this and sat down to contemplate the final answer when suddenly, each image timed out and blew away like dust as if they were only a mirage. Richard jumped up and became lost in the moment. Lights in each entryway starting blinking, Mardi Gras music began and confetti blew everywhere. This added so much confusion on purpose, no doubt. He fumbled for the letter to reread the clue. Go North. Richard started one way, swung around, came back, stopped and went back to the middle of the crossroads. Think! Dammit. He said to no one around. Okay, I got here and there were these images at each tunnel entrance. He hoped he was facing the same way he came in. Alright. The railroad tracks and that banjo were on the left. The music was confusing his thinking as it became louder. Lights appeared in crisscross patterns over where he stood. Another distraction. The right side had that really bright light globe and oh, yeah, those Christmas lights. Straight ahead he remembered a snow castle. Just then the music stopped, the lights went out and Richard felt his feet start to wobble. A part of the floor dislodged and a circular shape slowly rose with him on it. It began to move and Richard quickly got to his knees and held on. It slowly spun over and over, then stopped and lowered back down. Richard stood up a bit woozy.  He was confused and was just about to run down the nearest tunnel when the music came on. He paused and stood still.  His time was almost up This was not fun. He felt taken advantage of and had a flashback of his worst moments. Then a banjo began strumming a familiar tune, the next was John Denver brought to life singing one of his well-known songs, then the last musical stanzas reflected a classic adventure tale. Richard listened intently to it all. Now he got it. On the left he heard the banjo playing, Oh, Susanna, a railroad song in tune with the countrys westward expansion. WEST. The bright light and Christmas lights was a clue to the east with, Sunshine on My Shoulders with John Denver and was on his right. EAST. The epic and final song was North to Alaska and the words that he knew spelled the way out. Go North the Rush is on. Did he need to rush out? Well, that was the only clue needed and he quickly strode straight forward and due NORTH into the tunnel. He walked quickly and did not hesitate one second because, sure enough, a gate was activated and sealed the opening. Did he make the right choice?In the distance, Richard saw the faint image of a door. He hoped it was the way out and not another prank. He put his hand on the knob when it suddenly opened.The CEO of the company stood beaming, and a crowd of his co-workers stood cheering and clapping. The sky was clear and a helicopter awaited. Richard was so surprised, grinning like a little boy as he followed his boss inside the big bird. Well done, Richard! He was congratulated on his determination in winning the quest. As they took off into the sky, the CEO revealed to Richard his reward. Tap, tap, tap. He shook his head and sat up not realizing he nodded off at his desk. The sound was Margaret tapping her pencil on his desk. Wha-at? He was confused.  I came back in to get my purse. She smiled with her usual smug look. Im locking the door. Dont let anyone know youre here."
Words,"Once upon a time in a city of bailout a very weak baby was born her face was pale and pink and her hands were small then other normal newborn babies. She came out as young 9 months baby so nobody understands why that baby is so weak. Her mother named her Diana. When Diana turn 9 she always used to stay close her mother and anybody she used to meet told her she looks so weak like a little thing and she younger than her actual age and people often told her that she needs to take proper diet. Her mother did everything for her daughter to be healthy but she was still pale and weak people often laughed at her when she used to go take shoe shop looking at her small feet she might disappear one day. She started to become more introvert because every other person she used to meet told her how small her hands and her legs looked she was often bullied in her school and they named her mice, matchstick and many more. Instead of playing outside with her friends Diana used to enjoy playing with her toys ""hello Mr Tobby it looks like you spill the tea, again! But don't worry I won't judge you cause you're clumsy I like you Mr tobby cause you don't judge my from my apperance"" talking to her teddy bear Diana felt joy playing with her toys who never used to judge her. You know Mr tobby the schoolboys in my class told me today I might get kidnapped by someone cause I'm short and they always laughed at my apperance and I'm always so nice to them even though I hate them I wish I could tell them how I feel when they hurt me like that . After some years Diana grew up as a young beautiful girl but still looked weak and small. Her younger sister Este was born and was 12 years younger than Diana. People often told her mother that her younger daughter would look more older and mature than Diana. One day her aunt arrived Daina was happy to see and came forward to greet her but her aunt instantly told her ""oh Diana! you haven't changed yet, your face looked like ugly as a weak rat, looking at her with disgust in that moment Diana felt so hurt she couldn't even say anything and put her head down the whole time and she went in her room and could hear her aunt speaking to Diana's mother about her. Looking at her room's window a tear spilt down her cheek and moving forward and holding Mr to by she said 'it feels like people are constantly throwing stones at me and I don't even know why I'm in this place at the first place why can't just be normal Mr tobby? After somedays when her aunt left Dianas house she still kept on thinking about her words and refuse to look herself in the mirror for days"" why? God why? I'm like this it's like I want to tell People how badly they're words hurt me I want to hurt them like they had hurt me but every time I had so many things to tell them but I just can't I just cant. Why I'm so weak, why I don't have a courage to tell them at least just one time I want to speak for me. After being alone for some days Diana came out from her room and she said this is not the life I wanted for me her eyes were red and her hands and feet were shivering and it looks like every skin in her body told her that I had enough all these years she felt like a tree where people keep on cursing the tree till it finally became a dry lifeless one this is not the life I want she decided that she will never going to meet her relatives and her toxic friends who tolerated her instead of celebrating her. She grew up and atarted to work on herself and did actually what made her happy. After Some years went by When Diana turned 35 she had a beautiful skin dark black jet hair and her body turned healthy and beautiful she looked like she was in her young 20s. She came to her parents house for their anniversary where she met her ."" oh Diana ! you look so young nobody can make out that you're 35"" and when you were so young you used to be so ugly and now look at you turned into ugly duckling story. ""You see aunty meera I been always younger than my actual age there's nothing new about it .When you said I looked ugly as a mouse I cried for four weeks telling myself that why God made me this way and I wish I could have never existed I felt like people had to see my face and they had to tolerate it and they let me down so many years till I met my husband John who made me feel like how special I was and he told me it was love at first sight when he saw my face and my hands and felt like theyre so cute"" so you see it's all about perspective sone people they can never love you no matter how nice you are to them and some people always going to love you cause it's ""you"" and all these years i had a lot of things to say to you ,words that might hurt you too but I never utter those words i never said instead I took all the pain to myself cause I never wanted you to feel the way I felt and that taught me that I always had a good heart cause people don't remember which nail polish, or which brand attire you wore I'd day but they will always going to remember how you treated them that day thet place. So aunty the story of ugly duckling didn't teach you how ""an ugly duck turned into a beautiful one"" but it teaches you ""that the duck was always bautiful in the first place""."
A Lesson in Pink,"I see, Harshil, that youve found yourself in a bit of trouble again. His mother looked at him with a raised eyebrow, which had fascinated him as a toddler, but was now reserved for such dangerous occasions. His mother was quite disappointed in him. Her hands were on her hips, and her phone was in her hands - she had just received a phone call from his class teacher.	I  I did not know the bottle was going to hit him so hard, mother. Harshils tiny hands were folded and rested in front of him. He must have known he had not behaved like a good boy, because he looked like he was ready to bury himself in the ground rather than face the consequences for what he had done.	Do not tell me you do not have enough sense to realise hitting your friend with a bottle would have hurt him?	I did not know it would hurt him as much as it actually did. There was remorse in his mannerisms, which reassured his mother to some extent, but not entirely. She knew he would be telling her the truth. All of it. This was because there was only one thing she had ever taught her son - honesty.	When they had a kid, she decided with her husband that they were going to bring up Harshil by giving him as much independence and space as he would ever need. As a trade-off, whenever the two of them were going to engage with him in a conversation, he would need to be truthful.	And yes, as she looked down at her son on the verge of tears, she did realise he could not  be true once he grew up and interacted with a world which did not substitute integrity for success. But for now, he had to be this way in front of his mother. He had learned to be so for the eight years of his existence.	So, you did not know he was going to have a cut on his nose after you hit him?	I didnt know bottles could do that. Or that noses were so  loose. Once again, he was being genuine.	Why on earth would you hit him with a bottle in the first place?	He asked me what I thought about his new bottle.	The one you hit him with?	No, that one belonged to Krittika. It was lying on her desk and we were standing in front of it during the break.	Ah. So you told him what you thought about bottle?	Yes, I told him he looked like a girl while drinking from the bottle.	Harshils mother tilted her head to her left now, to complement her already raised eyebrow. Never before had she heard her son say something like this. What do you mean he looked like a girl drinking from the bottle?	It was a pink bottle.	The one he drank from?	Yes! Harshils face was less flattering now. His lips were curled up, and his eyes made clear an unspoken annoyance at this line of questioning. He could not understand why he was being asked about something he thought to be true.	Why would drinking from a pink bottle make a boy  a girl?	Thats what Rajeev - one of his closest friends - was telling me the other day.	And how would Rajeev know that?	His mother told him that. He wanted to buy a pink toy truck while they were out shopping. And his mother said,  She bought him a red toy truck instead. Mother, I want a toy truck too.	This divergence of focus annoyed his mother to some extent, but the concern about what he had learned at school outweighed her desire to remind him of the thousands of rupees his father had spent shopping new toys for him on his birthday just a few weeks ago. When you told him you thought he was a girl, what did he do?	He told me he thought  was a girl. And then he said I couldnt even pick up a bottle because Im so thin. Harshil indeed had a frail appearance, but it was not too unusual for kid of his age. It was just his body composition, and a characteristic which would cease to exist if he grew properly during his adolescence period in a few years time.	So, you hit him with the bottle? Right on the face?	Yes, to prove I    Im not a girl. Harshils voice was now breaking and his lips quivering. He struggled to speak. Tears started welling up in his eyes. A drop or two managed to make their way down his cheeks as well. I didnt mean to hit him so hard. But the bottle was full. And quite big. It slipped out of my hand. I thought I would just wave it in front of him, but it landed on his face.	So it slipped out of your hand and hit the boy, and gave him a cut on his nose, which he had to go to the infirmary for?	Yes. Finally, Harshil broke down crying.	At this point of time, his mother realised she had a problem on her hands. Microaggressions which ended up with schoolkids taking trips to the infirmary were a common part of growing up. But he had learned quite a troubling thing, and now, neither did he seem to be able to stop crying.	Thus came the need for her to bend down on her knees, look at Harshil - who continued to wipe away an endless stream of guilty tears - and hug him. She patted his head, wondering what to say now. She would need to strike a balance between telling him off while also showing how she still loved him. Along the way, she would need to teach him another principle she and her husband had decided to adopt - of teaching him the importance of paving a path for himself. A path which would be littered by other people with sexism, misogyny, and casual casteism along the way - all of which they would need to inform him was not as normal a part of life as others made them out to be.	After remaining in this one-sided embrace for some time, she withdrew herself, and looked at her son. His eyes were red from all the crying. Now that his hands had been freed up from being squeezed in between those of her own, he wiped away the residual tears once more. He had cried to his hearts content and could cry no more. Yet, the guilt remained in his eyes.	His mother tugged him along to the sofa set. She had refrained from letting him sit there up until this point in the conversation because she wanted him to face her, which a sofa would not allow. She also felt she was more intimidating when she stood and stared down at her son. Sitting down brought out the more comfortable side of her, which was not an appropriate mood to be in while scolding ones child. But now that she aimed to guide him, it would be the perfect setting for the two of them to shift to.	Why do you think pink is a girls colour? she asked.	Because  it is. Harshil still did not understand why his mother asked him these questions.	You  it is, but why?	Harshil tilted his head sideways. It was a habit he had adopted from his mother without realising it. Unlike her, he tended to employ it in situations where he was filled with wonder rather than frustration. When he could not come up with a response, however, he transformed to the latter emotion. His furrowed brows returned once more. I dont know why, he confessed.	Is it because your friend told you so?	His mother told him so too.	And where do you think it is that her mother got to know?	She is an adult. She must know whats right and whats wrong.	The mother now wondered for a moment what she should say. She could not imply adults did not have all the answers. At least, not yet, not explicitly. Rather, she put her point across in a more subtle manner - Do you remember that time your English teacher spoke incorrect English in the class?	Yes. She taught us how to use articles, then used them wrongly herself. She said hour, but the book said  hour. The parents had stirred up quite a controversy in the office of the principal the morning after this lesson had been delivered - their extremist approach within the office became a laughing stock in the community when the news of their conduct got out. Not in front of the children, though.	So you see, adults arent always correct.	But  but  The realisation dawned upon him now. So, adults arent always right?	Not always. Most of the time, yes, but not always.	Harshils tilted his head furthermore. For a few moments, it seemed he was on the verge of falling off the sofa and onto the carpeted floor. While he soon recovered his balance, the effects of his enlightenment were quite visible. Most notably, his eyes were now filled with curiosity again. The fear had subsided into the past, and was replaced by his awe at the things he kept discovering about this world.	So tell me now, Harshil, you said all of this happened because you didnt like being called a girl.	Yes. He sat upright. Again, he did not know he should feel remorseful for this attitude.	Did you do so because youre a boy, not a girl?	Yes, he said. I am , not . And with that, he himself had unearthed the issue which sat at the core of his thinking.	Like the gentle parent his mother was, she proceeded to peel through the layers which lurked above it. You think girls are weak?	Yes, they are. Us boys always run faster than them.	Being better than someone makes the other person weak, then?	Doesnt it?	His mother thought about this for a while. Krittikas a good friend of yours, isnt she? she asked.	Yes, she is.	Isnt she a topper?	Yes, she is.	So you dont do as well as her in studies.	I always come second though. He pouted as he said so. There was pride attached to his achievements. And with reason.	But still, she does better than you.	I guess she does.	Does that make you weak?	No! he protested. Im a very good student.	So, losing out to someone in one thing doesnt make the  you weak, then.	It doesnt. Harshils pout grew wearier. He was smart enough to realise his mothers point.	Youre a Marvel fan. Thats a fact, isnt it?	It is.	If someone calls you a DC fan, would you be insulted?	No, that would be silly.	Tell me then, is being a DC fan the worst thing in the world?	I dont think so  I like Batman a lot. Superman too.	But this other person thinks DC superheroes suck.	That persons  quite silly then.	Indeed. But what he said wouldnt hurt you personally, right?	No, I would just feel sorry for him. Daft in the head.	Tch, language!	Sorry, Harshil chuckled. On committing even the most minor offence, everyone in the household needed to make a deposit in the swear jar each time they ventured into the wrong side of the language they were speaking. Surprisingly, his mother let him off with a stern look this time around, not wanting to disturb the conversation they were having - and he felt quite happy about this.	So now, if someone calls you a girl because he thinks theyre weak, would be as hurt as you were?	No. Girls arent weak. Better at some things, worse at other things.	And girls arent bad at everything together, or good at everything together. Remember Rajnandini? She fails in studies every now and then, unlike Krittika.	She does. Harshil chuckled again. Rajnandini fancied him, and so did he. She was quite a sweet girl, which negated her academic leanings in his eyes. Her humour was more entertaining than drawing arrows which jumped around on the number line pointlessly all day, after all.	And then theres Sonam, who you say beats all the other boys at arm wrestling.	Shes so strong. She says she eats a lot of vegetables, and thats how she became so strong. I dont believe her.	Shes saying the truth.	Harshil stuck out his tongue in distaste. Even the prospect of beating Sonam at arm wrestling was not enough incentive to make him eat more vegetables than he was already forced to.	Over the course of this conversation, he had realised how silly was to believe in what most of his classmates did. When he went back to school the day after, he would try to explain to his friends the results of his own introspection. Girls werent weak, neither were boys strong. The world was more   than that. Complex was the word he was searching for - one he had learned in class just last week - but he failed to remember it in the heat of this moment.	Mother, I have a question of my own now.	Go ahead.	Arent most things like this?	Like what, son?	Most of the things we are taught by maam in class are just things she is telling us. How do we know she is right?	Well, as I said, adults are right most of the time.	But not  of the time.	I guess not.	What if someone is like our English teacher, and refuses to learn what is actually true?	She thinks what she knows the truth. Like you till today - you thought girls being weak is the truth. Now you know better - now you know girls can be just as strong as boys are.	Harshil nodded. He could ask the question which he really wanted to, then. Being honest means being truthful, isnt it?	Yes, it does.	You always say I must be honest with you.	And you always are.	But what if what I know isnt true, and I just dont know it yet?	His mother stared off into the distance, wondering once more what she should say. After some time, she brought up another example he would remember. Remember when we video called Raju  last Sunday?	Yes, he was in USA!	And he showed us the moon from his hotel window. Even though it was afternoon back here in Kolkata.	Yes.	But it wasnt in USA. What you saw out of your window was what you would see in India. What he saw out of his window is what he would see in the United States.	That makes sense.	Your truth and his truth were different then, wasnt it? He would say he knew for a fact that the Sun was sleeping and the moon was out, whereas you could see the Sun right in front of you!	Yes. It was a clear sky too. No clouds!	A beautiful afternoon indeed. Look outside. Even now, the Sun is sitting so peacefully in the middle of the sky.	Harshil got down from the sofa, and walked up to the window.	Dont look directly at the Sun, though.	No mother, I wont.	He stood there in silence for a few minutes, transfixed by the beauty of the scenery  one which would come across as mundane to even the most artistic of adults, but it could be painted over by the children with the pallets of their uncensored imaginations.	His mother continued to sit on the sofa behind him, looking at the sky too. She only broke away from her observance of this peaceful day when all of a sudden, Harshil turned around and asked her, If you always want me to be honest, mother, how would I know what the actual truth is?	She smiled. Whatever you can see for yourself is the truth, if your heart believes in it too.	And what if I realise my honesty has been about an untrue thing? Would I actually be a liar?No, my son. You wouldnt be a liar. If you realise your faults, you would just be wiser, then."
The day that brought change,"The day has arrived, and Hope cant seem to control herself. Today is the. Uh-oh first it seems like youll need an introduction. Hope Forbes is a little 9-year-old girl with cuteish smile, chocolate brown hair and pretty blue eyes. She is much more similar to her mother Candice Forbes. And she lives in Atlanta. So, lets pick up from where we left. Today is the day as Hope is going to visit and stay at her grandma and grandpas house for the rest of her vacations. As the corona virus pandemic was currently in action and there was lockdown all over her and her grandparents place, thus she was unable to visit them. And thats the reason shes over excited. Hope started packing her bag and was unknowingly packing her whole room items. At the same time her mother entered her room and exclaimed, Hope why are you packing the entire room in your little bag!! I suppose grandma and grandpa already have those essentials.Hope who was too busy packing suddenly realized the same and came to a halt. She told her mother with a sigh: my adrenaline is over all me, just cant control it. Sorry. Her mother laughed and said smiling its okay, but lets get a move on or we shall be late. They stuffed their luggage in the car and started their journey. Hope asked her mother when are we going to reach Covington? Mother replied just have a nap and we will soon be there. Her grandparents lived in a bungalow in Covington.~ AFTER MANY HOURS~Mother: Get up sweetie!!, we have reached our destination.Hope half sleepy opened her eyes and saw her grandparents. She squealed with delight and hugged them. After some time when everything was settled and adjusted, Hope started watching T.V. but as soon as she did that her mother Candice appeared and told her to do her classwork and project first. Upset hope went up upstairs and thought If for once she didnt listen to her mother and not do her project and classwork as there were still many vacay days ahead her. In the evening when she stepped downstairs for the dinner, her mother asked her about the classwork and the project and she lied back to her by saying she had completed it. Days passed, but her classwork and project were yet not finished. So, when her mother decided to check her classwork and project so far, she saw nothing except a completely blank notebook. She was shocked because she never lied except before the major incident of her life. She told grandmother about Hope and asked her to lead Hope to the right path. Grandmother wise and old thought of telling Hope a story about her mother Candice. Hope was excited to listen about her mother, so grandma began the story....Long ago, when your mother Candice Forbes was just as your age a life changing incident occurred. You see, your grandfather owned a cake shop business and he used to sell his cakes to his business partner Mr. Weasley so he could sell them in his supermarket. The business was adequate but Mr. Weasley was replaced by his son Tom. Candice had no clue of this. And so, she started boasting. She told Tom that your grandfather i.e., her father is going bake him the largest cake he had ever seen. when he is going to bake me the cake?? tom asked gleefully.By tomorrow Candice replied. And so, Candice came home, begged your grandpa to make an astonishing big cake but he straightforwardly said no. she pleaded and cried but unheeded. Finally, without an alternative she went to tom and was about to tell him when all of a sudden toms friends arrived and tom started telling them about the big cake. With a nagging pit in her stomach, she blurted out that the cake is not going to be baked because her fathers i.e., your grandpas admitted in a hospital due to hand facture. Tom totally horrified told her to take care of him and also told her that hell visit sometime later. Accordingly, she came home and told us that toms father was admitted to the hospital with a dangerous flu so as execute her lie perfectly. Perplexed both of us and Candice rushed to the hospital. Candice covered us completely in mask and PPE kits, and took us to the same room she told tom for the visit. She requested your grandpa to drink some liquor disguised as medicine so he could fall asleep. He fell to an instant sleep whereas I sat beside him on a chair totally confused. Hence, Candice went outside the room as to not be questioned about the medicine. After sometime Tom paid your grandpa a visit and consoled me. Puzzled I asked him about why was he consoling me and also told him that I should be the one comforting you. Tom bewildered was just about tell us what Candice had told him but on that very second your grandpa woke up sluggishly yet began listening with rapt attention. So, tom told us all about the conversations occurred with Candice and we told him about ours. The three of us sat in silence and came up with plan to teach Candice a lesson. Sometime later Candice entered the room and saw your grandpa with a hand and leg fracture and also saw me and tom crying and consoling respectively. She stared at me with a how did this happen look on her face. Unable to bear the sight of her father she exploded in tears and confessed to him about every single lie she ever said as well as pleaded for our forgiveness. We all aware of Candice learning her lesson started laughing. Bemused she asked me what was going on, ergo we all told her each and everything about our plan. Hence, she stated that never will I ever speak lie to anyone for the rest of my life. I promise. And from that day onwards your mother is incapable of telling even the smallest lie or half-truth. Thus, by saying this grandma concluded the story. Hope staring at her grandma with an easily readable expression bent her head down in shame, it seems you have lied to my dearie, just confess it and ask for forgiveness other than starting a lie chain grandma quoted. Hope upon realizing her mistake apologized to her mother as well as her grandparents and even completed her classwork and her project. She also swore to never ever speak lie again."
All For A Book,"Mavery Aston sighed weakly as the door pushed open. It had always been a New Years' Resolution, and yet, she hadn't finished it yet. Today though, she was going to skip the party and complete her book.Her husband, Adryan leant against the wall, staring at Mavery with raised eyebrows. ""Aren't you pushing yourself too much, dear?""Mavery glared at Adryan. ""No, no! I'm not! My goal was to publish a book. It was my resolution months ago! We're almost finished with a year, and I'm not done yet!"" she yelled, hysterically, her face, flushed, and scarlet-red with anger.She pressed her pen firmly onto the paper and scratched off a sentence. Maddening, she crumpled up the paper and tossed it in the wastepaper basket, missing it by inches. On the verge of tears, Mavery sunk into her bed, her hands clenching her fiery red hair.Adryan, tip-toed out of the room. ""Honey, maybe you should use a laptop or a typewriter,"" he added.Mavery sat up, frowning, and pushed the tortoise-shell glasses further up her nose. ""Yeah, maybe I should,"" she mumbled.Hastily, she flattened the squashed paper, and studied it for a moment, then pulled up the laptop, and started typing right away. The sound of clacking keys could be heard throughout the house, and anyone who knew Mavery well knew not to disturb her when she was in one of her ""hysterical, stressed out moods""Around eleven fifty-eight, her phone chimed. Mavery tried to backspace a spelling error and pick up her phone at the same time""Hey, Mave. Where are you?"" Lydia's voice was flushed, her tone filled with excitement.Mavery rolled her eyes, twisting her lips into a grim smile. ""I'm skipping it,"" she answered grumpily.""What? Why?"" Lydia was clearly stunned.""I need to work on my New Year Resolution.""""You mean for next year? There's still two more months Mave!""""I meant year,"" Mavery emphasized.""B-but, it's October!"" she stammered, shocked.""I know."" Mavery returned, defiantly.There was no answer. Then finally, ""Okay, I guess I'll see you tomorrow at the coffee shop then,"" Lydia mumbled.Mavery could make out distant giggling and laughter, the clinking of glasses and faint music. She swallowed and tried not to remember all the fun she would miss. She inhaled and then replied, ""I'm not going to be there tomorrow.""""Wait, what?""""I you, Lydia. I'm working on my book!""""Mavery, why can't you have some fun sometimes? It's just some coffee. Besides, I bet your book is almost done. You don't have to deprive yourself."" Lydia lectured.Mavery forced a smile. ""Sorry, but my decision stands,"" she responded with gritted teeth as she declined the call, and returned to the laptop, biting her lips.~~~""Hey, Mave. You still game for coffee?""Mavery clenched her hands and promised silently she wouldn't punch the phone. The offer sounded tempting, but she still had two more chapters, proofreading to do. She bit her lip and echoed into the phone, ""Fine, but just one cup. Promise?""Ten minutes later, the two of them were seated at the table, draped in warm scarves and woolly sweaters. They sipped coffee silently, Mavery punching some letters furiously away at her phone.""What you doing, Mave? I didn't ask for coffee just to have you doing your story over here."" Lydia groaned.Mavery put her phone down reluctantly.""Why are you so obsessed with this resolution anyways?"" Lydia asked curiously, gingerly wiping her coffee dribbled chin.Mavery stared absent-mindedly at her car. ""I don't know. Listen, I'll be right back.""Lydia stared at her as she walked towards the car, and brought out a notepad. Mavery beamed at her friend and clutched it up. ""Any ideas for my story?""Lydia gaped. She slammed her napkin down. ""Mavery, I don't even know why I asked you to get coffee with me. I should have asked Mia instead. You don't seem interested in me, or the coffee. You just want your story, that's all."" she glared angrily.Mavery sat on her chair, stunned. ""But, but - """"Do you even care about me? As your friend, I mean? 'Cos you don't seem interested in me. You know what? I think we'll be better off without knowing each other. So guess what? I'm leaving."" Lydia stormed off.Mavery returned awkward ""everything's fine"" smiles to gaping customers and gulped. She raised slowly and paid for her coffee before heading to her car miserably. Mave leaned in her car seat, her eyes closed. She punched a few numbers into her phone and put it to her ears, praying silently.A beep sounded at the end.""Hi! I'm not picking up right now, so please leave a message while you can."" Lydia's voice echoed into her ears.Mavery pressed a button and exhaled silently. ""Hi, Lydia. I'm terribly sorry, and I realize I made a mistake. Please forgive me. It was just a silly fight.""No answer.She pulled onto her driveway, slouching into her room, and starting on her book miserably, nibbling on a gingerbread cookie.As she typed away, two chapters remaining, became one, and then none.At around late evening, as sunset dawned onto her room, birds chirped, and fast food stalls packed up for the day. Her door pushed open gently and Adryan's face entered the room, concerned.Mavery's face was drooped onto her keyboard. ""Mavery. Mave, wake up.""She didn't move. Adryan glanced at her laptop and his eyes widened. ""She finished her book,"" he muttered, surprised.""Hey, Mave. Congrats on your book."" he smiled, patting her shoulder.""Mave?"" he asked, a little louder. ""Mave, ""Mavery didn't rise.He pulled her face over the laptop to get a closer look. Dark spots circled her eyes, and she was a pale-white. Her lips were crusted dry and her cheeks had drained in colour.""Somebody call 911!"" he yelled, his face paled in colour."

Over Under,"Charlie could not do it any longer. He carefully marked his place, sat his book down, and headed out of the room. He had been trying to read the same book for nearly six months. The noise had become far too distracting. Almost nothing would help anymore. They always came at the worst of times. He quickly checked his outfit in the mirror, and he went through the front door. As he was getting into his car, he noticed that he forgot to put on his tie. He considered going back inside to get it but decided he would rather not waste time on something as silly as a tie. He didnt think anyone really noticed it anyways. Charlie was a middle-aged balding man with thick round glasses and currently had a navy-blue suit on. He had bags under his eyes that suggested months if not years of restless nights and the distinct demeanor of an elderly man. People often assumed he was much older than he genuinely was.Charlie was on his way to work as the city's senior undertaker. It was his job to transport the recently deceased and perform the delicate procedure of getting them ready for burial, and he hated it. He hated everything about it. The morgue, with the cold empty atmosphere, the tight expensive suits he had to wear to all the funerals, and most of all the spirits that called to him wherever he was. He had first acquired this ability the day he turned 21. It had seemed like a blessing at first. Like he finally had a purpose in this world. He had liked to think of himself as a sort of afterlife therapist. Helping the recently deceased with whatever was keeping them back. His work had been full of wonder and adventure. He woke up feeling excited each and every day. What could be better than that? He also found out a lot of things he never knew before. For instance, one day he was working with a particularly difficult spirit in one of his sessions as he liked to call them, and the spirit just wasnt paying attention. Finally, he got so fed up that he grabbed him to shake some sense into him and the spirit just faded away never to be seen again. From this he found out that he could exert a sort of energy into the spirits and that was all it took. There was another time he attempted to bring one back to his house for another session. He had driven all the way back and had just gotten inside when he realized that the spirit had up and disappeared on him. It had taken him all day to retrace his steps. He had finally found it waiting patiently where he first discovered it. As it turned out, spirits could not move more than a block away from their bodies. Because of this it had started to become more and more difficult to get to them whenever they called. More often than not they were in some strangers house and he would have to come up with a ridiculous story to gain entry. So, in order to get better access, he took up the job of assistant undertaker. However, after a few years the novelty of his newfound ability wore off. He had become calloused and less deliberate. It had also become apparent that they did not care about him. Did not care that he might be sleeping, or eating, or who he might be with at the time. They did not thank him, and they were always miserable. He was now left stuck in this position. He did not want to do it anymore, but he feared that if he ever stopped the noise would multiply to a level that would leave him permanently deaf or insane or something. He had to accept the fact that this was life whether he liked it or not. Finally, there it was across the street. The house where he was sure all the noise was coming from. He got out of his car and approached the door. When he rang the doorbell, a small elderly plump man answered. His eyes were red, and his nose looked rubbed raw. Can I help you? he asked. Yes, I am the undertaker, here to collect the body. He looked a little puzzled. Oh, but we havent even called anybody about it yet. Darn it, he arrived too early. In his eagerness to get this over with he forgot to wait a while to let the proper people arrive first. He was about to come up with something clever when the man said, Well, you might as well come in anyway, Ill show you where she is. He followed him along the narrow passageway deeper into the house. He couldve found his way alright, but Charlie let him guide anyway. They finally made their way to a bedroom that looked like it had been converted to an at home hospice care facility. He was used to seeing this whenever he did house calls, so it no longer shocked him to see wires coming out of machines and regulators of different kinds filling the entire room. The room also housed a giant hospital bed. Finally, he caught sight of a faint apparition in a dark corner that, of course, only he could see and hear. The spirit appeared to be an elderly woman with a kind face. It was the kind of face that could only be made by a grandmother. One that filled you with memories of gingersnap cookies and chocolate milk.He quickly looked away pretending not to see it. Whenever the apparitions found out that he could see them they would immediately rush over and try to speak with him. He found this quite annoying most of the time. He usually waited until he got to the morgue or until he got in the hearse to finally acknowledge them. Mr. uh Charlie was mentally hitting himself. He forgot to ask his name. Timmons he finished. Right, Mr. Timmons. It might take me a while to prepare her for transport. Would you mind stepping out of the room for a moment. He looked a bit puzzled at this request but stepped out of the room anyway. Now that he was in the room alone, he started unplugging and unhooking the hospital machinery, surreptitiously glancing over to the corner where he knew the spirit was hovering. He started making notes on the notepad he kept with him. This was all for later record keeping. About half an hour later he was ready. He started rolling the bed out of the door. He looked back one more time to the dark corner before leaving, and unwittingly looked it right in the eyes. He quickly averted his eyes. Now he had done it. He hadnt even made it so much as out of the room. He braced himself, sure he was about to be bombarded with annoying questions, and pitiful moans, but nothing came. Had he only imagined it? No, he was convinced they had just locked eyes. As he left the room and turned the corner he chanced another look. Yes, there she was looking straight at him. Was she blind? No, this couldnt be right. He had met tons of ghosts who had bad eyesight in life, but they were perfectly lucid in death. He decided not to question it as he passed by the elderly man who let him in. He seemed to be engrossed in a serious conversation on the phone, so he decided to leave without speaking to him. He would talk with him at the funeral anyway. When he got to the curb, he folded up the hospital bed and put it into the hearse. Then he got inside and drove away. He had just reached the end of the street when he was startled by a voice that came from behind him. Now that we are out of the house, perhaps we should make a formal introduction. My name is Maggie Timmons, but everyone just calls me Granny Marge. He looked in his rearview mirror and noticed she had appeared from the back of the hearse and was sitting quite comfortably in the backseat. Thrown a little off guard he answered M-My name is Charlie Hoover. However, he quickly gathered himself and switched over to his elevator speech. And I bet you are wondering what is going on? he was about to continue when she astonished him by responding, no, not really. I had been seriously ill for some time. Although, I am confused, is this supposed to be heaven? Charlie turned a corner at a stop sign and said, No, it's still Earth, and you're a spirit living between this world and the next. She took a moment to process this for about a quarter of a mile and said, I see. Then she asked, so, why are you here? And why are you the only one who can see me? He had been dreading this question. He hated being reminded of this, but he put it out of his mind and took a moment to collect himself before saying, ""I can see you because it is my job to help souls like yours move on from your old lives. Anticipating her freaking out at being told his position would determine her entire eternity, he shrilled, but you dont have to worry. I am very good at what I do. I've been doing it a long long time. However, instead of freaking out, she said to him: Oh my, you poor thing, I should offer you some chocolate. I usually give my grandkids sweets when they are going through something rough, but alas they must be in my other souls pocket. This surprised him and he chuckled at this joke as they approached the ramp onto the highway. Forgive me for asking, but you seem to be taking this very well. Arent you terrified about leaving this world? She took another moment to answer and then said, My grandmother instilled in me that I should always be poised and calm in front of strangers. He waited for another answer, but none came. He made his way around a slow car and said, but we are not strangers anymore are we? I am Charlie Hoover and youre Granny Marge. He didnt know what was making him want to talk to her more. Usually he would just stick to the elevator speech, grab their hands, and watch them disappear. However, there was something intriguing about her. Like she genuinely cared more about him than herself. She laughed at this and remarked, yes I suppose were not strangers anymore are we. Well I cant lie to you I am scared. I am excited though that I will eventually get to where I must go, and I have complete confidence that you are able to do the job properly. She left the sentence hanging for a little while. But, there is still a part of me that remains afraid even though I know for certain where I am going. It is a different kind of fear. One I dont think I have ever experienced before. Silence hung at the end of that last sentence for what seemed like forever. They had gone another couple miles when Charlie broke the silence by saying, How do you know where you are going? I thought nobody really knew that. She looked at him from the mirror and said, I know because I have always known. There was a period when my own grandmother was dying. We siblings were called one by one to say our goodbyes. I was terrified of losing her, but she told me she was heading to a place where there was peace beyond peace. Where every tear was wiped away and all chaos ceased forever. I did not understand it at the time, and did not believe such a place existed. However, I feel I always knew it was there. It wasnt until I was close to death that I fully accepted it.He was left momentarily stunned at her certainty in this matter. A place where there was peace beyond peace? How could this be. He'd been doing this job for quite some time; he couldn't imagine his chaotic life ever being peaceful. Of course he had heard of this place before, but he had never heard it described quite like this. As they crossed the bridge into the downtown area, he reflected on this as the sun now bloomed over the horizon, bathing the city with a warm orange and yellow light. They did not speak again until they reached the tall building where Charlie worked. By then it was about 9:30 and the sun was fully in the sky Well here we are. Would you mind stepping out with me? She looked at him kindly and said, Of course Charlie. They both got out of the car. Now I need you to take my hands. She looked hesitant. Charlie said, Whats the matter? I thought you said you were ready. She didnt look at him, but instead was staring at her own hands, I am ready, but I was just thinking about all the people I was going to leave behind, and I just realized I never met my granddaughter's child. They were supposed to have a baby shower today, and I missed it. I missed it all. She looked like she would be on the verge of tears if it was possible to shed them as a ghost. Charlie was battling with himself at this moment. Just take her hands and be done with it, but he did not. Instead he found himself saying, What if I helped you see it. The child I mean. If she could shed tears now Charlie guessed her face would be covered in them. Oh that would be fantastic. Thank you! Thank you so much God bless you! He thought he must be going crazy, and he found his legs moving of their own accord back into the car. There was no turning back now. Her house is just across the street from mine. I dont know if we are going to make it. Charlie with a newfound surge of energy gunned it. It wasnt until 10 AM until they arrived back at the house. He parked a little ways down the street so that the man in the house where he picked Maggie up didnt notice him. He was across the street from where there was clearly a party going on in the unusually spacious front yard. He looked back at Maggie and said, you go on ahead. I dont want to draw attention to myself. But she did not seem to hear this, as she did not speak on her way out. She was drawn to the party across the street. He saw her glide into their midst and settled herself behind the young woman holding a bundle in her arms. Charlie watched as Maggies expression changed from worried to blissful as she looked at the swaddle of clothes that was a young baby. Then she looked back up, locked eyes with Charlie a smile creasing across her face, and disappeared. Well that was out of the way now he thought. He started his car and drove back to work. He worked at getting her body ready for burial that day without ceasing. He did not even take lunch. In fact when he was done he was very surprised to see that it was already time to go home. Maggie left him feeling different. It was a feeling he could not describe. He drove all the way home in silence trying desperately to pinpoint it. He got ready for bed; still not sure what it was that was different. He thought through everything that had happened that day. Then he thought about what Granny Marge had said about her grandmother. The peace that had come over her face as she talked about that place. The place of peace beyond peace. Where every tear was wiped away and every worry in the world ceased. He also thought about how genuinely kind she was, but also so real were her feelings. He laid down on his bed; somehow seeming lighter than he had before. Then he closed his eyes and had the best night sleep in years."
Creation,"There was a growing stillness in the world behind me around my head thickening and pulsing with life like an  pumping blood for the first time. Prepare to bear witness to fiery lakes prepare now for all which soon Ill create.This path will include a way to end death meant to learn early before my last breath.See child, I bestow this gift of life upon you at a great cost for everything must move in a circle.Ive been all through time from beginning to end and changed everything but it happens again.My life is the length of time for that is a lifetime and Ive vowed to change one thing only every revolution the Universe makes.	But what do you change Daddy?There used to be just one thing I wanted to change.See when I gave you the gift of life I also gave you the gift of death, a gift I pray for often for Ive spent an eternity watching my precious little Angel die a thousand deaths.	But I dont want you to die.Dont worry Angel I never will for I can only die if you gift it to me but I will never accept.I have to wait here for you to return from death for that is the way.Once upon a time I created a Universe of boringness.It had everything I could think of but still it just sat there.I didnt know what was a matter with it until you were born.You mattered so much to me that matter became matter and the Universe exploded into life.	I dont understand.What did I do?You turned me into a loving God and I realized it was a force more powerful than myself.I vowed to become the embodiment of love for my favorite little Angel and love you eternally so that you may live a thousand more lives.I knew when I first brought you to life that Id always love you my child.	I remember many times ago when the Universe was perfectly devout of life, devout of love, but still it was perfect.So perfect that I froze it in time satisfied with what I had created.Then I created you and the Universe spun around in the blink of an eye and you sure loved to spin around back then.As you grew older the Universe grew too and you wanted it to spin slower so you could watch all of the beautiful lights go by.	Whats my name Daddy?Well once upon a time we decided to watch all the Universe from beginning to end and choose a name for you when the Sun finally sets for the last time on life.Its always hard to see you grow up and go live your life but you tell me my favorite stories before Im left alone again with nothing but sleep. I did want to give you another gift today as well though.	Now I know everyone says this but my Dad gives the best gifts so I was really excited to find out about this so I asked him what he got me.	God held out his hands both holding forth a single seed.He said with one first This is my life I give unto you. and he shed a single tear of happiness so that I may grow and live.The beginning of life the beginning of time.Suddenly I felt motion inside me beginning to start the pulsing and pumping the beat of my heart.I could feel the build-up of blood lining up to the tracks like a royal guard still I dare not react.This gift my Dad gave me this gift he calls life Creation and Death are both paradise.	Then God held out his other hand and said This is the end this is my death and when you are ready Ill shed a single tear upon it and we shall die together.When the Sun sets on the last day of the Universe and we will learn your name together. 	With that on the first day Gods favorite little Angel took the seed of Creation and the seed of destruction and went off to live her life and tell God all of his favorite stories in doing so.This being the beginning of life and the beginning of motion so now time could have relevance.	On the second day she created time and space to have a place to write her stories for God and organize them.On the third day she ran into a bit of a problem she really struggled with although she didnt know what was the matter but she certainly had a theory.She let the matter build up until all that was a matter spilt out finally like a Big Bang of spectacular sounds and colors as they poured out in all the different directions.On the fourth day she made all the stars, planets, and other celestial bodies of the Universe from the very big to the very small.On the fifth day she made all of the creatures of the world to show God wondrous diversity for God loves all the creatures of the World.Finally on the sixth day she made man as a testament to God.She made man in Gods image because his favorite little Angel clearly worked so hard creating Adam God loved man more than he knew he could love anything except for his favorite little Angel of course.	She wore herself out with all her creating so decided to go down to Earth for a little while and enjoy her Creation for it reminded her so or her Daddy up in the heavens above.She lived beside Adam and walked hand in hand with him and did not think of her father for many years to come but all things must move in a circle and what begins must end.Her time spent on Earth too had to end and she knew what that meant though she was stalling for every precious last second of life.	God came down from the heavens above that night and sat down beside his favorite little Angel as they watched the last sunset to fall upon life one last time.Im ambitious by right and choose to be here to accept all my darkness and shed my last tear. Ive sat down and watched this sunset a thousand times before and changed only one thing in the Universe every day that passes us by in hopes that one day you will ask me to die.	What do you change Daddy?Ive tried to change everything but nothing has ever worked for Daddy.The only thing I change now is that I shed one more tear for having seen you die one more death.	God looked down at his favorite little Angel one last time before he shed his last tear but something was different.She held out her hand holding her other gift but this time it was her who shed a tear for the first time ever this day and this year.This time its real I pretended before patiently waiting with no reason to live Ive lost all that Ive loved Ive nothing to give.	Daddy she said as the Sun fell lower in the sky with the last lights from heaven floating on by.Im ready to go and finally leave and tell you my name has always been Eve.I dont want you to hurt I dont want you to cry this times the last this time well both die.	God was at a loss for words for hed lived a thousand lives and didnt remember anything new anymore but he said a prayer anyways.Blood take my mind away in your richness of passion wash my stress with doubt for confidence is my solvent. I lie here honest for I dare not move a finger in these trying times.Im certain I no longer possess the strength.Who am I? I ask for I am me yet not myself.Where am I?I have been here before but still I am lost.	Gods memories of good and bad with just moments of fleeting time to make new memories.For in his last breathe will be the last time anybody ever knows for sure that God ever existed and not even he knows what will happen next.God held his daughter one last time and for the first time ever God accepted the greatest gift ever given for he had always waited for his little Angel to ask him to die with her.I have waited for your gift of death for so long now that I believed that my love for you was eternal.God held his precious little Angel one last time and all was quiet all was still the fires lit and it takes deaths chill.My child my child hush down now and God looked in Eves eyes as he held her in that moment and froze time as a single tear locked onto his cheek.I might be God but I finally did something right for once.My precious little Angel made anything and everything in 6 days but it wasnt anywhere near perfect until we fell asleep together on the 7th day.Ive never seen anything so beautiful bless you bless you Angel of mine Ill hold you forever for longer than time. 	Dedicated to my Daughter:Alyssa"
Convincing Death,"I watch her sleep.And I watch her sleep some more.And she continues to sleep.Holy mackerel! Well, mackerels arent holy, but, wowzers! Is this girl gonna sleep all night? Hurry it up lady, you may be mortal, but its not like you need eight hours of sleep.Wait a second. I look it up, only to find that indeed, mortal humans need around eight hours of sleep.***So, four hours later, why is this girl still asleep?She stirs.Then she starts snoring again.Call me impatient, but I got other peeps to take, so clearly I need to assert my dominance.MARLEE! I bellow, HOW MUCH SLEEP DO YOU NEED?!?!Immediately, Marlee sits upright and swings her head around, searching for the face to match to the yelling. I try to introduce myself.Yo, Im-When she spots me, terrible sound comes out of her sleep encrusted mouth, interrupting me. Once Marlee finishes her screaming, she bounces out of her sleeping quarters and tears off my black cloak. She sees nothing underneath and screams some more.SHUSH, I say, not in the mood to waste anymore time.Are you death? Marlee asks.No, I say, Im an angel.She calms down, so I can continue, Im an angel of death.Marlee continues screaming, and then sobs at me, Im not ready to die, please dont take me!She says that shell give me anything, and I agree, just to make her stop crying. Gee whiz, its been a little over eight hours on the job, and Im already getting peeved. If all mortals are this dramatic about death, I think Ill transfer into the, good news of great joy, section.So what is it that you want for my life, sir? Marlee begins, I have, like, seven hundred dollars saved for university.Well, I suppose you wont need university if youre dead, I reply.But Im giving it to you so I die! Marlee cries.Oh, well, it wont stop you from dying, because where I come from, the streets are made of gold, so I dont need money.Marlee sighs, then scans the room for any other bribes she can offer me. Little (none) does she know that bribing an angel isnt very easy, nor will we accept any, even if the bribe was up to our standards. I check my watch. Actually, I dont mind staying overtime, Id like to see what this girl has to offer.I have this new autographed CD from Taylor Swift, Marlee offers, Shes really good, Ill play some for you.After listening to a few seconds, I shut off the CD player.When Marlee glares at me, I say, What? Id rather listen to Handels. And I can get as many of his autographs as I please.I chuckle as Marlee sits and twiddles her thumbs, thinking of something that would appease me. We go on like this for some minutes, until Marlees face brightens, and she bounces out of her bedroom door.I ask her where were going and she says that its a surprise. Still chuckling, I observe as she brings out bowls and eggs and other fancy things in containers from different cabinets in her kitchen. Marlee stirs and preheats and pours and sweats. After an hour or so, she comes up to me with some brown squares on a plate.Theyre brownies, Marlee explains, These are a crowd favorite, passed down from generations! If these dont convince you to let me stay, noth- She stops.Good idea, I respond, Dont let your life ride on browns.Brownies, corrects Marlee.I smile at her and pick up the offering. Its soft and brown.Uhm, Marlee, I begin. She looks defeated already. What exactly do I  do? With this?Groaning, Marlee answers, Youre supposed to eat it. Like, to consume and digest?I giggle a bit, Youve taken off my cloak before. I dont really have a body, or at least not one like a humans. I cant digest anything.Before I even finish speaking, Marlee already looks like she has another idea, and is skipping back up to her room. She says that she is willing to give up her prized possession, the most important thing she has  had the privilege of owning.Marlee thrusts a huge poster at me, and holds it open so that I can behold its majestic contents. She grins proudly, arousing curiosity in me, and I begin to get a bit excited as I roll it open.Its a signed picture of Shawn Mendes. ! Signed by! Marlees voice seems to become higher pitched and less abled as she continues.I look at her, expecting a bit better, a little more. After all, it is her prized possession.What am I supposed to do with this pale, scrawny boy? Fight demons? I say, gravely disappointed when I realize that this is it, Its not even like its the actual person. And whats wrong with his stomach Whats with all the blocks on his tummy? I suddenly feel guilty, Oh my, is he starving? Poor, poor boy! Ill have to help-Hes not starving! Marlees eyes flash with rage, then awe. Hes sexy. And those are his abs. They make him look so powerful and-Powerful?! I guffaw. You know, after standing in the presence of God for a second, your definition of power kinda improves. Besides, Shawn Mendings hands arent any more amazing than your ha-! Shawn ! Marlee seems to really like this boy, Why do you have to be such a one-upper! I dont wanna die, Im only fourteen!I stare at her for a few reasons. Did she not hear anything I said besides the guys name? Did she say that she was fourteen? I was told that the Marlee Im taking is 94. I was really wondering why a 94 year old was still a girl, but I dont have much experience with people.I clear my throat. Fourteen, you say? I ask Marlee. Youre not Marlee Johnhopper of Green street?No, Marlee answers, Thats our neighbor. Im Marlee Hognjopper. My parents are visiting her right now. So Im not dying today?!I nod at her, and she screams about how happy she is that she gets to keep her Shawn Mendes picture, and how she gets to see her friends at school again.Floating out the door, I sigh, hoping the older Marlee isnt as bent on screaming as her neighbor."

With arroganceshe continued "" Azi, you should feed them with food and water. Clean the cage when needed. It should feel proud that it's sharing it's shelter in one of the best master in surat"" . The instructions dragged on. At last the family took leave of him. Home was left with he and his grandfather.The night passed on with no great shakes. Morning vibe was escorted with copious emotions. Hot coffee was ready in the table. Elated ,he strolled towards the air filled with coffee. His delight got muddled with creepy noise of his new resident.He gave a sharp look at it. He intends to flew it away so that he becomes free from his work and creepy sound.Baba barged in to his thoughts. "" Azi, I got fed up with it's noise. I was not able to take even a nap last night"". Baba's statement was self proven with his sluggish face.  ""Breakfast ho chuka hai"" maid aunty was screaming. "" Azi , let's have breakfast son"".He accompanied his  leaving back the ' flyingissue' .Both of them got confined in the bird's cage. Azad with all perplexity, somehow managed to clean the cage and feed it.After the tiring day he got into bed soon. His fatigue made him unaware of baba's shriek. Suddenly he got awakened in baba's high pitch. Azad hurried down. Thefrieky sound in the background while he was stepping down madehim conscious about theaffair."" Kya hua baba"" he asked. "" Beta, this sound is probing through ears. I can't sleep son.""Azad was thoughtless. The only solution for the present situation is to take baba with him upstairs. He took him  upstairs. It took nearly an hour for himto climb the stairs.Next day began with the heated discussion about the bird. Both grandfather and grandson got fed up with the bird. Azad can no more take care of it or feed it..baba has become annoyed with it's blabber.The question araisedas to how to get rid of the creature. But ammi's wrathful came into theirpicture.Azad felt in the same condition as in the mathematics exam. Solution should be in favour of his irritating teacher. The only one left in the home to ask the opinion was the maid aunty,Sreedevi. As name goes she is a soul of kindness and love.Both didn't wait a minute to call her. She joined the problem solving task. She made Azad aware of importance of cleanliness , quality of kindnes, so on. But he was not convinced. He thought "" how can someone waste energy and time for something which is not his own or from which he doesn't have any benefit."" He saw maid hurrying to kitchen . It was time for baba's bath.""Sreedevi, you didn't solve my query yet"" baba complained. "" Are baba , Iwas about to tell that only. "" She was more concerned about his bath. Thinking for a while she continued "" may be it will have some reasons for making noise"". Giving least botheration for her statement she continued with her job. Azad fell into a deep thought of her solution. "" What obstacle will a bird have?"" Having diffused with the same thought he observedthe lady who was taking care of his baba. Sreedevi always assured his cleanliness. With an amiable face she carefully soaked the towel and scrubbed over him.Azad felt so guilty. "" Baba is a very unknown person for her. But his inefficiency for taking care of himself have created a vibe of kindness rather than hatred. So why can't I have that act to a mute creature"" Azad thought.He felt he tracked down the solution for his trouble. But baba's issue was yet to be solved.That night he got baba upstairs due to the prevailing trouble. Azad was unable to sleep thinking about the flying creature. He went downstairs to take a look at it.The noise was piercing as heneared the cage. He inspected the cage and surrounding. He was not able to find any amiss. Suddenly he foundtwo shining eyes of cats near the cage. He screamed at it and shining eyes faded inthe darkness. Green beauty ceased theuncanny noise. Azad stared at the pitiful soul for a while. Heremembered about his maid aunty mentioning about some trouble faced by it as remedy for baba's query.Before he went to bed ,he secured the beauty inside home.Next morning he explained everything to his baba. His baba became glad listening to the last day's events. As the talk was going on maid entered with a joyful smile. Baba and Azad gave a blissful smile backand to each other. After all Sreedevi was the passionate figure behind the resolution.Next day ammi and abba returned from Delhi. Azad and baba welcomed them with joy. Ammi was delighted to see her present, the bird."" Baba , it seems like our guest has not created any trouble to you"" She told proudly. Baba gave apleasant smile to Azad. He smiled back."
Move On: Rock bottom,"Ever reached rock bottom? No, not that fantasy world with the talking fishes and tasty burgers. It's a mental place. And when you get there, your brain automatically tells you to leave. Get out. Move on. But it's never easy.Some of us didn't exactly stick the landing and we're broken pieces scattered around.Maybe we pick ourselves together, maybe we don't. Maybe we're too tired, tired of it all, tired from the drop, tired of being broken, tired of being put back together, tired of falling after getting back up, or like I said before just tired of it all. So we traipse all broken. Not like a lone soldier ant driven with purpose, marching towards a goal. We can't go that fast, we can but we don't, we're tired, and our purpose is broken too, just like us.You brain always tells you to get up, leave, move on. Maybe you hear, maybe slowly you stop hearing it. Maybe you say, 'later'; you know it's a lie. Maybe you pick up a rock you like, the gray igneous mineral. You call it 'mata'. Maybe you call 'mata', friend; maybe so you don't feel lonely in this vast empty plane. So you wander together leisurely and the emptyness becomes home, till slowly you can't hear calls from your real home. You're at peace here now.Some of us on the other hand, never stay there too long. Like a rubber ball we hit the surface (rock bottom), 'hey' we say. Our brain also says leave, move on. With the same intensity as we plummet, we propel ourselves off the wall, 'Bye' we say, leaving the vast empty lands fairly scarred.Really, wherever you are on the spectrum, either at the far ends or in the middle; maybe you're there a while or maybe you've been there a long time. You need help or maybe you don't. But to those who do need help,  you need Heux or well creatures like Heux.The fire place gives the only illumination to the living room. By now, he knew that whenever the fireplace is lit his roommate, Doko, is home and by this time Doko is probably asleep on the Bridgewater couch. Doko always kept the White leather couch before the fire place. He says the fire helps calm his nerves and helps put him to sleep. Get in, get the stuff, and get out, before he realises.""What are you up to so early, Heux?"" The sound comes from underneath the blanket. Heux can see the creature turn underneath the blanket from where he's planted few metres away from the door. So much for going unnoticed.""I got a job to do."" Heux says still standing in place, sighs and continues with his hunt.The creature sits up. The light from the fireplace accentuates the glory of his messy blonde hair. He looks behind the couch, sleepy eyes observing the muscular figure. ""It's New year,"" he sighs.""I have an early client. Boss wants the job done fast...he doesn't have much time.""""Ohhhh,"" he mouths before resting his head back on the arm of the couch. ""Who is it this time?""""I don't know, some Ex military or something. I haven't even looked at the file. I'm not his first, so probably another lost case.""""You know they only call you in for the tough ones.""""What about you?""""I don't think I'll get called in till February.""""Right. Shouldn't you start packing too, you know how time flies here.""""I'm already packed, all I need is me."" The creature stood tall, chest puffed and letting his friend bask in his glory. ""Unlike you. All I need to do is get in, deliver the message and I'm out. It's a shame, you won't be around. Arain is having this get together andI know you don't fancy things like this. But at least, Beix would be there, maybe I can get you to go then, probably not. But we need a break too, you most of all.""""Hmmm,"" Heux says picking up his bag.""You'll probably won't be around for the March Carvinal.""""Doko you better than anyone should know how this cases go.""""Another human year and you won't still be around."" Doko said, ""I have an idea why not just say, no. When Big boss calls you to give you another case, say no.""""Why don't you try saying that to Xrya sometime.""Xrya isn't exactly the most approachable creature you'll meet. Leading district A messengers, work is paramount and perfection is expected from colleagues. But Xrya just like every other creature here knows nothing but good and love.""Noooo. You know what happened to the last one who did that""Doko shudders""But you and Big boss have a different relationship. I mean Big boss calls you up personally, personally my friend...You think Big boss knows? I mean he knows everything.""""Maybe.""""But he hasn't said anything. I have an idea, don't do a perfect job, take the lazy route""Heux crosses his hands. "" You're talking like them."" I'm just thinking that maybe if you didn't do such a good job, maybe...well, that was stupid.""""I'm glad you know it."" Heux says, ""Hey, relax. It's not that bad. I love helping them, it's why we're created... I just want to help another way.""Doko sighs and sits on the floor. ""I love them too...""""Well I'm gone, don't burn the house down,"" Heux says disappearing into a puff of white smoke.***The little boy runs right through Heux towards the farm house.""Be careful, Aiden,"" his mother calls from behind him.""Grand pa,""says the boy as he hugs the startled old man.""Grandpa, I've missed you so much. Did you get my letters? I never got any back, so I didn't know if you got them. Mom tells me old people are very busy. So if you got them and didn't reply, I understand. I got you a present""""What...why are you""""Honey, why don't you go unpack. You remember where, don't you?"" the plump blonde hands him a blue duffel bag.""Yes, mum,"" he says running into the house.""It's nice to see you Bob. I'm glad to see you're looking well.""Bob ignores the woman at the door and settles into the old wooden rocking chair by the living room window. Bob's wife, Gabriella, used to knit in that same chair. Gabriella didn't know how to knit, but she did so anyways. She'd sit down, singing along with Louis Armstrong and the song ""What a wonderful world"" playing in the DVD player.The sturdy man stood perplexed, a stranger can tell Bob and him are related. They both had the same ultrafine coffee brown hair, flat nose and the weird way folds form between their eyebrows when they're mad like he is at the moment. He drops the luggages on the pile of newspapers and socks. ""This place is a mess. Dad, why don't you let Martha in to help with the cleaning?""This wasn't the first time they had this argument and it wasn't the first time they've had to change the cleaning lady.""You want me to let a spy intomy house.""""Martha isn't a spy. She's""""Why are you here?"" Bob asks.""Please excuse us, Michelle.""This wasn't the first time Michelle had to excuse them for . And usually at this point she'll make her way to the kitchen to make tea. But not today. She looks towards the kitchen and concludes she's too tired to rumage the kitchen to find the teapot. And she forgot to bring her special lavender and mint tea, she decides to keep Aiden's company to ensure he doesn't mistakenly overhear ""We came to visit Dad.""""Why?""""It's New year. We couldn't make it for Christmas. But then..."""" I told you not to come.I just want to be ALONE.""""It would be a great family time.""""You do this every year, Charlie. And every year I tell you NOT TO COME BACK.""""Aiden is going to hear you. You know how much this means to him,"" Charlie whispers.""How long?""""How long what?""Bob asks, ""How long are you going to be here?""""We planned on staying the week.""""Not in my house.""Charlie begs. ""Three days.""""Leave by tomorrow.""""You know actually I'd given up, but Aidenhe's still persistent. What am I supposed to say when he askes me if we're going over to Grandpa's house.""There's an extremely long silence. Bob does his famous act, ""Closing his eyes, he rocks back and forth. He's not exactly actor of the year, as he grumbles under his breathe.""I don't mean to intrude. I'll do as you say.""""Great."" Bob says.""Is this how it always is?"" Heux asks the creature behind Bob, Reki, his guardian.Reki sighs. ""Don't even ask.""Michelle and Adrien walk down the stairs.Charlie stops Michelle. ""I think we should clean up before we start any unpacking.""Aiden sprints to the rocking chair. ""Grand pa. Can we go fishing today?""Bob breaks his act again and opens one eye. His eight year grandson is kneeling. His almond eyes are filled with so much hope. Hope that Bob doesn't have, at least not any longer. Hope that reminds him of Gabriella. He closed both eyes back. ""No.""""But we haven't gone fishing in a long time""""I'm busy today.""Michelle calls from behind him. ""Honey. There's so much cleaning to do. You can't go fishing today.""""What about tomorrow, Grand pa?"""" I'll be busy tomorrow.""""But...Okay. I understand...Old people are busy,"" Adrien says standing up.""Can you help pick up trash around the house?"" Michelle asks.""Okay,"" he says and runs upstairs.Michelle touches Charlie's shoulder and smiles, he knows it means, and she jogs up the stairs.Charlie walks to the rocking chair. ""Not only are you pushing us away, you're pushing Aiden away too. Pushing us away isn't going to help things. All Aiden wants is for you to be happy.""Do you remember when you'd promised you'll take him fishing when you get back from Afghanistan. Do you know that because you told him to only reach you through letters? He writes to you all the time. I mean how many kids his age sends letters. What's worse is you've never replied, not even once.""He asked me, '' I don't know what to do dad. You're not letting me help. You're not letting anyone, not us, not your therapist, noone. This is just one of those times you can't help yourself. It's been three years, it's time to move on.""Bob continues with his act, only this time he's convincing.""I miss her,"" Charlie whispers. ""I miss her too.""The Pines do as much cleaning as they can before setting off the next afternoon. Bob continues his act while they pack up, get in the car and leave. He continues till it was no longer an act. He wakes up in the evening, looks around the empty apartment. He rereads Adrien letters and goes back to sleep.Nine weeks later...In an apartment in Chicago, The Brunt sit around their glass dinning table.""Do you want another meatball, Aiden?""""Yes, please."" Aiden says, ""I wonder what Grand pa is having for dinner. Mom you know he really loves meatballs. """"I do. Don't worry, when next we visit we'll make him some.""Adrien nods as his fork breaks into the meatball. Charlie's phone rings and he excuses himself from the table. A plopping noise from the kitchen causes Michelle to leave the dinning.""I'll be right back. Just keep eating,"" she says.Charlie is by the kitchen sink.""What happened?"" Michelle asks.""I got a call from the hospital. It's dad """"I'm so sorry Charlie."" She heads for the door. ""I'll go pack our things.""""No, you should stay here with Aiden. You know how tough my dad can be."""" I don't mind. Plus school has been closed down, Aiden can come with us. I'm sure he'll be elated. """"Okay. We'll leave first thing tomorrow morning.""""I'll start packing.""""Step one: get them to come back. Done,"" Heux says.They say we don't realise what we have till it's gone. Maybe their right. Sometimes the fear of losing what we have makes us fight harder. They're out of the door by six in the morning.""Step two: pass the information."" Heux says sitting beside Adrien in the leather seat.""Why are there so many pop ups on my phone?"" Michelle swipes irritatedly across the screen of her phone with her finger.""Try to disable it in your settings,"" Charlie says changing lanes.""I don't think that's it.""""What's it on?""""Covid 19London has declared lockdownPanic buyingand the likes.""Michelle puts on her glasses and reads each pop up article. Few minutes pass and she asks, ""Can we quickly stop at Costco?""""Why?""""This articles says a lot of countries have declared lockdown. They advised citizens to stock up as to restrict movement. I just think since we're visiting Bob we should help stock up his place. You know if there's a lockdown, it won't be convenient for him. He's all by himself. And it says it's more fatal in old people. """"But why stop here? We'll just buy something from another store over there."""" Yes but Charlie it's Costco. There's no Costco there. I'm buying bulk and I'll get good deals here. I know you're rushing to see Bob, but you already called this morning. He's stable. It wouldn't hurt. I'll be quick.""Charlie pulls up in Costco's parking lot. Michelle had highlighted from the car earlier. Aiden had fallen asleep.Heux looks out the window. ""Step three: get them to stock up. Done.""The Toyota Tacoma drives up the front porch of the familiar farm house.""Dad!"" Charlie screams, searching the house.""What is it? Why are you shouting?"" The sound coming from the back of the house.He gets to the field to see Bob sitting on the bench and feeding chickens. Bob had sold all the farm animals after Gabrielle passed but he couldn't bring himself to sell the chickens. They were her favourite. She didn't even let him eat their eggs. Sometimes he forgets about them until they wander towards the house. Other times, when he feels alone without Gabrielle, he comes to them first. Probably, this surprises the chickens or they've been surprised too many times and now they can only pity Bob.""You scared me. We went to the hospital but they said you already came back home. Why did you leave? You""Bob staggers up from the seat. ""I'm fine Charlie. I'm a grown ass man. You didn't have to drive all the way here""Charlie hugs Bob. ""You passed out. I was so scared. I don't know what I'll do if something happened... I kept blaming myself for how the last visit ended...""""Okay now. You can let go.""Michelle walks in with a sleeping Aiden in her hands. ""Hey, Bob, "" she whispers. Aiden twists in his sleep. Michelle draws a corral in the air with her index finger of her free hand, indicating she'll be back, before walking out.""Yyou brought the whole family?""Aiden scratches his elbow. ""Yes. It was the spur of the moment.""""Be nice. Be nice. You almost died."" Bob murmures.""What was that?""""Nothing.""""We thought it was something serious, the way the receptionist described it...""Bob laughs. "" Tammy tends to overexaggerate  Just your luck.""""Not luck,"" Heux inputs.""I was almost scared to death.""Bob asks, ""Now that you know I'm fine. When will you be leaving?""""Tomorrow. We'll be out of your gun by tomorrow.""Michelle walks back in with two cups of tea. She wasn't going to forget her tea this time. The smell of lavender hits their noses, with a little tingling from the mint. Bob had said tea like this were meant for scenting not drinking.""I'll go offload."" Charlie leaves.""You gave us a scare there,"" Michelle says handing Bob a cup.""I'm still my old rugged self.""""That's about to change,"" Heux saysCharles stammers. ""Michelle... I was too anxious before to notice, butwhat did you buy?""""Trust me, their essentials. I got everything the article said I will need.""""Everything?"" Charlie asks. He's voice getting a few octaves lower.Michelle suddenly has an interest in the tea. She takes a sip, grins uncomfortably and lets her smile dissolve with another sip. Michelle is so interested in the tea that she doesn't see him storm off.""What are they for?"" Bob asks.""It will make things easier for you in case there's a lockdown.""The next day Heux sits on the bonnet of the black vehicle. He watches as they say their goodbyes, get in the back and Charlie's failed attempt at starting the car. ""Step four: Don't let them leave,"" he says.He watches as they crawl back into the house. He smirks at Bob's disappointing face. After a whole day of Bob and Charlie trying to fix the vehicle themselves, they give up. It was a good bonding moment for both men, not that they realised it. They argued over spare parts. Made jokes on engine fuel. If anything they talked and it wasn't akward and tensed like it used to be. Eventually, they give up and settle on calling the Mechanic, Carl.Carl comes over the next day. He starts the ignition and it starts.Charlie whistled. ""Hey. We actually fixed it.""Bob laughs. ""I told you it only needed to rest the night.""They send the mechanic on his way. They eat lunch and get back in the car. Only it doesn't start again.Michelle sighs. ""What did you do?""Bob walks up to the drivers window with a frustrated face. ""Ya. What did you do, Charlie.""""I didn't do anything.""""Well, you must have.""""Oh brother. Aiden let's go back in honey. Let's leave your father to think about his life choices,"" Michelle says.Later that evening, as they watch the evening news; little did they know that life as they knew it is about to change.Michelle watches the evening news, while the boys tried desperately to prepare dinner. Bob says he wants to show Aiden the right way to cook fish and Michelle needs any reason to not cook.""The city of Chicago is imposing a Lockdown. All social activities are to be suspended. This is a stay at home orders. Now to our correspondent"" the blonde newscaster reads.""Honey, did you get a call from work."" Michelle shouts.Charlie shouts back from the kitchen. ""No. why?""""You need to see this,"" Michelle says. ""Luckily, I stocked up.""""You're welcome."" Heux says, ""Now this is the hard part. Step five: Help Bob move on and that will be easier if his family are around.""Reki says, ""Well, you've certainly come a long way.""Days pass and the car doesn't still start. Charlie gets a text from work asking him to walk from home. He is about to walk the year in Michelle's shoes, who is work at home Blogger. Theydecide on going back home with public transport. But to everyone's surprise Bob stops them.""You can stay till this thing blows over. Your car breaking down is a sign. I've learnt from my years on the field that you shouldn't blow things like this off. Plus, I don't want to you exposing my grandson to any risks. I heard on the radio that it's more deadly in children and Aiden is asthmatic...Gabrielle won't forgive me if anything happened to any of you, because of me. Sostay."" Bob says his lines before continuing with his signature act, leaving Charlie and Michelle dumbfounded.Four month has passed. The brunt family is playing Charade on this warm evening. Laughter in the air, face masks covered faces, hand sanitizers and disinfectants with the pile of game boards. Aiden and Bob are in one team, they were surprisingly leading even though it's only by a little margin, while Charlie and Michelle were in another.Gradually, Bob is becoming a stranger to the empty plains and slowly he is embracing Reki says, ""There were right about you, Heux. You're actually great at this.""""I did nothing. They did it. All I did was give ""***Heux gets back home. Doko, probably out on a job, is luckily no where to be found. Heux takes the quick alone time to make the move. He brings out the letter and rereads it for the thousandth time. The writing seems unfamiliar each time he reads it. Each time he'd convince himself that it wasn't time yet. Or he didn't say something quite right. And each time he'd keep it back in the cabinet.Sometimes even the strongest people need help too, they need  To let go. It's never easy to move on.Doko isn't there but Heux hears the creatures voice ""Just do it, Heux.""The ball is rolling. It's time to leave the emptiness, say goodbye to 'mata' and Embrace the new."
"So what time do you think this is, young man?","So what time do you think this is young man?I strongly believe that it is one oclock, old man. Thats what the clock on the wall tells me, although it doesnt speak out loud. And I have found it to be pretty reliable in the past, so I will trust it now.So you come home late, and your mouth is filled with sarcasm, eh boy.No, I left a lot of my sarcasm at the party, old man.I didnt know that I would be needing so much when I got home.Otherwise I would have kept quiet when I was there.I think that you have an inexhaustible supply, young man, an inexhaustible supply.So, I wonder where I learned my sarcasm from, old man.Somebody must have taught me well, dont you think?Okay, enough of that.So what did you and your friends do at this party that made you come home so late, way past your curfew?You know that question gives me a great opportunity for more sarcasm, but I am going to stop that right now.I am going to speak to you straight.That would be good for a change, son.So what did you guys do?Well, we drank some.We smoked some.We listened to some very loud music, some of it that rock and roll that you call the best kind of music ever invented.But we didnt just listen to it.Some of us danced as well, fast and slow.Did you dance?Yes, I danced with a lovely girl, a young woman with some great moves.We danced quite a lot, actually, quite a lot.And then?And then what?And then what did you two do after you danced?Well, we sweated a lot, because most of the dances were fast ones, my jeans and denim shirt are kind of warm, and she wore a heavy sweater.Come on, you know what I am asking you, son.Dont play cutie pie with me.Well, we left together, and I walked her home.She lives on the other side of town.That is one reason why I just arrived here at around one oclock.It was a long walk.And I got a little bit lost on the way home.You have your mothers sense of direction, son.But dont ever tell her that I said that. Do you hear, young man?Never tell her.Not a word, will I say, not a word.And you dont have to buy my silence, unless you really want to.You could rent it right now for a small fee.Is mom awake?No, she would not be awake at this indecent hour.Now answer my question.Are you asking me for juicy details then?Not details, no.I just want to know whether you got a kiss goodnight.Thats all.Its kind of complicated.Are you sure you want to hear the whole story?Okay, now you have me wondering what the hell happened.You have to tell me now, son.Well, it went like this.We walked up to her front door, and she turned to face me.I was just about to give her a big sloppy kiss, when the door opened, and she almost fell right into the hallway.Well, youve really got me interested now, son.What happened next?Her father happened next.He appeared at the door.He glared at me, and then asked Sheila, thats her name by the way, almost the exact same question that you asked me. What time do you think this is young lady?And did she give the exact same sarcastic answer?No, it was alittle different.She looked at her watch, and said My watch says that it is a little after twelve oclock.You two are a good match then, both gifted in smartass.My thoughts exactly, except for the smartass label.She then said, An hour passed my curfew, I know.So I am assuming, then, that you didnt get a goodnight kiss.Not really, dad.Not really.Okay, kiss and tell, son.Even though he was glaring at me, I spoke to him in a way that I think was respectful.What did you say? I want to hear what your respectful sounds like, just in case I ever get to hear it sometime.I told him that I was totally the one to blame, that I was the one who kept on insisting that we have just one more dance.So you were listening, then, when I told you the story of the girl that I kept up past her curfew, and who had been grounded by her parents.And of how I called her father the next day, and apologized to him for keeping his daughter out so late.Did you ever go out with her again, then?No, she was still grounded for a month, in which time I started going out with your mother.You shameless flirt.So what happened next?Didnt he tell you never to be with his daughter again?No.He told me that he respected my honesty, which is kind of ironic in a way.What do you mean, ironic?Well, our continuing to dance was a mutual decision. I didnt want to mention that. I knew that would get her in trouble with her dad.I want to be able to see Sheila again.Okay, so what did happen next?What did Sheilas father do after you little-white-lied with your apology?He shook my hand.Then he turned and walked away, saying that he was very tired, and needed to go back to bed, right after he went to the bathroom for a long pee.Okay, Dave, please tell me what happened after thatWell, dad, Sheila stepped outside with me and softly closed the door behind her.And then?And then?Well, with the long pee time that her father gave us, we kissed, dad, and were able to exchange phone numbers and e-mail addresses on our cell phones.You know, Dave, you are more like me at your age than I thought you were.Thanks for that, dad.From what you just said, I think that is true.I am carrying on a family tradition of male relationship excellence.So Dave, would you like to have coffee, maybe with some of those cookies that your mother baked?Sure dad, sure.We can talk about your old times."
The Grocery Clerk,"I have arrived at work for another day of being a cashier. There are certain aspects of my job I truly enjoy but then again here comes Mrs. Highsmith to my checkout stand. She always lets her kids open the chips eat them and hide the bag before paying. Today I am going to tell her its company policy to pay for all goods before consumption.Hi Mrs. Highsmith. Hello Sandra. Steph sit down. Roger leave your sister alone. Margie get out from under the basket immediately. Did you hear me Margie? Don't make me call your name again. Mrs. Highsmith your kids have... Yes, Sandra. Stop it Steph. You are going to fall out of the basket. I already told you once. Aaaahhh said Mrs. Highsmith in desperation. You were saying Sandra? Oh, oh nothing Mrs. Highsmith. Do you want paper or plastic? Neither Sandra. I brought my own bags. Okay, Mrs. Highsmith. Enjoy your day.Oh, no! Here comes Mr. Long. He is well known around town.  He is a retired school music teacher whose school had one of the best marching bands in town.  His school band won many competitions in their heyday.  He always brings a bag of change to pay for his groceries. Today I will tell him to please use another form of payment.Glad to see you Sandra. Mighty strange weather we've been having. I know. ""It is suppose to warm up later in the week,"" said Sandra. You know Sandra I can't wait to show you some of my new pennies from 1965 and 1955.  I just pulled them out of my collection this morning and cleaned them up. Well, you know Mr. Long it would be easier if, if...If what Sandra?Well, I can'[t wait to see those pennies.Sandra looks up and spots Mrs. Harris. She loves to tell long monologues about what happened when she was young. I'll just move her groceries fast and tell her I have to go to break.Hi Mrs. Harris.Hello, Sandra. It is so good to see you. You look like you're losing weight Sandra. You know in 1985 I had my own catering service. I ran it for nine years. I accidentally slipped on some flour one day, broke my hip in two places and I was out of commission for three months. After rehab I decided I would hang up my apron and find a job that required more sit time. Sandra you know what I decided to become a seamstress! You keep looking at your watch Sandra. Do you need to go somewhere? Oh yes, no, no. It's a new watch. I'm just excited about it. Very nice, Sandra. Very nice. Oh, I see your line is getting quite long. I guess I'll see you next week. Remind me to tell you about my seamstress work. ""I can't wait Mrs. Long"", Sandra answered dryly.Suddenly a loud gum popping sound can be heard from across the store. It is getting louder and louder as the customer approaches. It is none other than my classmate from high school, Tameka. She always stands in line popping, smacking and blowing bubbles before choosing three new flavors of gum for the week. She has to pick up almost every brand shuffle them around and leave it in a mess for me to have to straighten up later. Today I will tell her to please straighten the gum packages and put them in the same place they were in before.Pop, pop, smack, smack, smack....pop. Hi SandraCan I help you find something Tameka? No, Sandra. You all have the same old brands that you had last week. Smack, pop. I might have to start going to another store.Oh, another store probably would have a wider selection for your taste Tameka. I don't know Sandra. This is the third store I've been to today and I haven't found a very good selection at any of them. Pop, pop, pop....smack. I guess I'll go with these three packages.Tameka do you think you could....Pop. What!Oh just......Pop, pop what Sandra?Never mind. That will be three fifty.Suddenly Sandra spots Mrs. Smith. She always forgets at least three items and wants someone to go and find them for her. Does she ever make a list? Does she realize that by holding up the line I have a bunch of angry customers behind her ready to bite my head off when its finally their turn. Please don't pick my line today Mrs. Smith. Why me? WHY ME? Here she comes. I am going to tell her I am short on helpers today.Sandra I am so glad to see you. I have been all over this store looking for chicken bouillons. I went down aisle three twice. I went down aisle four three times. No luck. No luck at all. You know Sandra this store seems to be getting bigger and bigger every time I come. They also keep moving stuff around. I think I need to put in a complaint to your corporate office to leave stuff where I can find it or hand out maps. My feet are tired by the time I do all this walking in this store and today I have on heels. Can you imagine how my corns on my feet are aching Sandra? Anyway, Sandra, can you please have someone find the chicken bouillons for me and I just remembered I need napkins and toilet paper. I am down to two rolls. Two rolls does not go far in my house.Mrs. Smith we are very, very.....Sandra, I am so pressed for time. Please call someone for me. I have to get home and get out of these shoes. You will hear my feet hollering any minute now.Will do Mrs. Smith. I will get someone right on it.Thank you so much dear.My manager approaches and says heavenly words to me. Sandra you are on break in ten minutes."
The Chicano girl,"I thought everything was going very well until Camila had another surprise for me in the second half of January.Can I talk to you about something? she said one evening after we sat down to eat the burritos she made the previous night.Of course, I replied but then I started having a bad feeling when I saw her staring down into her plate too long without saying anything.We wont be able to make love for a while, she said finally, still not looking at me.I could see that she was struggling to find the right words to continue.Do you care to tell me more? I tried to encourage her.All right, she said after a sigh. I was at the doctors office today I had an abortion.An abortion?! I raised my voice unwittingly.Not your child, she said quietly.I was waiting for her to say more.You know what a late term abortion is? she asked looking up from the plate.Dont tell me you were five months pregnant! I responded.Why, you wont believe me? She sighed again and leaned back in her chair.I did not know what to say.Look, she continued, I didnt know I was pregnant. Just found it out recently and it had to be my decision whether to keep the child or not. I did not want to burden you with my problem.Do you know who the father is?Of course, I do.I lost my appetite for the other half of the burrito. I excused myself and went to brush my teeth. My brain became numb; I just did not know what to think.By the time I returned from the bathroom, she had turned on the television in the living room. She was watching some kind of soap opera that did not interest me at all. I did not want her to think that I was angry or upset, so I sat next to her on the couch.She turned off the TV after a few minutes.You probably hate me now, she said quietly.I dont hate you at all, I responded.You just dont love me anymore, is that it?I didnt say that, either, did I?But you probably think that way.I dont think anything right now, I said. I had a tiring day at work. I should just go to sleep.She started undressing. She took off her skirt.Do you want to see? she asked.Instinctively, I glanced at her underwear. I could see that it was padded with gauze.Still bleeding? I asked pointing at the reddish spot on her white pant.I dont think so, she said.Our mood was definitely not the usual.By the time Camila finished with the bathroom, I was half asleep on the couch.Arent you coming to bed with me? she asked.I followed her to the bedroom. We went to bed and then I kissed her good night.Sweet dreams, darling, she said and turned towards the wall. She usually slept on her side to avoid snoring. Soon, she was asleep.  Is that okay if I sleep on the couch? I asked her the following night.At least you wont hear my snoring, she said with a laugh.So, I went to the living room and fell asleep in no time.What woke me up in the middle of the night was the voice of a man. He was shouting something outside repeatedly but the only thing I could understand was Camilas name.Next thing I saw was the light coming on in the bedroom. Camila tip-toed through the living room, quietly opened the front door, and stepped out into the hallway.The man never stopped shouting.I heard the squeaking of the main entrance door downstairs, and I was wide awake by then. I quickly jumped off the couch, hurried to the half way open living room door and stuck my head out into the hallway.The conversation I overheard went something like this:Come on, Bruno, Camila said, stop waking up the neighborhood.Camila, my love, my dearest, my only one My darling! the man raised his voice gradually. You know how much I love you and you dont even return my calls anymore.Please, Bruno, quiet! And please, go home, said Camila almost begging. Its midnight. Please, go home.Camila, my love, you are carrying my baby, the mans voice turned kind of painful. Let me in! I need to be with you!Bruno, you are drunk, and you are too loud, Camila responded. Please, go away!Darling, you must love me, for our child. If you throw me away, Ill kill myself.	The quarreling went on for about half an hour and I began to feel extremely uncomfortable.	Finally, Bruno left and Camila was coming up on the stairs.	I quickly went back to the couch and pretended I was sleeping.	Of course, I had another awful night.	Next day, we both left for work at about the same time.	It was Friday. When I arrived in the bank, I went straight to the managers office and handed in my resignation.	No, you cant leave! the manager said. You just started working here.	Im sorry but something happened in the family, I cant stay any longer.	Well, I can see you are disturbed, so I believe you. Here is your paycheck for this week, I wont deduct this last day. Let me know if you change your mind or just show up Monday morning.	I quickly drove back to Camilas place and packed my luggage. I only took with me what I brought from the East Coast, leaving behind kitchen wear and other items I acquired in California.	The pressure lifted from my brain when I entered the I-10 Freeway, and by the time I was climbing the grade on I-15 towards Victorville, I was able to breathe much easier.	When I arrived at the fork where I-40 branched off, I stayed on I-15 without a moment of hesitation. I was heading straight to Las Vegas."
Not Picture Perfect,"Kayla hugged herself as she read through her chats. Her relationship was only few days old but she felt like quitting already.   She had sent Dylan a text five daysdays before but he was yet to answer. She kept loading and reloading, waiting for his text, but it didn't pop up.""Didn't he see it?"" She muttered, her thumb swiftly wiping sweat off her brows.    All the messages she had sent were marked seen yet there was still no answer. She didn't want to dwell much on it but she just couldn't hold it in.""080..."" She reeled off under her breath. ""Should I dial it or not"" she asked her dog, Greg, patting him gently. Greg's ear perked up in response and Kayla sighed.    Why was she hurting? Her accepting him was like her gift to him, or so she thought. She had helped him out of a toxic relationship and she very much wanted to be worshipped.Dylan picked after the third ring,""Hey"" he grunted. Kayla cleared her throat and pressed her lips together.""Dylan, how are you doing? Just called to check on you""""Fine."" He mouthed, he probably didn't feel the need to ask her how she was doing. For some minutes, neither of them said anything.    Kayla cleared her throat again. She felt like saying there was on her mind. Like telling him she had to restrain herself from blocking him. But instead, she said,""Have you eaten?'""Yes.""""Are you busy?""""Yep"" ""He paused for a while then continued, ""Is there anything you want?""You're busy, right?"" She asked again,picking the dirt residue in her nails.""Yes, I am,"" he stressed.""Oh okay then"" she mouthed and reached for the end call button.""Kayla what's wrong?"" He sighed, Kayla could almost see him rolling his eyes.   Kayla was not taken aback by the question but it did break her shield. She once again felt like telling how being in a relationship with him sucked. That it was all out of pity.""What's wrong?..."" She scoffed, wishing she was saying it to his face. She continued,""What's wrong is you!""""Kayla, what are you talking about?""""You know what? I don't feel like having this conversation."" She sucked her teeth and ended the call.   Kayla kicked off her slip-ons, jumped on her bed and slipped under the duvet.""Greg don't you look at me that way"" she barred her teeth at her dog whose head was tilted sideways.""I could have ended it there and then. How pathetic do I look now?... When next I see him I'm going to tell him how much he fucked up"" she gritted her teeth, her eyes cold and blank.  She couldn't bring herself to pick his calls, read the texts he sent or call him. She grunted and pressed her face to her pillow.**** ****  Kayla walked to his workplace in long strides, a grim expression etched on her face. She was going to make him pay.""Hey!"" She made her way to him and stood akimbo.""Whatcha think? You think I like you, you think I care about you? Man you're so wrong""   She lunged at him, grabbing a handful of his cloth. Dylan's lips were moving but she couldn't hear him. His voice came out muffled like the voice of the people gathering to watch them. They all spoke like they had cotton in their mouths.""I can't hear you,"" she shrieked as the muffled voices became louder and louder.   The loud pounding on her door woke her up from her sleep. The dream flashed before her face and she sighed in exasperation.Who could it be? She didn't know, she had no friends and her parents had not informed her they were coming over.""A minute please,"" she called out as she wiped her dog's hair off her pyjamas and smoothened her hair with her hand.   Kayla didn't even confirm through the keyhole before she opened the door. She was so sleepy that she wanted to get through with whatever it was.""Hi"" Dylan breathed out, his hand held limply before him.   Kayla thought she was still asleep, but, as though to reassure her she wasn't, the harmattan wind roared fiercely; she shivered, tasting dust.She applied moisture on her dry lips and raised a questioning eyebrow.""What are you doing here?""""Kayla... I,""Kayla tutted, her hand raised to shush him.""Dylan... She paused, a faltering smile on her face.'Just go away please"" she muttered, stifling the yawn threatening to break loose.""Kayla I love you"" he mouthed, his eyes spoke a thousand sad things.""I don't Dylan... I don't love you."" She forced out.    She felt like telling him everything was a cruise,that she didn't feel as much as a tiny spark for him. That she was way out of his league, that it was all out of pity. Again, when she could have spoken her mind, she banged the door on his face and rested her back on the door. Greg came out of the shadow and nestled in her arms.    Kayla laughed a little, she was already getting used to the feeling of being wanted. Of being loved. She cared and she didn't. She felt the relationship hanging on Dylan's crushed heart. She didn't know why she didn't say all she wanted to.   Maybe it for fear he'd be broken then he already was. The crushed look on his face still haunted her. She wasn't at fault, she thought. But then, she was not so sure.   She tried to know why she had accepted but she couldn't find any, not even a slight tugging at her heart.   Being the sociopath she was, she dated people who had something she needed, this one was different. He had nothing to give and she had something to give.She picked up her journal and wrote,""This is different"" she didn't care that it had ended. It really was an experience she'd wish to have again.****. ****This isn't part of the storyHarmattan is a season in West Africa which occurs between the end of November and March. It is characterized by dry and dusty wind.Cruise is a slangy word in West Africa, particularly Nigeria. It means to have fun at the expense of others."
Polka Dot,"Make me happy.Dots arms sink over the edge of the railing and sift through the salt-speckled air. The sun slithers onto the rough angles of the waves and appears like snakes of light dancing in the corner of her eye. Adelaide is also there, in her peripheral vision, her stomach swollen and stretching the front of her floral blouse until the threads peel and screech.You will, wont you? Her voice is camouflaged by the whispering thrum of the boat.Adelaides hands are unconsciously orbiting around her tummy and Dot recalls when she first found out about the baby. To be honest, she was a little late in knowing, showing up to their monthly lunch date trailing shoe laces with plastic wings everywhere she went. She was even out of breath, her heart playing with a toy drum once she heard the news.I thought youd gained weight, Dot joked that midday. Emotionally overeating because you couldnt stop thinking about me.Adelaide bumps her shoulder like she did back then. The suns robes wash over the sky and it begins to settle onto its afternoon knees.Dot gazes at the island. It looks small from a distance but every broken window is a black eye staring at her. The trees grow in uncomfortable directions, their long arms of wood squirming limply between the leaves.Adelaide had told her over the phone itd be a fun experience and a chance to catch up. Dot with her leather purse knew she was pregnant but apparently forgot. Because now, as her best friend retires onto a lifejacket chest, one knee jetting forward and the other stabilizing, she thinks of something else. Adelaide begs her with her fingers intertwined and the leftovers of a seagull dropping tangling in her hair.Its unfortunately the same position Dot was hoping Adelaide would be in someday, holding a ring and swallowing messy rivers of words and ocean water.But there was already a ring compassing her finger. One that was painted gold by the cheap paint you can get at Michaels and that has a shimmering, fake diamond glued carelessly onto the tip. It was either made by Ted, her husband, himself or a factory in China. Either one.Dot sighs. I need some time to think about it.I understand, Adelaide nods, caging her stomach in her hands. I just need to know by my baby shower, which is on Tuesday. Is three days enough?Clinging to the rails of the boat with what sanity she has left, Dot smiles. The island grows ever nearer. She gulps, glancing at all the strangers around her, bundled up in scarves and hats with pom-poms. She wonders if theyre thinking about the island and the haunted, abandoned hospitals on it. Their eyes reflect the gray waters and some turn when Adelaide complains that the baby is having a synchronized swimming lesson inside her belly.Babies always complicate things, Dot mutters. Adelaide hears her and pinches her earrings but says nothing. Just to be clear, though, I wont have to wear pink fabric wings and pretend to make a molding pumpkin and some rats into a horse-drawn carriage?Adelaide laughs lightly because she knows if shes too loud itll hurt. But the wind whisks the tinkling sound away, back to the mainland where they sell ice cream with rainbow sprinkles in the dead of winter.None of that, no, she faces away so her hair flutters into her face in soft waves.Dot taps her nails against her palm where shes written conversation topics. Her handwriting is sloppy but she can still manage to decipher it. So whats the gender?The chatter of the strangers in the background dulls to the melody of a gentle him. Adelaide opens her lips like shes going to laugh again but no sound escapes. Like Id tell you. Everyones going to find out at the shower. I dont even know.Dot frowns, How do I bring a helpful gift if I dont know the gender?Adelaide laughs, and for a second it seems like all she can do. Just laugh until the waves crash and lick her cheeks and carry her away. We both know youre not bringing a gift.She always tells the truth, behind maroon veils of velvet. Its part of the reason Dot has to hold back from cradling her and kissing her soft lips when tears blossom and glimmer under her eyes. Adelaide has blue eyes, she always has. And now her baby will too.I love you, does somersaults in the back of Dots throat. But she could never say it aloud so thats where it stays. It hisses through her teeth and relaxes onto the clouds.The baby does somersaults in Adelaides stomach. She grits her teeth. The boat has just arrived at the island and Dot already wants to turn around.* * *Adelaide was right, she brought no gift. Dot waltzed into the baby shower, her hands caught in the pockets of her sweatpants, and her hair tied up with a pencil. And she felt fine.Aphrodite, you came. Adelaides mother greets her with a salty smile like grains of sand are stuck between her teeth. Dot doesnt notice this but she notices the balloons. Theyre swelling into the ceilings of the house and theyre different varieties of a beautiful periwinkle. A girl.Dot knows the responsibilities of a godmother. Shell have a female godchild who will be treated like a princess when around her. With sparkly ears of Minnie Mouse headbands and polka dot dresses that sweep the floors. And crusted makeup that washes off like a temporary marker. Theyll tell expired dad jokes, laugh, and listen to old songs on the radio in her tree house.But somehow, it scares her. The girl will be tumbling into her dried palms if something were to happen to Adelaide. And Dot didnt think shed be able to handle it, seeing the woman she loves in the childs robin egg eyes every day.You made it, Adelaide sings, her voice lilting like in an elementary chorus and her chest rising and falling steadily like the tide.Dot sucks a breath in. Ill be the godmother.Her face cracks and the weary, timeworn, two-in-the-morning-mugs-full-of-coffee mask crumbles away to reveal a heartbreaking smile. Thank you so much. Adelaide rushes forwards and tries to lock her arms around Dots neck but her inflated stomach is blocking the way. I love you, my goddess of love, she murmurs into the depths of her ear.Dot smiles. She thinks itll be okay in the end, her and the princess and their somersaults through grassy hills until the end of time."
An Old Sort of Library,"There was a stirring on the far end of the building, and Miss Naila wasnt having it.Naila understood the variation in response that people had for the collection, but she would not have disrespect of the halls.So now at attention, she went about finding the source.As it turned out it was a pair of children, one bold, one meek.The meek one shivered at her appearance, which Miss Naila felt was good manners.What is it that has you in this little Din?The meek one cowered, as the Bold one said, whats it to you?Im the librarian, thats my role.A librarian? Aint that like being a cashier?No, not at all, the physical requirements are consistent, but most other aspects are undoubtedly different, Miss Naila said, keeping such collections in order is a might bit more complicated than running a till.I dont know what's so fancy about that, the Bold one continued, You probably dont even keep the numbers. Cashiers gotta know stuff.You know visitors arent always this irksome.Why would I need to know that? Its not like its my job. the bold one said, still full of bluster.While the meek one remained panicked, recoiling from his friend's behavior.Miss Naila wasnt all that familiar with the truly imperious, why, in all her time in attendance to the halls she could only remember seven nearing the posture and conduct of the boy in front of her.Oh, I remember, your mother was just like you, Naila realized, the boys demeanor finally reflecting off her memory. She was a nuisance as well.You probably remember when my Grandma was playing like that, maybe even my great-grandma! You old bat!, said the Bold one, Besides theres literally no one else here!Now that aint true, and even if it were, you're still being a nuisance.To who?The halls themselves.Where does the hall get off having ears?Who needs ears to hear your ruckus?Were-were we really that bad?, asked the meek one, searching Nailas ever sharp features.Its not about how loud you were, its about your manners.Yeah, Im real sure of yours right? I mean you managed this entire time without introducing yourself.The Meek one was apparently unperturbed by this as he finally introduced them both, Im Ari and this is Savio, were running away.Really, doesnt much explain why you're bothering my Halls, does it?We were hoping to access one of the grimoires actually.Then why make a nuisance of yourselves?Things kinda warp around the service bell.Oh, Naila put the events in order, she did make her own trouble sometimes, I think I can help with that, what do you have on the grimoire you want?Well Savio actually found something on transmogrification a while ago, we realized that the story mightve been dubious. So mostly fact checking.Well, I know that we have at least one copy of the Shaw-Ajit, its a rather ancient tome on sorcery but its one of the oldest books containing transmogrification in the collection, Naila paused for a moment, Im sorry you probably dont know Martaba, I could order a translation.We dont exactly have anywhere to be in the meantime. Do you have any suggestions?She did of course, and Miss Naila was happy so long as they remained unobtrusive of the halls.They had decided to hold up in an older reading nook, Ari taking the likely senile old couch, while Savio took the chair.They decided to take one out of the collection for their own reading, even if they were unhoused for the moment.Savio read the brunt of the text to Ari, while he set his sleeping area.Miss Naila was much less bothered by such things in the evenings, than she was earlier in the day.Though like anything else time and its movements were arguable in the library.The children would wake up and leave for food, sure to return and entertain their host.Miss Naila could remain aware of most things happening around the collection, while they had been obstructive at first, their movements became much more familiar to her.Almost like the walls themselves.So how did you get here?, Ari asked her one night, while Savio slept, were you ever human?Miss Naila didnt bother answering, as while such things might matter to the young it was hardly a point of contention for the ancient.So, how do you know what the walls like?Im not exactly a mind reader but Ive been close to the halls for years, decades really.Are you a nonagenarian?I dont quite care, but I think your chair might be.Oh, Ari was as weary as ever, you ever think about Medieval underwear?The over aged thing that was the librarian giggled, Why would I? it was all just shirts.I dont know, underwear is generally pretty interesting, Ari cracked just about everything he knew to crack, before saying, Im sorry that Savios such a bad sleeper.Its alright, there's no point to punishing the sleeping.Ari rearranged himself in the chair How hard is it to get translations? I mean some have gotta be straight up antediluvian, right?I cant exactly say, but I know that for some there are no congruent copies.Ari paused before letting out a huge yawn, I should sleep before I bore you, or start snoring.Savio would wake first the next day, and he would pack their things for the day, so as to not be a nuisance.Ari had contorted somewhat in the night, and while he managed to engulf himself beneath the fleece the arrangement was uncomfortable to look at.Even for Miss Naila.The boys had been preparing for the shipment, and Naila was happy to add to her collection because of it.Savio was the one to ask for The Shaw-Ajit, a bit too early for Ari, as he was still trying to stretch the sleep from his joints.Miss Naila was almost sure they wouldnt manage to overstay their welcome."
memories of a house once upon a time,"People forget I have lived elsewhere. What is more astounding are some of my memories of people and places? Take, for instance, an old country house that people say is so wonderful. I remember it in a parallel reality. The story there was more shadowy. Less wonderful. The country house was right behind Club Missouri in Williston, North Dakota. That Club has or had or will have no less than fifteen ghost stories. Why? Some twenty or twenty-two people had died there over the past thirty years. Bars in the country are mysterious. But this is a story about the country house behind the Club. It was a large country house. Used to be a farmhouse prior to the city or town growing consuming it. There are many stories I remember about it. I suppose the one that it involved me with makes sense to start with. I was a dishwasher at the Club. I went outside after the dishwasher heat had made the kitchen area unbearable. This was a big night for the Club. People were coming out to have their Halloween fun. Dressed up as demons, nurses, etc. I had just wiped the sweat off my forehead when I heard the howling. Trying to figure out what was going on, I looked. Down the hill in the farmhouse I could see two dogs. One was lying on the ground, the other one howling. Trying to figure out what to do. A flash occurred, and both dogs were on the ground. No longer howling. Wondering what I had just seen, I watched. A huge hog with red eyes I could see came out of the underbrush and ate the first dog that was on the ground. Now this did not sit well with me. So I ran down the hill. Foolish. But I am me. The hog or pig turned on me. The other dog made it to its feet and ran away. Now running down hill sometimes I can not stop. I ran right into the hog. And poof. Poof it was gone. That kind of freaked me out. I went back to work. After washing plates. I asked about the hog. The cook laughed and said I was an idiot to stop the ghost pig. He then went on to tell this story. The house had been owned by a bachelor that hated certain types of people. Who or why? Remember this was in the early 1970s. Hatred of people was acceptable. The bachelor hated migrant workers. Specifically, the tale went that he would hire them. Work them hard and on pay day take them to a valley just south of the river. Where he would shoot them in the head and bury them. I scoffed at the story. However, later on another person told the similar story. So I went to the library to see if anything was amiss. Sure enough in the 1920s. The story had it that one of the first serial killers in the area had murdered five migrant workers. Reading more into the story, I found out that instead of burying the bodies like the tale told me. He had actually fed the bodies to his pet hog. That weirded me out a bit. The newspaper described the trail in detail of how the man would feed the people to his pet hog. The paper went on in full detail. That paper said a verdict was expected on Friday in the trial. When I went to look up on microfiche, the Friday paper of the 1920s it was not there. The next microfiche newspaper I could find read something dealing with a county fair. And how a hog had broken loose in the fairgrounds. It had terrorized everyone there and then disappeared into smoke. Seemed like I owed the cook an apology. So, I gave my two weeks notice at the Club. Having found a job at the Salt mines. A few months went by and a couple of work friends and I went to the Club because they had a live band that night. The band was playing Riders in the Sky. Just then, the couples on the dance floor were interrupted by two dogs running like something was chasing them. It was amusing, but to me I was a bit taken back. I was pretty sure one of those dogs was the one I had seen a few months prior. No. There was no ghost hog present. When the dogs left, the music got started again. In walked five migrant workers walked in. How could I tell? Their clothing and style. They sat down and did not order anything that I could see. Now this is that matter-of-fact tone of a ghost story. Remember that paper I had read? Well, it had shown a photo of the man on the trail. For the world of me. He walked right into the bar, too. And I think I fainted. He walked to the table with the migrants and sat down. Let just say I left at that. Several years went by. Lets be honest, I am not into ghost stories. People would invite me there and laugh at my facial expression of saying no thank you. Then one Halloween night I went there with a lady friend. We danced. We drank. And about the same time I had left in the first story, I could swear I heard a dog howling in the night. Sent shivers through my body, I suppose. The shadows in that Club were interesting. No, I did not see the hog or dogs again. I did hear about what happened, however, to the kids that dared each other to go into that old country house one Halloween.The story has it. Of the five that went in. Two were now locked away in the mental institution and two were no longer the top dogs of their school, having dropped out and started to live like bums. And the fifth one?Their story has it. That the hog with red eyes dragged her off into the brush and her body was never found."
Queen Briesef,"At the time of dark trees, when ambered skies turn purple.The Willow stands strong and tall, roots have all encircled.The faun plays his flute with the softest of breaths.The Sylphs and Nymphs emerge and set to the test.Then the mares come forth pawing the ground.Butterflies and fairies circle all around.As night falls, She emerges, The Queen."" Briesef of the Lotus city I be.Look me up, I've been around since before there was land.From the dark cold of Chaos, I was born on the windswept bands.Stars that strike up from the spot that gets dark.That explodes in beauteous glory out of Spark.It was a mystical connection.Extension of Fate's Intentions.Doubts were thrown aside, with serious introspections.She flicked her wings backward with deft precision.Then lit on the ground with a nice solid thud.With a smooth slick motion, she grasped a cow chewing her cud.The faun drew near the Dragon Queen.She was the most beautiful dragon he had ever seen!She was twenty feet long, tip to tip.The stories she told of her amazing trips.He bowed low as she crunched through bone."" Young one, get on with it. I will be traveling soon.""The precocious one said,"" Oh Beauteous one. With opalescent scales of white.Will you glide on translucent wings with me tonight?""She flicked her claw and shooed him aside.Snagging a salmon from the stream, unable to hide.Then she sighed and said, as she chewed upon a leg.""Encamped along the shoals,of the Obsidian Eastern seas.The sands of time that are dark and glossy,reflect visions now to me.Blurry images, of times, gone by.My heart breaks, and I begin to cry.So much sadness, deep within me.The essence of ""ME"", struggling to be free.I close my eyes.I feel the ocean spray.I sit down on a rock.Then close my eyes to pray.I never care who hears me.Just only if they'll help to guide.The energy that I'm unable to run from,nor would I even try.One or all,they are always there.Always lending a helping hand.An answer to a prayer.Celestial moonbeams,Strike the earth below in silvered strands of light.That glisten upon the ocean's waves,A flock of birds takes to flight.I breathe deeply, asking them all for strength.So many times, I have stood upon the brink.Trying to control my destiny.Intrinsically knowing that I could.I wish there was someone.Someone that understood.Torn between loyalty and Hate.Frustrated by desire.The ocean's wind blows out strong,Fueling the flames of my fire.Turbulent emotions.They caressed away instantly.A gift from the Gods answered from infinity.I stand upon a razor's edge,Praying that I don't fall short of my dreams.I look out at the horizon,Feeling completely loved by the Sea.From the mist and shadows,She emerges and reaches out to me.Mighty Freya's hand touched my heart,grasped my pain, and flung it to the sea.A mother herself,Who's known such loss and pain.The spray from the ocean,Feels just like rain.I am strong, but,This has been a heavy load to bear.I come here in my mind,look out at the ocean and stare.My place of comfort.In times of doubt.Obsidian black cliffs, that rise through the clouds.These my friend, are the lessons I have learned.If you play with fire, sooner or later you'll get burned.Never second guess yourself.The first answer's usually right.Reach within yourself,Feel the power of the Night.Find the right path.The right one for You.Always seek honor.Please, strive to be true.Love can be fleeting,Or stay the river's flow.It can make you yearn for things.It can make you all aglow.It can rip out your heart, tearing it to shreds.And, quite frankly, love can screw with your head.Never close yourself off, to love that could be true.Because If you never try, the only one to blame is you.Look for the beauty, in all that you see.And if you find yourself a split apart,You'll know how good love can be.The morning sun rises in wonderous splendor.Taking away the pain so I won't remember.Catnip, Sage, Hyssop, and Thyme.Something to take away the pain tonight.All the mystical illusions,Within the black obsidian stone.In this place of comfort,I am never quite alone.The dark voices of the past,The Images seem to flicker then fade.I will give them no more pain,Soon, in rejection, they retreat in vain.My lot is not cast,Nor is my fate set in solid stone.I am strong as the Goddess,The Maiden, Mother, and Crone.I am darkness embraced.I am a wondrous fire.I am cunning as the fox.The one who flees from the wolf.I am Faith defined.I am Beauty refined.I am Grace entwined.I am Fate woven true.I am the hand of Wrath when you have sinned.I am the strands of the divine, under my skin.Life truly can be woven anew.Guidance from the universe,In abstract purple hues.That shimmer and dance,In the black of the stone.I look back on my life and see how far I have come.Out of the darkness comes light.No more struggling through the night.As the sun cast its rays, upon the new day,My mind was no longer in disarray.The sky opened before me.A future was bright and clear.I stood strong in my power.With no doubt or fear.Wolf on the Moon.So many mystical chimes.One that has crossed,Through actual Space and Time.Split aparts, drawn, forever from their core.Each with their enchanted lore.Like a shard of ice, that I held in my hand.Water drips from my fingertips.Puddling on the place where I stand.I want a house in the hills.With Pastures of green.A place for my horses to run.Spirited, wild, and free.Seek Illumination, with all that you are.Our future is written in the stars. ""Briesef smirked.Her plan had worked.They were asleep.With looks of mirth.With translucent stillness,She takes to wing, she's just a dragon,A complete ornate wonder.Her piercing scream rends the thunder."
Journey Through Brooklyn,"Sara hated cleaning. So much so she avoided it like the plague.What part of it was fun? None.Sara was far too busy. She had two jobs, volunteered at the animal shelter and took online classes. At twenty four she wanted to spread her wings and live life.Ellie (her roommate) was the complete opposite.To say Ellie was a neat freak was under statement. The girl folded everything. She emptied the cast's litterbox daily, always made her bed and never left a dish in the sink. Ellie never seemed to mind that Sara was messy. Sure she made remarks somedays.""You better be careful in here you might lose your feet."""" I can always tell when your home alone the place starts to stink."""" One day your going to lose something important in this mess.""***The two friends dreamed of living in Manhattan. But they settled onBrooklyn for both the space and even better rent.The two girls had completely opposite schedules. They often felt like ships passing by. Sara longed to hang out with her best friend.And since Ellie was now dating Jack there just wasn't anytime.Sara liked him just fine but needed Ellie back. A girls night in was long overdue.At the end of another exhausting week she envisioned plans for the weekend.Loveseat, Netflix, cuddles with cat and plenty of pizza.Another bonus of Brooklyn. And exactly in that order.***At five thirty Friday afternoon Sara entered the apartment. She couldn't remember the last time she was home before Ellie. She greeted Pancake at the door. He wound his silky tail through her legs as she tossed her keys in an empty bowl. He was eager to see her after being by himself all day. The cat scurried past her as she placed the mail on the tiny counter.""Who's a good boy? Buddy its you."" She told him.Sara changed into a graphic tee shirt and gray sweatpants.Ellie arrived home, Sara was across the loveseat with the cat on her lap. ""Your home early.""""I skipped lunch and left by five. Pizza is on its way."" Sara said.Ellie looked over the mail. Sara flipped through channels.""Hey, you wanna have a movie night?"" Sara asked her.""I have something better planned."" Sara looked confused.""You said Friday was girls night."" Ellie grinned.""I remember. I'm taking a shower. I will explain after.""***The night turned out better than Sara expected. Ellie invited two of their friends over. The ladies ate junk food, drank beer and laughed till after midnight. Sara must have dosed off. A loud noise on the TV woke her. She yawned and headed for bed.After four hours of sleep she woke in a sour mood. She had decided to tackle the mess in the apartment. And after two cups of coffee nothing would stop her now. She focused on the breakfast dishes first. Then emptied the trash, tossed the old mail and emptied the litterbox for the first time. Once the kitchen was defeated she headed for her bedroom. She made her bed and picked up her dirty laundry. The closet was a momentous task. But she had to keep going.She opened the doors and took a deep breath. The shelf contained everything from board games, shoe boxes, love letters, greeting cards and hundreds of books. Sara always loved reading.After rummaging through the contents for almost two hours she made three piles on her carpet. Keep, Trash and Donate.Three shoe boxes down and ten more to go.She lifted the lid on the next one. It contained a library book. Tribute by Nora Roberts. Sara had enjoyed this one.Upon inspection she realized it was long overdue.""Now I guess I'm heading to the library too."" She said with dread.***Out on the crowded sidewalk Sara hails a cab. The traffic was horrendous and the driver cursed more than anyone should. After only a few blocks the cab began to over heat and the angry driver ushered her out. She reached in her tote bag and felt the spine of her book.""Now what?"" She said to herself.The subway. But once she got on she remembered why she never rode the train. It was extremely crowded and half of the passengers had BO really bad. Sara tried to hold her breath and pray it would be over soon.No sooner had she thought this when the train came screeching to a halt. A loud voice broke in over head.""Attention everyone due to technical problems on the tracks we ask that you exit at this time. Thank you.""Sara leaped from the train car. She began to walk but lost her balance landing on the tracks. At that exact moment the train came to life and flew over her as she tried not to move.Out of the tunnel she stepped into Prospect Park. It was a lovely afternoon. A brilliant sun shone above. The park was full of families on Saturday. Some were walking, others rode bikes and a few hurried past her on skate boards. She wanted to be home before it was dark. She started to jog and ran until her legs burned.Not wanting to admit defeat she became desperate.She waited until the teens started talking. When they were good and distracted, she leaned over and scooped up one of the boards for herself. With the wind in her face and the book in her arms she felt to guilt at all.The park turned into the Brooklyn Bridge. Sara was dumb founded.She pushed the board aside and started to walk across. The day turned dark and windy. Her legs felt heavy and she slowly made her way to the middle. The more the wind howled the more fragile the bridge became. Sara started to panic when she noticed the suspension cables were swaying from side to side.  ""I've come this far I wont stop now! For all you book lovers!"" With fear against her and her heart pounding in her chest she pressed on. At the end of the bridge she could see the New York Public Library. A smile came over her face. Sara took off at a full run. When she got to the library the doors were all locked. ""No!"" She screamed *** Sara opened her eyes. She was sweating and out of breath. She jumped out of her bed and ran to find Ellie.  Her friend was at the table having her coffee. ""What's the matter you look a wreak?"" Ellie said. ""I had the most horrible dream. I cleaned up my room and..."" Ellie almost spit out her coffee. She started to laugh. ""Let me guess you lost the remote? No you fainted from the smell."" ""No, listen I was trying to return a library book but no matter how I tried, everything kept going wrong. It was awful."" ""Don't worry it was only a dream. Get dressed. We are going shoe shopping in twenty minutes."" ***  Outside their building, Sara begins to search through her bag.   ""Ok what is it?"" Ellie said.  ""I forgot my phone. Give me two minutes.""   Sara takes the stairs to the third floor. Inside the apartment she is unable to find her cell. She searches the kitchen but its no where in sight. Its not in her bedroom. She stands by the closet and thinks about when she seen it last.  With her phone in her hand she leaves. Pancake hurries into Sara's bedroom. He makes his way through her laundry and plops down on top of something. But he isn't comfortable. He finally scurries under her bed. The cat falls asleep along side Tribute."
A bookstore,"I had just moved to town. Exploring the streets, I came across a bookstore. The sign intrigued me, so I went in. The front counter was unmanned. And not a soul could be seen in the shop. were I went to the first shelf of books. Wild. Indie books. Hundreds of them all printed. Opening a cover of a book titled:  The book immediately impressed me with the adventure story. A writer trapped in parallel spacetime worlds. Traveling back through time to watch the end of the time of tribulation. The author. An expat from Montana. He wrote about how he had awoken been kidnapped from his reality. And lived day by day in parallel realities so close to him that few people would know the difference. Setting the book aside. I turned to the next book. The Mystery of Shade and wood stamps. An introductory book to Chiaroscuro. Turning the page. They delighted me to see the dark printings of master works. The light caught the edges of the sculptures. Making them look shadowy. Reading more into the book. It gave details of the first painter to use this technique as an Apollodorus Skiagraphos. The mystery here was the book showed old photos of his work. However, from the dates ascribed to the photos and works shown made me think this was a fictional book. Reason? Some of the color photographs were in Russia in the early 1900s. To be more specific. Czar Nicholas personal library collection of antiquities was in some subtitles. Reading more into the book. The author seemed to show that the library still existed and that KGB still had control of it. This made me smile. KGB had not existed for some time now. So I looked at the published date 1969. I suppose the book could reflect what the author knew. The book ascribed a certain magic to some paintings. Reading on. The author followed up with a story. Of Skiagraphos last known painting according to the author. There were three photos of Czar Nicholas. One holding what looked like a miniature vase detailing hunting with dogs. A portrait of some man. And a temple. Reading farther into the book. I discovered more detail about how the technique had gone out of style for a time. Then reappeared with Leonardo da Vinci. Here the author again showed photos of works from the 1900s. One with Czar Nicholas holding a lovely, shadowy woman. Subtitled Mona Lisa. The book in Russian subtitle also had an English translation. Which seemed to show that Czar Nicolas held at one time a miniature Mona Lisa painting. Then the next photo showed a larger version of Mona Lisa. Seemed to show that they took the photo in Saint Petersburg 1903. The book went into details. How the KGB was hiding some of the more notable Skiagraphos paintings from earlier times in a cold vault. The author detailed how underground vaults and cities were being prepared. To keep humanitys history alive. Now, I knew this was getting into fictitious reality. Why? The author detailed how Stalin had put together a plan to hide the best of the best communist. In cities underground. Then to use Russian resources to build large cities hidden so that no satellites could see them. Seemed to show that the USSR considered prepared for an invasion from space as a likelihood. Let alone that. But the author spent a chapter detailing how these cities of the shadow. How they would or could be constructed in secret. From key cities in Russias underground railroad. Someone evidently used the paintings as subtitles secrets. This was to hide how the USSR used two million slave laborers. To carve tunnels outside of the great Russian cities. Into underground bunkers designed to withstand attacks from space and nuclear war. The book went into details of the shadowy realities. Seemed weird to me. I read the next chapter, which became even more of a shock. The author wrote a complete story of how two of Czar Nicolas daughters escaped. Then lived in the shadows outside of Russia. My rough memory of the chapter. The tale of the princesses from memory, mind you. The author of the book named Jack. The group on the train is a combination of US and British soldiers with train men from the states. Jack got to know the brake man. He learned the entire group was off to save the Czar Nicholas II of Russia and his family. The train adventure was something out of an old medieval war story. The train, being a steam engine, would puff and stop due to the lack of coal. Several times along the way they put the whole attachment forth to cut wood, and or look for coal. Jack was useful knowing a little Russian and Yiddish from his grandfather. Jack also got to learn how to slow the train down by applying the brakes going downhill. One time people were out searching for fuel for the train. A group of locals dressed as Mongolians attacked the train with swords and arrows. The sentry with the steam-powered machine gun made temporary work of them. The British had to bribe both the White Army of the Czar, Bolsheviks, wild revolutionaries, and the Red Army of Vladimir Lenin. To get through the Siberian train railroad. Bribing into the White Army was easier said than done. A lot of the old Czars military felt betrayed by the Czar by his lack of leadership. One White General even ordered a bayonet charge against the train. While it was pulling away from a station. The tale of that ride brought me back for several visits to Jack, the junkman in Terry, Montana. There was the Japanese army of a million men who were taking up positions on the road. The bribe was a jewel the size of a babys fist to the general in command. Different groups attacked them several times. They held the train with three machine guns and a cannon. One of the more memorable tales was. When Jacks train had to back up fifteen miles because of no side rails to let the train of General Kaledin by. Jacks wild story here was more reflective in his face. Talking about how hard braking downhill was easy, but keeping a whole train at a steady pace. Sometimes on how going backward in snow was terrifying. After that he was tired however because he knew some Russian and Yiddish he was forced back to work. The tale Jack had. Described as General Kaledin. Then invited the officers, and he was drafted as their messenger for a night party. The party was like a medieval banquet inside a train. Drinking wine, vodka, and dancing with women. His tale was of several professional night ladies. The dancing, singing, and drinking more vodka and spirits than he could remember doing so in his life. All he did was watch. According to many medieval tales, the General was not such a good guy. During the night, General Kaledin required an extra bribe. Which the Brit paid several costly jewels and another ruby the size of a handful was the description. After that the train went to two stops to find the Czar. The first was a lost venture. Meaning the Czar had been moved, and the second was Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. They reached Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. This time an American office, a British officer/royal, and Jack, as a scout, went into Yekaterinburg. The British officer spoke flawless Russian, however, no one in public wanted to speak with him. Jack took the lead, asking for some bread. Jack was a quick child. Knowing some Yiddish allowed him to ask the right kids around the train yard to find the family. Upon getting to the house, there was not much to the tale. The officers bribed the local official. They were preparing to leave with the entire family. However, the family doctor said they could not move Alexei. The Czar would not go without his son. Finally, the four daughters could go. Getting back to the train yard, there was a run-in with the locals. One daughter was murdered there. Jacks description was not of an execution. More like a disagreement with the person accepting a bribe. Then that person trying to retake the four girls. Anastasia Nikolaevna got separated during a melee between the Brit and five Russians. The Brit pulled out a sword and rushed the Russians, cutting three of them down and forcing the other two to flee. Knowing that name Anastasia, I asked what happened to her? He said Anastasia was next to a building when the local official pulled out a pistol. And five men rushed the Brit and were being restrained by the Brit when the gun went off. They shot Olga dead. Jack only said that after they had shot Olga that Anastasia just was not there. One moment she was and the next no sign. There was snow, so he looked but could not find her. Anyway, after looking for a few minutes. Both officers, Tatiana Nikolaevna, Maria Nikolaevna and Jack, got back to the train. That was Jacks saving a princess tale. The fighting on the way back across Serbia was a wild tale. Jack, on over one occasion, was put in charge of brakes for the train. While the regular trackman went to sleep. Or was repairing parts of the train which kept moving as fast to the east as possible. There were three melees that Jack gave great detail about. First was when the Red Army in front of the train required that everyone get off the train and be searched. The diplomatic papers and bribes were not working this time. So the plan laid out by the Brit rather was to engage the Reds upon seeing them and open fire with the machine gun. This was the plan. However, the Reds brought only a few soldiers to the train. Someone easily bribed them when the wrong officer was in charge. Pulling out of the blockade. Things got crazy and the machine gun was used, cutting into several soldiers of the Red Army. The train moved along for hundreds of miles without seeing a sign of human life. Then suddenly there was a vast amount of people escaping the Red Army. The melee here was more sad. The people, Jack, said the people were just trying to escape the cold. But their numbers and rioting were slowing the train down. They ordered the soldiers on board to clear a path, which they did with swords and bayonets. The final big melee was between the Japanese and Red army. Which had sent several thousand troops into the area to secure the railroad? This part was interesting in that the Japanese at first deferred to the General. That had let them pass through the first time. But during their passing a new General arrived. He was more honorable or had not been bribed and was trying to retake the train. The melee was short of the machine gun, cutting down several hundred soldiers in an open field. The book said that the British officer married Titiana. That Maria ended up as a missionary in Africa. The book tale was fun."
FEAR OF DARKNESS,"Once upon a time there was a small city filled with bunch ofother-worldly or strange people living inside it. They were called so because all of them were afraid of darkness. The king ruling the city was the only brave one and was always troubled by this huge problem. He was teased by other kings about his management of the city. Because of this fear of darkness in the city, the king surrounded whole city with a blanket or wall of lightings. But king wasn't satisfied with this and wanted a better solution, he wanted his people to be strong along with him. He consulted this problem with many consultants but was unable to find a single solution. At last he got an advice from an experienced consultant to organise a competition in which the most experienced and intelligent people from all over the country will arrive and will be given a chance to take the fear away from the people. Among them, the one who will be successful in the given task will be honoured with different prizes. King agreed with the decision and did the same. Many of them tried to psychologically cure the people, some said that this problem had no solution, some were doctors who suggested them to take medicines, and much more. But the problem was really big. King was tired of the thousands of unsuccessful attempts. Finally when all options were finished, king left the hope and sent everyone back. He thought that now it was his own duty to do something for his people. He left his palace with his horse and swore not to return until he finds someone with the solution to his problem. For few months he travelled here and there, asking priests, bishops, monks etc. for his problem. To his surprise, he got only one answer from everyone. They suggested that he should call the famous monk from the neighbouring country. People said that he was a monk who had some magical powers by the Grace of God. King returned to the palace. He had no option left, so he decided to call the monk. Now, whenever this monk visited any city, he brought sucha wonderful gift for them that would change their lives in a moment. When the monk came to know that the king from this city was calling him to resolve the problem of fear, he agreed to come and announced that this time he would bring such a gift, that would take away the biggest fear from the city. His announcement spread in both the countries. This whole city shone with joy. Everyone understood that by taking the biggest fear, he meant that he was going to take the darkness away from their lives!! They started hoping from him, trusting him, and waiting for the monk to come. King was also delighted with the news that he was coming to change everyone's life once again. One fine day, the monk actually came! He came alone. He was welcomed like a god in the city. Everyone's wait was over now. No one knew, by what method, he would take away the darkness but still they prayed him. Monk came and met the king, as well as all the people standing in a crowd to see him with a great respect. He again made his phrase clear in front of everybody, that he said that he was going to take the fear away, not the darkness. People went confused and stood silently. The monk chanted few words slowly in his mind with his eyes closed. After few moments he opened his eyes and said the fear will end soon. Everyone was just staring him. He thanked the king to invite him, and went away from the city. No one expected this. None of them realised what happened until the dawn came. In the evening, everyone saw that the power supply of whole city along with the lighting wall was taken away by the monk, slowly leaving them to darkness! After that, it was like terror spread in the air of the city. Because of their lighting wall, or blanket around the city, they could not feel the moonlight too. They started wailing whole night in fear. They couldn't believe that the monk they trusted had done this. They were not able to understand which type of gift was it, that gave nothing but took everything the king had managed till now. No one found monk anywhere after a long search, he just vanished somewhere. King became sick in tension. His mind stopped working. He was unable to take any decision. It was a terrifying week for the people after that incident took place. In dark nights, there was no difference in the eyes closed or open. Some also ran away from the city. They started hating the monk more than anyone. But after that week, some of them became used to darkness, and was now trying to adjust themselves as per the situation. After one more week everyone adjusted with the darkness all around. Fear started ending for the first time. King was seeing all this happening actually. The moment, the fear of darkness ended, all the power supply came back in the city!! City was again filled with lights! No one knew how the light came, but now it doesn't mattered very much for them. They removed the lighting blanket from the city, as there was no need for that now. They still hated the monk for what he had done to them. They started to live happily ever after. Now they weren't strange or other-worldly for other people in the country and was now mixed with other people in the country. King was also delighted and felt successful but for him, it took years to understand that this was too, a gift by monk !!"
The Shadow Ball,"Only a corkscrew of dark hair spiked from under the childs light summer blanket.As slow as the sun, came eyes over the blanket horizon.Wispy curtains caught the slight breeze through the open window behind his bed, making hula dancer shadows on the wall next to the closet.The eyes widened in cartoonish terror at the sight of the  shadow.It was that cat again.Kaal Drogo, named after a Game of Thrones character. He was big and bold and dark, with lustrous chestnut fur and black tipped paws, tail and face, as if hed been playing in the ashy hearth.He was okay in the daytime.Fun to play with even. He loved Pas laser pointer and went all goofy over catnip.He even joined little Zack on afternoon hikes through the woods behind the cottage, walking ahead of him like a kings guard.Then, late at night, when the moon shone like a lamp through the window, the cat would be there, staring at the wall by the closet.Its shadow still, like a creepy Francis Bacon painting.The graceful black hula dancers swayed over and through it, but the shadow cat remained motionless.Zack grabbed an ounce of courage, threw off the blanket, and clicked on his bedside lamp.Warm comfort flooded the small but tidy boys room.Kaal Drogo turned and looked at Zack for a moment, puzzled by the boys frightened expression.He padded silently to the bed, jumped up light as a feather, made himself into a catball, and went to sleep.The next morning, five-year-old Zack came downstairs with his worn old green blanky clutched in a fist.He sat across from Zelda, his older sister and master tormentor.Zacky. You look like shit. Said Zelda.Zelda!Language! said their mom at the stove frying eggs.She plated the eggs, added toast, and peered down at her son.You really do look ill.Didnt you sleep well, Honey?No. replied Zack sullenly.His ma said, Well, youre going to take a nap after your bath.Cant have you looking like a zombie.Zeldas foot found its mark under the table and Zack cried out in pain.Shed put on her sneakers just so it would hurt more.She said, Ha Ha. Only baaaaybies have to take naps!Ma spoke up, Now Zelda, you were five once too.Be nice to your brother.Whatever.Im done eatin, Im going out huntin. She announced as she got up and grabbed her beebee rifle from the mudroom on her way out the door.Bye Baaaaybie!Zack held back tears, his face turning red in the process.Ma said, Dont let her get to you.Theyre just words, water off a ducks back.Shell grow out of this mean phase, just hang in there.Okay Ma. Said Zack.He did not believe it was just a phase.His ten-year-old sister had more than just a screw loose, she was as unhinged as a ferris wheel in hell.When Zelda came home that afternoon, she was in a good mood, which meant shed been up to no good at all.After Zacks nap, he went outside to play with his trucks.His apple red tow truck was towing the headless body of a squirrel.Zack shuddered as he looked around for his yellow dump truck.He found it.There were 3 sparrow heads, a chipmunk head, and the squirrels head in the dumper part and in the cab of the truck, a chipmunk with a Barbie head. Tears burned his eyes as he carried the tiny little bodies to his own secret cemetery in the woods.He said nothing at the dinner table.Zelda smirked at him.She had green fire in her eyes, daring him to say anything.Ratting her out would only make her crazier, sneakier, and more-mean.I guess Im still not feeling so well he said, Im going to my room.His dad, Hey hows about we go fishin tomorrow?Just us two.Okay Pa, thatll be great.Zack tried to sound enthusiastic, but in his heart, he knew Hurricane Zelda would be jealous.That was bad.That night sleep was a long time coming.When it finally stole his consciousness, he dreamt of a tiny army of creatures coming to tear him limb from limb then bury the parts in tiny graves.There were headless squirrels and chipmunks and birds.There were ravens with marble eyes, sparrows with spiders legs, and worst of all- a huge vampire bat, when it swooped over the army to face Zack, he saw it had Zeldas face.Zack awoke shivering, his sweat soaked body cooling in the night breeze.The curtain shadows flapped softly on the wall.And there was the cat!Tonight, the eerie black form faced the closed closet door. It was six feet tall, with extra pointy ears and spikey Halloween cat fur, not even a shadow-whisker twitched.Whats it looking at?wondered Zack to himself.A ghost?A boogeyman? A Zelda-faced raven?Zack clicked the lamp on once again and Kaal Drogo gave up his vigil and curled up by Zacks blanketed feet.At seven the next morning Zacks Pa came into his room to rouse him for fishing.Hey buddy, how you feelin?Zack said, Im just tired, didnt sleep much. He had developed bruise-colored circles under his eyes.We can call off the fishin for a day-No way! cried Zack.He jumped out of bed and started rummaging in his dresser for underwear and a tee.Okay! Pa laughed.Ill fix us some cereal.After dressing, Zack raced down the stairs.He dumped milk into his bowl and ate his rice crispies before they had barely any time to snap, crackle, or pop.After eating a slice of bacon, he got up and found his old sneakers in the mudroom, he ones he could wear in the stream.He shoved his bare left foot into a shoeand let out, AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!! when his foot slid into something incredibly slimy and cold.He pulled out his foot and strings of glutinous mucus stretched obscenely with it.SHE had salted some slugs apparently.Pa peeked in and said, Ok Buddy Boy, Ill meet you in the shed.Zack was determined not to let his witch of a sister ruin his day.He washed out both sneakers and put them on wet, the slug remains gone but not forgotten.It had been a wonderful day.He only caught one trout himself, his pa caught three.And no Zelda.Ma made his favorite meal that night, fried chicken with mashtators and corn on the cob.That night, he fell asleep heavily, his only dream one of slugs that quickly faded into non-memory as he awoke for a midnight pee.He peeked his eyes over the blanket, saw the shadow curtains dancing on the wall but no cat.He turned on the lamp and swung his legs around towards the hardwood floor.There was Kaal Drogo!Now it was staring at something under his bead!Nonononono. Zack moaned.Not under my bed?!Darn it! I thought as the boy turned on the light.The tip of my tail twitched uncontrollably.My whiskers bristled. I told myself it wasnt his fault.He was completely unaware of the ghosts that only I could hear, and only in shadowland.In the light, the tiny high-pitched voices petered out.I sighed and thought to myself, Well, hell be safe another night, hell be leaving the light on again.I hopped up to the bed and catballed. Zacks bladder eventually won out over the boogeyman under the bed. He knew if he wet it, Zelda would have a field day.After he left the room, I heard a soft, pssst.Huh?I stretched out to peer under the bed.Whos there?Come with me outside. Said the small squeaky voice from boogeymans land.A small brown furball skittered across the floor and out the door in two seconds flat.I followed.The tiny mouse hopped up and out my catdoor.Outside he asked me, Why do you scare the boy every night?Surprised, I said, Im not scaring him, Im protecting him! From the ghosts in the walls!Those ghosts wont hurt him, they were my family once, when that horrid girl was eight, she started killing them.First it was traps.Awful things that just about decapitate you.Then there was sticky paper that caught your feet so you couldnt run away.Ive heard stories from my cousins that she would watch the stuck mice die- slowly with no food or water.One day, she poisoned some peanut butter crackers.My brother brought one home to our burrow in the wall and all my family died long and painful deaths.Thats ghastly!How come youre alive? I asked.Allergy.Names Blimey by the way said mouse as he extended a teeny paw.I shook my pinky finger with his paw and said, Now I feel just terrible. I didnt mean to freak the boy out.Hes always been kind to me.We go hiking together.That girl child is out of control!She kills for pleasure- Ive spied her stalking the neighbors dog!When it comes close to our side of the woodsKaal, my friend, Ive seen her studying YOU, when youre asleep on the porch.Sometimes she has a bbq lighter in her hand, sometimes a switchblade.I couldnt suppress a shudder and asked. What can we do?I have an idea.You can talk to ghosts, right? the mouse asked.Yes, all cats can.I replied.As we headed off into the woods together, Blimey explained the plan hed been brewing.As we crossed a clearing our shadows flowed over the grass like rorschach inkblots come alive.I noticed how scary they looked, prickly like painted black thistles, and I felt badly that Id been freaking the poor boy out night after night while listening to ghost mice.When our shadows became one with our bodies, we knew that time was right.I called out into the night,Oh lonely spirits, cheated from death, and wronged in life, come forward to me for release.I repeated those words three times.Then gauzy pale shapes oozed out from trees, logs, bushes, even from an old empty snail shell.As they glided over, they took the shape of their living selves:chipmunks, squirrels, a skunk and her 5 babies, countless birds- so many they blurred the moonlite.Together, Blimey and I spoke of the evil girl that had taken their innocent lives away, leaving them to wander the woods unfulfilled and in confused limbo.Purgatory.We left the ghosts excited and eager to help.By the time we got back to the house the sky was turning from black to indigo.I hopped up to the foot of Zacks bed.I could hear the ghost mice in the walls chattering away but the tiny voices no longer worried me, in fact, now they made me sad.Blimey squeezed under the closet door to his home through the hole in the baseboard, just behind Zacks skateboard.Zack came half-awake as I formed my catball.He ever so slowly peeked out from his summer blanket.It had smiling yellow duckies all over it.Clutched in one small fist he held fast to his old, tattered security blanket.He breathed such a sigh of relief, youd have thought he had the lungs ofa ten year old.Only the curtain shadows painted the wall, barely visible in the early morning, still, with no breeze to orchestrate them.At the breakfast table Ma said, Zack, you sleep okay?You look much better today.I smiled as I sat by the stove, hoping for a bit of leftover sausage.I made my eyes big and didnt blink so theyd tear up a little.Works every time.Im fine Ma, feel great today. said Zack.You get all that gunk out from your toes? asked Zelda the Rotten.Zack gave her major stinkeye but said nothing.Wise lad.Safer to keep quiet.Avoid her wrath.The torturer announced, Im going out to the woods, going huntin. She grabbed the beebee rifle on her way out and I saw the bulge of her switchblade outlined in the back pocket of her cutoffs.Sausage forgotten, I followed Zelda outside.Her eyes squinted to cruel slits and I followed her gaze.The neighbors dog!Just a pup really.Zelda veered off to the left of the yard, the unsuspecting pup sniffing along the right side.Oblivious!Typical dog I thought.Later in the day, just before suppertime, Zack found a crucified rabbit in the middle of his sandbox.Dried blood crusted its mouth like garish clown paint.Where its eyes should have been bristled tufts of grasshoppers legs, sticking out like pointy sea anenomes.It had been disembowled as well, the gorey cavity held a babys face.Zack swatted away the dozens of lazy green flies greedily lapping the wetness.The young boy gently took the rabbit off the sticks, the doll eyes thankfully closed as he carried it into the woods.I followed.The cemetery covered more earth every time I visited it with the boy.It grew like a malignant tumor.Zack softly wept and whispered a little prayer over the small new mound May your poor little soul find peace in the darkness of death.May you play happily with all the other animal souls in heaven.The boy knew all animals went to heaven. Know that someone cried for you. This was a boy who cried for roadkill.That night he found a smiley face on his pillow, shaped from small worm-like intestines.He threw his pillow out the window.I silently wished the sweet child a good night and went to meet Blimey at the designated location.The two of us watched the dark yard and waited.As the moon rose, so did the shadows.Before long, the pale wisps of ghosts were dancing with the blackest of shadows.The yard was a beautiful ghoulish ballroom.Blimey and I went to Zeldas window.On this balmy July night her window was open.Soft pink curtains draped its frame, dusty lavender in the night.Blimey stood on the windowsill with a long branch in his paws.I took my place in front of the closet.My shadow six feet tall, then eight as I stood up on my hindlegs.Blimey reached with the stick to the shelf over the bed.He snagged a figure off the shelf, it was a blue bear in a police uniform, a piggy bank.It crashed to the floor, a cacophony of jangling and tinkling coins woke the girl.Whaaaa? she said sleepily.Oh my god! she said, spying the shadow, creepy and huge and silent.She gasped.Then said, Oh, its just you! You stinkin cat, get out of here!She reached down and threw a piece of pottery at me.I didnt even flinch. (Stinkin? Really? Moi?)I slowly turned around.As I came towards the bed, I was a shadow.But when I looked out the window at the moon, my eyes trapped the light.I was now a shadow with glowing eyes.Zelda said, Stop that! Whats going on?Youre crazy I should have stuck you ages ago!Put your dumb head on the little twerps transformer!She reached down towards her denim shorts in a heap of clothes on the floor.A three-foot shadow, viper-fast, darted out from under the bed and sunk its tiny but razor-sharp teeth into the evil girls palm, just under her thumb.She pulled her hand back, shocked.Blood spattered the pink daisied quilt, the droplets as black as our shadows.By then I was on the bed at her feet.I stared without blinking, my eyes golden headlamps.You dont scare me cat! she spat at me. She tried turning on the lamp.Her hand came away quickly from the knob, UGH! she said as she wiped the icy-greasy intestines on her blanket.When she turned back to me, I could tell that she saw them now.Ashy pale grey shadows swarmed in the air behind me.Zelda whimpered piteously.My shadow danced with the ghost of a skunk, her baby ghosts danced around our feet.Blimey danced with his dead relatives across the floor and the rest of the ghosts kept coming.From the walls, from the closet, from under the bed.Squirrels, chipmunks, rats, rabbits.And many species of birds.Zelda covered her eyes, not real, not real, not real. Dreaming.I pounced onto her chest, knocking her back against her sweat sodden pillow.I said to her, Youre not dreaming Zelda.If you ever wish to sleep again you will never touch that switchblade and rifle again.Touch your nasty tools and the ghosts and the shadows will dance in your room every night. This was a lie.After this night, the ghosts would be freed from purgatory and suffering.Although Id not spoken out loud, Im a cat after all, I know she heard me loud and clear.She started screaming.The next day was peaceful around the house.Pa had driven Zelda away in his old rusty Buick.When Zack asked where they were going, Pa said, Zelda is a little sick.Shes going to a special place until shes better.I know well all miss her but its for her own good.Zack said, Oh yeah, I will sooo miss her. He had to turn away because he could not suppress a grin.Eight hours later, just before supper, Pa came home with a gift for Zack.A puppy!A scruffy grey terrier mutt with a tail that wouldnt quit.Zack would never learn about the Shadows Ball, but I knew he deserved a happy life.It started now."
